At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks Tory. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides, including a supplemental information slide, are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.", "Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Matt goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $1.10 per share and full year earnings of $3.21 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight.", "Our reported fourth quarter earnings include a non-cash pre-tax gain of about $1.6 billion. The largest adjustment was the mark-to-market adjustment of our pension and OPEB liabilities, which was a pretax gain of roughly $1.8 billion. This adjustment which was primarily non-cash was caused by an increase in the discount rate as well as other planned factors.", "We also incurred pretax expenses of nearly $200 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plan. The net impact of these items after tax approximated $1 billion or $0.24 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.80 a year ago, a decline of 3.4%. For the full year adjusted earnings per share were $3.87 compared with $3.99 in 2015, a decrease of 3%. Recall that our 2015 adjusted EPS included $0.13 of depreciation benefit related to the three wireline properties that we sold to Frontier.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.", "Matt Ellis", "Thanks Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. I look forward to working with our investors and all of you who follow our stock and sharing progress in our strategy to deliver the promise of a digital world.", "We are in a vibrant and exciting industry. Our leadership position in wireless and fiber networks, as well as our loyal and high-quality customer base, is a reflection of our commitment to continuous improvement by our outstanding employees, which places us in a great position for long-term profitable growth.", "The continuous changes from technology advances and the competitive environment will provide us new opportunities to evolve and develop innovative solutions to continue to be the key player in this dynamic market. I\u2019m energized by those challenges and the great team we have and I am excited about the coming years. My primary objective is to build on the strong foundation of this business and ensure we are always being responsible stewards of the company by running the businesses we have today as efficiently and effectively as possible, while investing responsibly to deliver long-term growth and shareholder value.", "Let us now move into an overview of 2016. As expected, 2016 was a transformative year for Verizon. We demonstrated strong financial performance and returned value to our shareholders, while repositioning the business. Our core businesses are executing well in highly competitive markets, and we are on track with our strategic priorities.", "During 2016, we completed wireline divestitures of three markets, negotiated new contracts with our labor unions, executed successful 5G technical trials, and gained traction in new growth businesses. Operationally in wireless with our network leadership strategy, we added 1.3 million smartphone net adds and maintained industry leading retail phone churn performance of less than 0.9% for the year and for seven consecutive quarters.", "In wireline, we restructured the segment and its cost structure. Overall, we delivered solid operational and financial results, which I will go into in more detail in a few minutes. Our capital allocation was consistent with our strategy. We invested in adding capacity through densification of the 4G network, acquired Telematics, and Smart City businesses and extended ecosystems to monetize data traffic.", "We reduced our unsecured debt and delivered strong value to our shareholders through the 10th consecutive increase in annualized dividends last September. Entering 2017, we are confident with our strategy and priorities to serve customers and increase value. The foundation of our strategy is a network that is ubiquitous and reliable. We will continue to invest in our networks, expand network capabilities and advance ecosystems to offer value to our customers.", "The execution of these priorities will allow us to lead to the network layer and develop innovative solutions to meet customer demands in the rapidly expanding mobile first digital world.", "Now let\u2019s get right into the operating performance starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $32.3 billion, a decline of 5.6%. Consolidated 2016 revenue was $126.0 billion, representing a decline of 4.3%. If we exclude revenues from the divested wireline properties and AOL, which became part of our operations during the second half of 2015, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 2.4%.", "Wireless revenue tracked with our expectations in the quarter as the shift from service revenue to equipment revenue across our base of customers is ongoing. Equipment revenue was seasonally strong, primarily led by new smartphone launches and equipment installment take rates.", "Wireline segment revenues continued recent trends declining 3.1% with consumer growth of 0.2% for the quarter. In our new businesses, we are pleased with AOL\u2019s performance for the quarter and full year. In the fourth quarter, our digital media business, led by AOL, generated revenue of $532 million net of traffic acquisition costs. This revenue was down about 5% year-over-year as expected due to the revenue lift related to the Microsoft deal in the fourth quarter of 2015, but increased around 10% sequentially in line with our expectations.", "Organically, Internet of Things revenue was $243 million, up 21% in the fourth quarter. We expect to sustain these strong trends. Including acquisitions, Internet of Things revenue increased more than 60% in the fourth quarter. Strong cost management across the business enabled us to drive profitability, including offsetting the lost earnings contribution from the divested wireline market.", "On a consolidated full year basis, excluding non-operational items, EBITDA totaled $44.8 billion, and EBITDA margin was 35.5%.", "Now let\u2019s turn to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. In 2016, cash flows from operations totaled $22.7 billion, which is impacted by payments of cash income taxes of $3.2 billion associated with the gain on the divested wireline properties. Full-year capital spending of $17.1 billion was just below our guidance of $17.2 to $17.7 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $5.7 billion, which does not include the proceeds from on balance sheet securitization transaction.", "In the second half of 2016, we shifted to on balance sheet securitization of our equipment receivables as it provides us a lower overall cost of funding. As we have previously noted, the proceeds from our on balance sheet securitization program are reflected in the cash flows from financing.", "During the fourth quarter, we generated cash proceeds of about $2.4 billion from on balance sheet securitization for a total of $5.0 billion during the second half of the year. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $108.1 billion of gross debt, which comprised of $103.1 billion of unsecured debt and $5 billion of on balance sheet securitization.", "Our year-end unsecured debt balance was lower by $6.6 billion than the prior year. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.", "Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. In the wireless business, we are delivering a balanced operational performance in a highly competitive environment. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.5% in the quarter to $23.4 billion. For the full year operating revenue totaled $89.2 billion, a decline of 2.7%.", "Service revenue of $16.3 billion declined 4.9% for the quarter as compared to the 5.2% decline in the third quarter. For the full year, service revenue declined 5.4%. Overall service revenue trends are consistent with the postpaid base migrations unsubsidized servicing pricing. Approximately 67% of our postpaid customers are now on unsubsidized pricing, which is ahead of our expectations due to higher volumes in the fourth quarter. Service revenue plus device payment plan billings increased 1.7% in the fourth quarter and 2.0% for the full year.", "This deceleration in trend is due to the strong migration of customers in the second half of the year to unsubsidized pricing as customers fulfilled their price service contract. We are also seeing strong migrations to our new pricing structure that we launched mid-year with safety mode and carryover data. While these plans have resulted in greater than expected optimization they improved customer satisfaction and retention. Recently we launched a single line pricing plan to improve our competitive position in that segment.", "Equipment revenue increased to $5.7 billion, up 6.2% for the fourth quarter and 3.5% for the full year. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans increased to approximately 77% in the fourth quarter compared with about 70% in the third quarter and about 67% in the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect the first quarter take rate for device payment plans to be similar to 4Q as two-year service contracts are no longer available for upgrades by the embedded base.", "At the end of the quarter approximately 46% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan. Improving the cost structure of our wireless segment is a priority. We see additional opportunities to increase efficiencies in our operating model through the continued application of our Verizon lean Six Sigma processes. On total revenues, our EBITDA wireless margin was 36.9% for the fourth quarter and 43.8% for the year. In terms of profitability, we generated $8.6 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, a decrease of 5.2%.", "For the full year, total EBITDA was $39.0 billion, an increase of 0.2%. As expected, the equipment promotional activity in the quarter was elevated given the holiday season. We will remain competitive in the marketplace.", "In the fourth quarter, overall traffic on LTE increased by approximately 49% while we extended our lead in the industry\u2019s third-party performance studies across the country. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.5 billion in the quarter and $11.2 billion for the full year.", "Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter we added high quality retail postpaid net additions of 591,000 with a sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 552,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which are partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 456,000 net new smartphones.", "Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 167,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net additions totaled 196,000, which was 764,000 less than last year due to lower gross adds and higher churn resulting from previous year\u2019s promotions.", "Full year postpaid net additions of 2.3 million included 1.8 million 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablets. The primary offset to these net additions was net declines in basic phones and 3G smartphones.", "Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million for the fourth quarter and to 15.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in retail postpaid phone churn of less than 0.9%. Overall our retail postpaid churn increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn to 1.1%.", "Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.1 million in the quarter, down 1.9% and 43.2 million for the full year, down 7.3%. About 85% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. About 8.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, up sequentially and consistent with prior year.", "During the quarter, 8.6 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Net prepaid devices declined by 9000 in the quarter compared to a decline of 157,000 in the prior year. We are seeing sustained year-over-year improvement in retail prepaid.", "We ended the year with 114.2 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 2.1% to 108.8 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.", "Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment starting with a review of our consumer and mass-markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the wireline segment, consumer revenue increased 0.2% and mass markets, which include small business, declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, consumer revenues expanded by 0.4% and mass markets declined by 0.3%. Fios total revenue again increased 4.4% in the fourth quarter and increased 4.6% in 2016.", "Fios revenue growth was primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher Internet speeds. In Fios Internet, we added 68,000 net customers for the quarter and 235,000 for the year. We now have a total of about 5.7 million Fios Internet subscribers representing 40.4% penetration.", "In Fios video, we added 21,000 net customers in the quarter, and 59,000 for the year, and now have a total of 4.7 million Fios video subscribers, which represents a 34.3% penetration. Similar to prior quarters we continue to see strong demand for custom TV offerings. Our one-fiber initiative in Boston is progressing as expected and we launched consumer and business services to customers late in the fourth quarter.", "We continue to innovate with our Fios platform utilizing our fiber assets and earlier this month we introduced instant Internet, which is a new service that offers both upload and download speeds of 750 Mb per second. This service was introduced in New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and Richmond and other markets will see this service soon.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the wireline segment in total. Global enterprise revenue declined 4.5% and on a constant currency basis was down about 4% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 3.6% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3%. In our wholesale business as expected revenues declined 7.5% in the fourth quarter due to the impact of non-recurring items in the prior year.", "For the year, wholesale revenue declined 4.9%. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment declined 3.1% in the quarter and 2.3% for the full year. The impacts of the labor contract, workforce reduction and tight cost control supported improved profitability, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.1% for the quarter and 19.6% for the year. We expect to see continuing improvement on an annual basis with seasonal fluctuations.", "Capital spending in wireline was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $4.5 billion for the year. Regarding our pending wireline transactions, we expect the acquisition of XO Communications to close in the first quarter and the data center transaction to close in the second quarter.", "Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 to discuss our strategic position. Entering 2017, we are confident in our strategy and priorities for future growth and profitability. The foundation of the three-tier strategy begins with our commitment to invest in our best in class networks. Above the network layer resides our platform layer, which we are developing and creating new business models to monetize the ever-increasing digital traffic growth.", "Our goal is to be the trusted provider of connecting people and things and providing scalable solutions and analytics. Network quality and leadership is the cornerstone of this strategy and at the forefront of our brand value proposition to our customers. Today we are in the largest and most reliable 4G network in the country with market leading fiber assets.", "To expand our network leadership, we are executing on our strategic efforts to densify the 4G network, increased fiber resources and enhance spectral efficiency. As I noted earlier, we have initiated our next generation fiber network deployments in Boston. Fiber is an important element of our wireless networks as it allows us to strengthen our 4G LTE capacity, which also preparing for 5G.", "Our pending XO Communications acquisition will add to our fiber footprint and provides us with additional metro rings in 45 out of the top 50 US markets. 5G wireless technology is a focus for us. We are now launching about 10 pre-commercial pilots across the country with multiple use cases including dense urban and suburban neighborhoods.", "Our goal is to test the 5G fixed wireless technology in different environments in order to successfully operationalize 5G for a commercial launch. As noted earlier, we are expanding platforms and building new business models to monetize digital mobile video traffic on our network. In our media assets, AOL\u2019s content and ADTECH capabilities have enhanced our video offerings.", "With a focus on delivering timely, short form versions of video clips we have seen digital video consumption gain traction in the last year. At the content and solutions layer of our three-tier strategy, the combination of AOL, go90 and other content has enabled cross-platform sharing. This strategy expands our distribution and revenue opportunity globally across carriers and networks.", "We have seen increased usage in the go90 application through this exchange and we are expanding our unique content offerings. The average daily usage in go90 was consistent sequentially at about 30 minutes per viewer, with less than 20% of traffic surfed on the Verizon wireless network in the second half of the year.", "We are actively leveraging our content portfolio and have strategically focused on an add-supported model. In 2016 through our joint venture with Hearst, we launched unique content through Complex Media and AwesomenessTV, and we are looking forward to expanding these offerings this year.", "In addition, our extensive digital rights portfolio including sports such as NFL and NBA provide enhanced viewing experiences such as launching [stream pass] for Verizon wireless customers across multiple demographics. Our pending Yahoo acquisition will further increase our opportunity to scale in the digital media space with its 1 billion plus monthly average unique viewers.", "We are still working with Yahoo to assess the impact of the breaches and we have not reached any final conclusions yet. The Internet of Things including Telematics, is an area of opportunity due to this rapidly growing as it connected world expanse.", "Ubiquitous and reliable coverage to support the vast number of devices expected on these various platforms is a comparative advantage and we are developing this ecosystem to leverage our best-in-class networks while providing solutions of verticals such as transportation, energy, agriculture and smart cities. A great example of this is in the Telematics space with acquisitions of both Telogis and Fleetmatics, we became the market share leader.", "Our Smart Cities Solutions continued to progress and the business is augmented with the acquisitions of Sensity and LQD WiFi. As a result, we now have a deep inventory solutions on our IoT platform to provide to our customers. Overall, we are confident in our ability to execute deliver results and return value to our shareholders while continuously transforming the business. As we look at our current and pending assets in the media in IoT businesses, we will be focused on integrating these assets by increasing global scale organically and further enhancing cross platform content sharing opportunities.", "Collectively, these assets allow us to participate in the global ecosystem of the connected world. We see a clear path to revenue contributions from these integrated assets which will drive returns to the overall business in a less capital intended manner.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to slide 13 to review 2017 priorities. In 2017, our focus will be leveraging our network leadership positions. We will focus on retaining and growing our high quality customer base in both wireless and wire line while balancing profitability in this dynamic environment. Enhancing ecosystems in media and the Internet of Things let by Telematics will further drive the monetization of our network and solutions both domestically and globally. We expect full year consolidated revenue on an organic basis to be fairly consistent without a 2016.", "With improvement in wireless service revenue and equipment revenue trends, we also expect full year consolidated adjusted EPS trends to be similar to consolidated revenue trends. Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2017. Consolidated capital spending between $16.8 billion and $17.5 billion. Minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $600 million and in terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate of financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 34% to 36% based on current legislation. We will execute in the long term strategy to position the business for the future. With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you, Matt. Tory will now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please, we have the first question. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, you may ask your question.", "Simon Flannery", "Great, thanks very much. Good morning. Matt, maybe we could start with the last point on the guidance. Can you just give us a reconciliation up in new guidance versus the previous GDP type growth and the normal type EPS. What are the changes they are causing that? And on EPS, specifically, can you just help us reconcile what the base number that you\u2019ll be using for as sort of a flat kind of organic number would be for all the adjustments with frontier and the labor dispute, etcetera. Thank you.", "Matt Ellis", "Thank you, Simon for the question. Good morning. So yes, let\u2019s start with the outlook we gave this morning. And I\u2019ll start with the revenue. So, as you saw for now, we said we expect to see a consistent with 2016 on an organic basis. And we continue to see the revenue trajectory of the business improve. So, as you saw in the release, we expect that to be fairly consistent on an organic basis. So, this is an improvement over 2016, when revenues decline 2.4% on a comparable basis. So, let\u2019s unpack that for a sec and see how we get to that improvement from the negative 2.4 up to something is more comparable.", "And obviously, the major driver is wireless, where total revenue is down 2.7% last year and service revenue was down 5.4%. So, if we look into the service revenue component there, that trajectory improve throughout the year. We started in the first quarter of \u201816 down 6.2%, we ended the year in the fourth quarter down 4.9% and the year as a whole average down 5.4 as I said. So, as we expect that trend to continue to get better, we should see a better number year-over-year in wireless service revenue. Equipment revenue should also be higher given the higher device payment take rate which we expect to be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter which was a 77%.", "And so, obviously improve pending wireless, it will be the biggest factor year-over-year. And as you look at the other parts of the business, we expect wireline revenue trends to be similar, the 2016. And then Media Cover, we expect that will continue to build off the progress made last year. And then within the IoT businesses obviously included Telematics acquire a 21% in the fourth quarter. And we expect that business to continue to grow at a very healthy pace.", "So, on a combined basis, we are confident in seeing a better revenue trajectory in 2017 in last year. When you talk about the how we gave the outlook on revenue versus what we\u2019ve been saying previously. I think the biggest light and you got to look at in there is wireless service revenue. So, we continue to make good progress transition the base to unsubsidized service pricing and as customers come out of their two year subsidy plans, we see them quickly migrate to the unsubsidized service pricing.", "And we ended the year with 67% of the post pay customers now on those unsubsidized pricing plans. And so, while we were happy to have seen the acceleration, it does provide a head wind to service revenue. And then additionally, within service revenue we saw a higher level of migrations and then past pricing changes. To the plans that we introduced in the middle of last year and that functionality of those new plans appealed to our base. And we saw customers take advantage of that and not to might say a plan.", "So, those two development especially have essentially pushed out our expectation of the timing of the service revenue to return to year-over-year growth from the end of 2017 into \u201818. And as then as you look at the earnings side of it, obviously the largest driver of EPS changes is what happens in the wireless service revenue. So, obviously the service revenue being $66 billion, more than 0.5% of our total revenue. It\u2019s largest driver and so that\u2019s we continue to work through that service revenue migration.", "It is offset by the strong cost management we had across the business. And that\u2019s been a hallmark of our performance over the past few years using the Verizon Lean Six Sigma program that you\u2019ve heard us talk about previously. And that will continue to produce significant benefits in 2017 and will also see a full-year benefit in \u201817 from the new labor contracts. So, when you factor in all of the above, we expect to produce strong earnings again in 2017 and we talked about the trend we expect on EPS.", "You\u2019ve obviously got the impact in 2016 of one year of the Frontier properties in the first quarter and obviously the work stoppage. But in total will be around the revenue lines. It will be around where we were in 2016 as the baseline of our view for \u201817.", "Simon Flannery", "Okay. So, just to be clear on the EPS. It\u2019s we should take the EPS that you reported for 2016 as the base for \u201817?", "Matt Ellis", "That\u2019s a reasonable starting point, yes.", "Simon Flannery", "Okay, great. And just one last thing on the optimization. Has that sort of faded at this point or is that still continue at quite a pace. Was that kind of a three or four month effect, are you still seeing a lot of that going on?", "Matt Ellis", "Let\u2019s say and that still continue but we saw at a certainly an aggressive pace. Initially, after we launch those plans, so that just means the base moved quicker to those plans that we\u2019d seen in other changes. So, we\u2019re excited we launch product features where of high level of interest to our customers.", "Simon Flannery", "Great, thanks, Matt.", "Michael Stefanski", "Simon, thank you. Tory, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Philip Cusick", "Thanks. Just a follow-up first on Simon\u2019s question. Can you give us explicitly what the revenue number you\u2019re looking at in \u201816 sort of a normal number as well as the earnings number?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, the normal number for 2016 would be the comparable against the down 2.4% when you adjust out for the acquisitions over the course of the couple of years.", "Philip Cusick", "So, all right. So, exactly the dollar number that we should be starting with as the baseline to build from.", "Michael Stefanski", "Yes, I\u2019ll come back to you on that one. As to say, we refer of the down 2.4% year-over-year. It adjust out for the transactions in both 2016 and also the AOL introduction in 2015. So, when you adjust both of those numbers.", "Philip Cusick", "Right. And I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m sorry, go ahead Mike?", "Michael Stefanski", "No, I just going to say we\u2019ll get to you that exact number because it is both taking out Frontier for the first quarter.", "Philip Cusick", "Exactly.", "Michael Stefanski", "As well as we do make an adjustment because we didn\u2019t have a full-year of AOL. So, that\u2019s how we get to the negative 2.4%. But effectively what we\u2019re saying is that organically that plus not including any of the growth for new businesses, that would be the consistent number, but we\u2019ll get you that exact number.", "Philip Cusick", "Okay. And then just to make sure, when you talk about better trends and it sounds like you\u2019re looking for stability. That revenue number you\u2019re looking for dollars of stability year-over-year not stable down tick in percentages. Correct? Now down 2%.", "Matt Ellis", "Correct. Consistent on a dollar basis year-over-year and we get that through seeing improvements in the trend on the service revenue trajectory, the equipment revenue trajectory. So, in total across wireless and then also the newer businesses whether it be Media Curve or across the Internet of Things businesses, we continue it to expect to see those the revenue from those businesses improve in 2017.", "Philip Cusick", "Okay, that makes sense. And then on earnings is it 386 that we\u2019re using as the baseline from 2016 to jump off into \u201817 or is that a different number?", "Matt Ellis", "That\u2019s I\u2019d go off with 387 that we had on an adjusted basis, adjusting off for the mouth to market another items.", "Philip Cusick", "387 got it okay. And then if I just add one more new one, you talked about the gap tax 34-36 how should we think about cash taxes in 2017 under the current legislation?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, we would expect cash taxes to converge to all the effective tax rate during 2017.", "Philip Cusick", "So higher cash tax rate in 2017 than 2016?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, the cash tax is just purely on income obviously, our cash taxes for 2016 did include $3.2 billion of taxes related to the frontier transaction, we would expect to have cash taxes in \u201817 related to the disposal of the data centers, when that occurs at a lower level, but on the organic tax on earnings we would expect that the cash taxes to be closer to the ETR during the course of \u201817.", "Philip Cusick", "Okay, and do you have any initial thought on what the different plans of tax changes could be, anything you can help us as we model out the different impacts from border adjustments and things like that?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, so as we look at tax, we certainly, we\u2019ll be certainly, look it\u2019s a little too soon to tell, we certainly are supportive to changes in the tax legislation, we believe that we need to get to a more competitive tax environment and we look forward to working with congress and the new administration as Trump put new tax rate forward. Certainly a reduction rate would be beneficial, 100% expansion of CapEx would be beneficial initially, but the plans being discussed also include items such as removal of the interest expense deduction, and then as you mentioned, we\u2019re trying to understand exactly how border adjustable as it may or may not work, so certainly believe that tax reform would be a benefit to us, whichever year first it applies to whether applies to \u201817 or whether it initially apply to \u201818. We definitely seeing it being a benefit to the cash taxes we pay, but given the uncertainty on the specifics of the plan, it\u2019s a little too soon to say exactly how much that could be.", "Philip Cusick", "Can you give us an idea of within your CapEx and OpEx what other dollar number or percent comes from overseas and then I will stop?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve disclosed that number previously, so we\u2019d have to go back and look that back, we\u2019re not going to be disclosing that at this time.", "Philip Cusick", "Thanks very much.", "Michael Stefanski", "Phil, there is a reconciliation of the number of revenue that we\u2019re using in our financials that we released this morning on our website, but the number is $121.8 billion. So 121.8 would be the base for the revenue as we discussed.", "Philip Cusick", "Thanks Mike.", "Michael Stefanski", "Tory, if you could, next question.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik", "Great, thanks. Another follow up on the guidance, Matt obviously there is a lot of moving parts, but with the revenue trends and EPS trends sort of mirroring each other seems to suggest a route to roughly sort of flourish margin, but you\u2019re leading the year with real strength in wire line profitability. So first of all if you can talk about what\u2019s driving that and next is that to continue that should we, that the margins on the wireless side, but on the \u201817, should be sort of flat to maybe even down and maybe talk a little bit about that trend specially given the help that you should see from the removal of subsidies in the year? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, thanks John for your question, so starting off with wire line, certainly wire line had a good result in the fourth quarter, I would tell you as you say it in our prepared remarks that we would expect wire line margins for 2017 in the year as a hold to be higher than they were in 2016 and you\u2019ll see some seasonal fluctuations in it, as we typically do, so I would tell you be reasonable to expect wire line margins with the year as a whole to be in the low 20\u2019s compared to the 19% that we saw for 2016. So we see a lot of improvements going through the business, there obviously we\u2019re going to have the full year benefit of the new labor contract through there and we continue to manage costs in that business very closely in-line with the revenue trajectories, we continue to see kind of similar revenue to direct these for the enterprise and wholesale businesses and are excited about the files business which was up last year 4.6% on the full year basis, for files revenues and we continue to have more open for sale properties there, the great opportunities as we head into \u201817.", "On overall margins, when you talk about the wireless margins, this always comes back to where the service revenue trajectory is going to be. And so we certainly see improvements in the service revenue year-over-year, but we do go into the year off that 4.9% jump off point from the fourth quarter and we expect to see that continue to improve as we head into \u201817, but as I said we now see the point that which we get back to year-over-year positive number pushing out into \u201818. And so, I would expect us to have continued to a very strong margins in the wireless business but is going to be half of that service revenue trajectory continuing to be slightly negative though in an improving direction.", "John Hodulik", "Did you think on a net basis you can keep those wires margins flattish?", "Matt Ellis", "We will continue to aim to produce strong margin in that business and certainly believe that we have the ability to maintain a premium pricing in the market and we will, that will certainly be our aim as we go through the year.", "John Hodulik", "Great. Thank Mike.", "Michael Stefanski", "All right, thanks John. Tori next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch, please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden", "Hey guys thanks for taking the questions. I guess two if I could, first Matt, lot of focus on the guidance taking maybe $2 billion to $3 billion of revenue out of that number. It feels like something has changed on the ground competitively that\u2019s making you have to really get more aggressive on the EIP side and then the promotional side. Do you feel like Verizon needs to go to market more aggressively with an unlimited product like each of your competitors have and as kind of leading with these days and if you could kind of talk about kind of your view we all knew Fran\u2019s view on the economics of that but I look to kind of hear what your perspective is on the necessity that you do that and your ability to do that if you chose to?", "And then the second thing just now with G price elevation to the chair I think we have greater clarity on the likelihood that we are going to be getting rid of the privacy rules specifically in the telecom also the opportunity to maybe more aggressively monetize broadband. Could you talk a little bit about some of the opportunities and actions that you might be taking right now to prefer kind of the next regulatory wave? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. Thank you, David. So I will start with your first question. So as we look at our market position it's based off the product offering and we have the best network performance out there which is a major criteria in the user experience. Despite the claims of others third parties studies continues to demonstrate the superiority of our network and as network leadership position, I will say allows us to maintain a premium price round service in the marketplace. So as I look at our service revenues plus installment billing so the total amount we are actually billing a customer each month I think increased 2% in 2016. So that demonstrates how often it continue to be competitive and resonate in the marketplace. We continue to constantly monitor the competitive market. We look for opportunities to compete more effectively. And as an example of that we have recently launched new single line pricing which we believe was an under-penetrated market for us.", "So our pricing is disciplined to provide a return for our premium service. This number of different offers out there, we saw some folks go to unlimited. We saw some bundling of content and so on in the marketplace. We continue to assess where we are in there and so I will say I think our result we had 167,000 net phone nets in the quarter so I believe our positioning continues to be competitive. We constantly look as well out there. There is unlimited is one of the things some of our competition has at this point in time. There is not something we feel the need to do but I will say we continually monitor the market and we will see where we are heading in the future.", "In terms of your second question, so look there is a lot of changes going on in DC right now. Obviously yesterday we saw the announcement that as you mentioned G pie and so that may have a number of impacts across the regulatory space but I think it's just too soon to tell exactly where we are going to be. We look forward to working with the regulators for the CFCC or others. The other thing I would mention though you think about that we make investments for many years given the nature of the business that we are in. and our investment are focused on just who happens to be in office today. We make an investments so that for 10 plus years and I think our records stands for itself irrespective whoever the administration is run by and the regulatory regime they were effective and that will be continued to be how we focus on our investment. So I will say we look forward to working with the new administration and the new leadership and the FCC and we expect to continue to be competitive in whatever we environment we are operating.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, thank you. Tory, if we can move to next question.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson, please go ahead with your question.", "Craig Moffett", "Thank you. Hi. Good morning guys. So I wanted to sort of step back to a bigger picture question if I could. Matt given the comments that you made in the press release about getting the balance sheet back to the pre-Vodafone deal levels, how much room does that leave you before 2018 and 2019 for strategic transaction. There has been a lot of speculation about the types of things that you might do in this new environment whether it's content, or wire-line or spectrum or none of the above. I wonder if you can just sort of give us some thoughts on how much flexibility you have and how you think about the various factors of opportunity for you?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. Thanks Craig. So as you mentioned that we have been on this path to getting back to the pre-Vodafone credit metrics by 2018-19 and that's part of our overall camp allocation, we have been able to be consistent with investing in our networks on a continuous basis, making that improvement in the balance sheet and also returning value to shareholders and since the Vodafone transaction we had a number of activities that we have done whether that be AOL some of the other acquisitions in IOT such as Fleetmatics, we have also divested of business whether it would be the tower transaction as an example. And so we have been able to continually make strategic transactions while staying consistent to each part of that cap allocation policy. So that would be our intent to continue to do so. And as we head into 2017 we believe that we will out of the two, while continue to maintain that cap allocation policy that allows us to deliver on all three of those key areas.", "Craig Moffett", "And Matt can you comment on how you think about the various options out there whether it's content or wire-line or spectrum or something else?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. So obviously look I am not going to comment on any specific combinations that have been rumored over the years and certainly I am - we are not able to talk specifically about spectrum right now given that we are in the incentive auctions. So we will continue to look for to opportunities to expand and grow the business. Although we\u2019re not completely aligned that we will be disciplined in any investment activity. We evaluate all options whether that's build by our partner for our strategic positioning and the key criteria is creating long term value for the business and shareholders. So we will continue to look for the right things to do to position the business to be successful in the future and that's we do that on an everyday basis and we will continue to do so. And I think we have successfully done that over the past few years.", "Craig Moffett", "Thanks Matt.", "Michael Stefanski", "Our next question please Tory.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup, please go ahead with your question.", "Michael Rollins", "Hi, thanks and good morning. Two if I could. First if you could talk about how the 5G business case is progressing from the financial perspective and Matt what are the key metrics that you are looking for from the key that's working on business case to facilitate a green light of commercial deployment?", "Is there certain cost metrics like per home path or certain other metrics that you are focused on and then just if you could follow up on a clarification? So I think you mentioned that in terms of thinking about flat organic revenue for 2017 you took the revenue for 2016\u2019s tracked divestiture of market to frontier and you subtracted AOL. Can you help us think through what the backs have been on for the 2017 with the number of pending and completed acquisitions that you announced and are still in progress? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. Thanks Mike so let me start up with 5G, so look we had a good progress in 2016 as we discussed throughout the year. We had a number of technical trials and labs go trials which we completed and so we have now moved on to the next phase of that which is some of these commercial scale pilots that are getting on the way right now in about ten different locations around the country. So we are very excited about the opportunities of 5G brings. And we will see how those trials go and we look forward to sharing progress with you on those as we move forward throughout the year.", "You asked around key metrics and I think it's going to be the same as any major investment we could be looking at is the combination of what's the cost of rollout 5G, we get into questions about how the distance from the node, how many homes can you cover many particular node, what speeds can we get, what\u2019s the cost of putting that there etcetera. Etcetera. XO obviously brings something to that but having additional five to the basis we think about rolling out the infrastructure needed for the 5G and but it's the same as any investment Mike we are going to look at the revenue opportunity. We think we can get based off the results of the tests around the way right now. And compare that with the cost. And if it provides a great return for shareholders we will certainly move ahead with launching commercially and if it will be the same as any other investment. We will look at the same way.", "In terms of your second question on 2016 you are right. The base line is reducing the frontier divestiture and also AOL because Sony had partially part of the year in 2015. So then if you think about total revenue for 2017 it would include obviously the full year of AOL this year. We expect XO to kick in later this quarter. We expect the IOT business as you are going to have the full year of Fleetmatics in Telogis and the other IOT acquisitions and then assuming the Yahoo transaction closes we will have the revenue from there too. So when you think about building on the number that Mike mentioned the 121 billion you got all those things to layer on top of that to get to the expectation for the full year. Obviously it relates to pending transactions. It will be contingent on the timing of those as well. But hopefully that answers your questions on that.", "Michael Rollins", "Thanks very much.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay. Tory next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking the question. If I look at your CapEx guidance for the full year, essentially seems you are guiding to flat to plus or minus a reasonable range. So maybe you can maybe unpack that a little bit and just thinking about your network strategy and your product strategy what areas are you accelerating capital investment inside the business and maybe where do you feel like you have done a good job building our your network where it needs to be? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. Thanks Brett, so as you think about the CapEx as you say the number is reasonable consistent year after year and that's something you have seen for a number of years but as you say within that it changes overtime. And so within LTE our spending has continued to transition from coverage to indentifying the network and that continues to evolve as we leverage new technologies around radio and hardware and software and then reforming our spectrum within 4G and identifying with small cells. So you will continue to see that densification of the 4G network and that includes how we put fiber out there which obviously is needed for the 4G network but also it's something we think about for pre-positioning for 5G so you will continue to see that - you will continue to see us launch additional pods of LTE advances as we go through that. We had the initial launch that last year. We expect additional features to come through in the close of this year. And we will continue to expand our architecture. So within wireless you should expect to see the spending continue to move to make the network more efficient on a cost per gig basis going forward.", "And as we have mentioned fiber is a consistent part of our business. So that's something you should expect to see us continuing. We have talked about what we are doing in Boston. You should continue to see us do that. Some of the other businesses aren't as we said previously they are not as capital intensive as our network business. So you should expect to see the CapEx will continue to be focused on the network side of the business as we go into 2017.", "Brett Feldman", "And just a quick question as a follow up around where you are investing you talked about the pre-commercial 5G commercial trials you\u2019re running. Are these predominately within your wire-line footprint or do you actually think that when you are ready to go commercial you have a business case to go in whatever market so quick they have the best demographics regardless of whether you are an incumbent wire-line provider or not.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. It's not just in the wire-line footprint it's across the country and we certainly see the opportunity to deploy 5G solutions across the country as well once we get comfortable that they are ready to be launched out on a commercial basis.", "Brett Feldman", "So you could do one fiber as in market across the country not just in Boston?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes that's certainly we are looking at how we would support the 5G network across the country both in and outside the ILX footprint.", "Brett Feldman", "All right. Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Tory next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies, please go ahead with your question.", "Michael McCormack", "Hey guys, thanks. Matt, maybe just a clarification on your comments regarding service revenue turning positive. Just give us a sense obviously optimization continues but is that predicated stable pricing environment in your view. Secondly, on the retention side it looks like you have got about 21% Delta between those that are on sub-side plans versus those making device payments. Is that fair and as I think about that how much of that is bring your own devices versus off-contract versus your own retention efforts? And then if you don't mind a final one based on our math it looks like you still have about 13.1ish million feature phones out there so non-smart phones what\u2019s the strategy to try to move those over to smart phones or try to retain them to prevent headwinds on handset as we look in the 2017?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. Thanks Mike, I will start with the last one, look we certainly like it when customers migrate from feature phones to an LTE smart phone but we are also very happy for those customers that just want a feature phone. They are not looking for the additional functionality but they want to be connected to a great network. We are very happy to continue to have those as customers and we look forward to continue to have offerings that meet their needs as well.", "In terms of service revenue and I think you talked about the gap between the 46% of our customers who have a device payment plan in the 67% of our base who are now on subsidize pricing. That's a factor of those customers come out they are two year service contracts and they move over to that pricing without necessarily upgrading a handset and we expect that will continue. That delta between those two numbers will be those customers who have either come out of two year subsidy and moved over to the un-subsidized pricing. They could be we now have customers who took out a device payment plan over two years ago who have completed those payments and are now no longer making a device payment every month and as you say BYOD continues to be part of that base too. So you should expect they will continue to be delta between those two numbers because not everyone on unsubsidized pricing is going to have a current device plan. So we see that continuing as we go into the year and part of that is certainly migrating over to device payment.", "Michael McCormack", "Just a clarification, I guess I am trying to get to how much of that I am sorry to interrupt but the actual percentage that is it you going into actively retain customers that are still on contract to reduce their price point without losing a customer. Is there some component to that as well?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, the vast majority of our two year customers who have gone on to the unsubsidized prices but they've come to the end of that. I mean, we typically its customer has to get through their two year price plan if they're on that two year service contract before they were then being able to come to the unsubsidized pricing.", "When you look at our churn, I think what you're trying to get to is that phone shown it was below 0.9%. And that is not because we're bringing customers on to that pricing before they've moved their thing. Their continued strong churn represents the value out basis and the service they get and the high quality of the network what they have when they're authorizing customer. So, it's only when they come out of their two year contract do they move over to -- have the opportunity to move over to unsubsidized pricing.", "Michael McCormack", "Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And just on the service revenue expectations, is that stable pricing is the expectation there or expecting this sort of promotions if we look at 2017?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. We expect to continue to compete in the marketplace as throughout 2016, we had various promotions throughout the year. I'd expect us to continue to different times of the year, have different promotions out there. But I expect base of that, we will compete effectively in the marketplace.", "Michael McCormack", "Great. Thank you, Matt.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, Mike. Tory, we have time for one more question. So, last question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thanks very much and good morning. Just a quick follow-up on Brett's questions on fiber. Specifically, how should we think about your future fiber needs? It seems like in some contacts you're willing to shed certain assets but have also acquired others and are also working with third party providers. In some cases over building in areas such as Boston. I'm trying to understand is that based in your actions, I'd seen as not all fiber assets are created equal. And so, how do you get to the point we have the right fixed assets in the right locations to support your network vision.", "And a just kind of brief follow-up.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes. So, good morning Amir. Thank you, for that. Yes, fiber is going to be a critical asset for us. It's a critical asset today and it will certainly continue to be selling as we go into the future. So, one thing it allows us to do and is certainly is within our footprint is it replaces the core copper networks that have served us well over the year. But from a capability standpoint, or now it's just a maintenance standpoint, it certainly makes a lot of sense for us to continue to replace copper with fiber.", "And then as you say fiber is going to be critical for us as we densify 40 and think about 5G, that it explains why the XO transaction was interesting to us getting those metro rings in 45 of the top 50 markets. The other thing you seen us doing in Boston was really look at this one fiber approach which was built in a network in a way that it provides a common fiber infrastructure to serve a number of different needs, whether that be consumers in home or in out of home and then obviously our small medium and enterprise customers too.", "So, you should continue to see us deploy fiber. How we deploy that fiber? Can differ from location to location. We certainly look where it makes sense for us to own the fiber, but if there's way for us to partner with other people, they can build the fiber on our half, we certainly do that as well. So, it a location-by-location, case-by-case basis, we look at the economics and we decide the best way to get to the fiber assets. And we need, and we think about that if not justify brands, so we need for what we were doing today, but as we think about the network going out in to the future.", "So, you should continue to see us make investments in fiber as we go forward and position the network to service the business well into the future.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Great. And just a quick follow-up on your 2017 outlook. What type of factors do you take into account on any potential changes for the comparative landscape? In particular, Comcast has highlighted that they expect to launch their WiFi and VNO strategy in the back half of the year, giving you focus who're partnered there, was wondering what you're factoring in with respect to that partnership in terms of size and impact of both your financials and potentially the competitive landscape.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, so as I think about, look we know they said they're going to they expect to launch that later in the year. We'll have to wait to see what is. As we said previously, look, we've been in the wholesale business for many years. We're happy to be in that business and we'd sign that agreement again if the opportunity came up. But look we don\u2019t expect that to necessarily have a major impact during the course of 2017. They got a lot of work to do there and I'll let them talk about this strategy on that.", "But as I thi8nk about the competitive environment as a whole, I would expect to continue to evolve in ways that some of which we may guess, others which we'll have to wait and see how they play out, but what I would remind you is that we've seen many different competitive environments over the past 15 20 years in wireless and I think the one constant is being is the way that we've always competed effectively, whatever the environments and I highly expect us to do the same thing in 2017.", "Michael Stefanski", "Great. Thank you for your questions. Tory, before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt.", "Matt Ellis", "Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close this session with a few key points. In 2016, we delivered solid results in the competitive environment. We had a quality customers will lead in the industry and network performance and customer retention. We had solid financial results generating cash flow and shareholder return. We are confident in our strategy and priorities led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize daily usage, maintaining a discipline capital allocation model and returning value to our shareholders.", "We are positioning the company for longtime growth. A key foundational element for our vision of the future is be the trusted network provider. Our strong network assets will enable us to be a centerpiece of this new connected world of people and things and give us the opportunity to participate globally and at advancing digital ecosystems. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us to create value for our customers and shareholders.", "Thank you for your - time today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, Junis. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information and the presentation slides, are available on the Investor Relations Web site. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our Web site.", "Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our Web site. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Matt goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the first quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of the $0.84 per share on a GAAP basis, which included about $0.02 of earnings pressure, primarily related to recent business acquisitions. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I would like to highlight.", "Our reported first quarter earnings include a pre-tax early debt redemption charge of about $850 million and a non-cash pre-tax gain on a Spectrum License Transaction of roughly $125 million. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $435 million or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.95 in the first quarter compared to $1.06 a year ago.", "Recall that our first quarter 2016 adjusted EPS included $0.10 of earnings related to the three Wireline properties that we sold to Frontier. During the first quarter, we reorganized the customer groups within the Wireline segment. On April 11th, we released unaudited historical results recast for the four customer groups, including Verizon Business Markets, a new group that consist of U.S. based small and medium size businesses, state and local governments and educational institutions.", "This new group was formed to increase the focus on these markets. The historical total segment revenues remain unchanged from previously reported results. As a reminder,. we are still subject to the FCC and inclusion rules relate to the Spectrum auction, so we\u2019ll not be able to answer spectrum related questions.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Matt.", "Matt Ellis", "Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. As outlined in our earnings call in January, our priorities for 2017 are to leverage our network leadership, retain and grow our high-quality customer base while balancing profitability, enhance ecosystems in Media and Telematics, and drive monetization of these networks and solutions. We are executing against these priorities while positioning the business for the long-term as we progress through 2017.", "The first quarter of 2017 proved to be a very active quarter for us; first, we extended our network leadership, as recognized by third party testing results; second, we launched an introductory unlimited wireless data plan to address evolving customers\u2019 demand in a highly competitive environment; third, we realigned our operating themes to enable business agility to deliver new products and next generation services.", "Verizon's core strength and the foundation of our future success in a connected world starts with the network, and we have enhanced our track record of U.S. industry leadership. We are consistently investing in our network to extend our leadership in both 4G and 5G. We also closed the acquisition of XO Communications fiber assets in the quarter.", "Our uncompromising commitment to our customers led to the launch of an introductory unlimited offering in the quarter. This measured approach in a competitive and highly penetrated wireless phone environment was positively received by both the consumer market and more importantly, our existing customer base. Our competitive unlimited offer, coupled with networks strength and reliability, allows us to attract, retain and grow high-value customer relationships across our entire business.", "At the end of the first quarter, we announced the realignments of our operating teams to facilitate organizational agility in wireless and fiber markets to scale and expand our Media and Telematics businesses and to maintain leadership in network reliability and new technology. These changes do not affect our segment reporting. We are confident in our strategy and priorities to provide the best network experience in the U.S., create long lasting customer relationships and identify growth opportunities in new businesses. Executing these strategies will enable us to continues to deliver returns on our investments and drive long-term value for our shareholders.", "Let's review the first quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by Wireless and Wireline results, Media and Telematics progress and a network technology update. Now on to slide six. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions in the period, consolidated revenue declined approximately 4.5%. The primary driver was a decrease in wireless service revenue resulting from the migration to the new pricing structures introduced over the past nine months, and the ongoing transition of the base to unsubsidize pricing. These pricing moves have been positively received in the marketplace.", "On a consolidated basis, excluding non-operational items, first quarter adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.3%, which was slightly higher year-over-year due to steady improvement in operating efficiencies and cost management. Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide seven.", "We are generating substantial cash flows from our operating segments. Cash flow from operations is $1.7 billion, which included discretionary pension contributions of $3.4 billion. Additionally, our ongoing asset-back securitization program provided $1.3 billion in the quarter, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The discretionary pension contributions are net present value positive on an asset tax basis given the reduction in our variable rate PBGC premiums and the expected net return on planned assets.", "As a result of these contributions, our mandatory pension funding through 2020 is expected to be minimal, which will benefit future cash flows and improve the funded status at our qualified pension plan. Also, the rating agencies view debt funded pension contributions as neutral to credit rating metrics.", "Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we are investing in our networks. Our capital expenditures were $3.1 billion in the quarter, and we expect capital spending for the year to be within our 2017 guided range. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $116.5 billion of total debt, which was comprised of $110.2 billion of unsecured debt and $6.3 billion of on balance sheet securitizations.", "During the quarter, we completed multiple capital market transactions, including new debt issuances to fund the discretionary pension contributions, the acquisition of XO and to pre-fund the acquisition of Yahoo. These transactions included a $3.1 billion tender offer and $9 billion debt exchange, which reduced future cash interest costs and extended maturities. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.", "Now, let's move into review to the operating segments, starting with Wireless and the impacts of Unlimited on slide eight. In our Wireless business, we have extended our network leadership position, while balancing operational performance in a competitive environment. Verizon is the U.S. market leader across high-value postpaid phone customers, and we have consistently stated that our top priority is protecting our base to build on our customer relationships into the future.", "During the first quarter, we made a disciplined decision to launch an unlimited offering, so let's spend a few minutes on the factors leading to our decision. As discussed on the last earnings call, we launched wireless plans in mid-2016 that offered safety mode and carry over data, reducing overage charges. Since the launch, the U.S. wireless phone market experienced greater competition with unlimited plans from other carriers. We chose to compete using equipment promotions during that time, while we evaluated different service pricing options, including Unlimited. At the start of 2017, competitive intensity escalated, resulted in loss of gross add share and an uptick in churn pressure. So we determine that the timing was right for the introduction of an unlimited option at the high-end of our existing plans.", "We are confident in our network capability to efficiently manage the expected usage growth from unlimited, because we have invested in technology, architecture and densification. Our early network performance is consistent with our high-quality of service expectations and within the current network plan. The customer response to the launch was favorable as evidenced by an immediate improvement in subscribe activity in the second half of the quarter.", "In the quarter, in which we added 49,000 smartphones, our phone net-adds had two distinct trajectories. Prior to our Unlimited launch, we had retail postpaid phone net losses of 398,000 customers. After the launch, we added 109,000 retail postpaid phone customers, which gives us momentum entering the second quarter. Overall in the first quarter, we lost 307,000 postpaid customers, consisting of phone losses of 289,000 and tablet losses of 255,000 offset by other connected devices.", "We introduced the Unlimited offering, primarily to protect our high quality base, and we achieved the desired impact as retail phone churn improved after the launch and was less than 0.9% for the eighth consecutive quarter despite heights and competition in the marketplace. Total retail postpaid churn of 1.15% increased year-over-year due to higher tablet churn, which is expected to remain elevated throughout the year as customers roll-off for free capital promotions from prior years.", "Total postpaid device activations were down almost 9% over the year prior, of which about 82% were phones. In a seasonally soft quarter, we had 5.2% of our retail postpaid base upgrade to a new device, down from 5.8% last year. During the quarter, 5.7 million phones were activated on device payment plans. While we may progress in the prepaid market, this remains an area of opportunity for us, as prepaid devices declined by 17,000 in the quarter as compared to a decline of 177,000 in the prior year.", "Let's turn to slide nine and take a closer look at Wireless revenue and profitability. Total Wireless operating revenue declined 5.1% in the first quarter. We experienced the change in the service revenue trend, which had been improving sequentially. Service revenue declined 6.1% year-over-year compared to the 4.9% decrease in the previous quarter. The service revenue pressure was a result of decreased overage revenue, lower postpaid customers in the quarter and promotional activity. Overage pressure was primarily related to the ongoing migration to the pricing plans implemented last year and the introduction of Unlimited offerings.", "As expected, optimize as we benefit the most from stepping down in price, primarily single line users, were the early adopters of these plans. We believe this revenue trend will persist through the first half of the year, but remain confident that these plans will be up and neutral over-time as more users step-up in price, which has already taken place. New customer accounts added after the unlimited launch on average had higher account access fees. While we absorb overages in the near-term, we expect that the increase in account access fees will replace overages overtime.", "Equipment revenue decreased 4.8% in the first quarter. Sequentially, the percentage of phone activations on device payment plans remain steady at approximately 76% in the first quarter compared with about 77% in the fourth quarter. We expect the second quarter device payment plan take rate to remain consistent.", "At the end of the quarter, approximately 48% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan, while about 71% were in unsubsidized pricing. Our Wireless EBITDA margin, as a percent of total revenue, was 45.1% which was down due to the service revenue trend and the increased advertising activity associated with the unlimited plan launch.", "Let's move next to our Wireline segment on slide 10. At the beginning of February, we completed the acquisition of XO Communications which contributed revenue to enterprise solutions, partner solutions and business markets for about half of the quarter. Excluding XO, Wireline segment revenues maintained recent trends, declining 3.2%. Consumer markets revenue increased 0.7%, which was driven by favorable pricing, partially offset by lower customer demand.", "In Fios Internet, we added 35,000 customers for the quarter, over 22% of our broadband customers are in plans with speeds of 100 megabits per second or more. Fios video losses of 13,000 in the quarter were indicative of softer demand from linear video due to the increase in over-the-top offerings, mobile video consumption and competitive promotional offers, particularly in the New York market.", "On an organic basis, Enterprise Solutions revenue declined 4.3% in the quarter as a result of pricing pressure in the market. On a constant currency basis, this decline was 3.7%. The customer migration from legacy services, such as voice, to advanced communications product is generating a revenue headwind in the near term, while increasing customer satisfaction and decreasing serving cost over the long term.", "Wireline segment EBITDA margin increased to 22.7% for the quarter, up from 19% last year. Tight cost controls plus impact of last year's renegotiated labor contracts improved profitability. We expect full year improvements in margins with seasonal fluctuations throughout the year.", "Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss their progress in new businesses. In our Media business, AOL continues to deliver solid seasonal performance with growth in gross revenue. Revenue, net of traffic acquisition costs, decreased about 4% driven by a higher percentage of programmatic advertising. Along with our content assets, AOL\u2019s ADTECH capabilities have enabled us to provide unique content across multiple platforms.", "We have assembled video platforms to leverage the growing customer demand for digital media. Our targeted content pillars, focusing on news, sports, finance and lifestyle, are already increasing the viewership. To provide the necessary scale to effectively leverage these assets, we are looking forward to combining AOL and Yahoo and operate in the combined businesses under the Oath brand. We are actively working on integration streams with Yahoo to ensure a smooth consolidation when the transaction closes, which is expected during the second quarter.", "Consistent with past quarters, digital video consumption on the go90 app maintained in average data usage of about 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% to the up-traffic served on the Verizon wireless network. During the quarter, the app was updated to improve the user interface, increase content discovery and enhance the programming and advertising capabilities.", "In the Telematics business, we are quickly integrating the Fleetmatics and Telogis acquisitions. With these assets, we are the global market share leader and are looking to expand our offerings in this space. Total Telematics revenue was $214 million in the first quarter. Organically, IoT revenue, including Telematics, was up approximately 17% in the first quarter.", "Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our networks to ensure that overall quality and capacity remains ahead of demand. Capital spending of $3.1 billion in the quarter was largely network related to maintain leadership in our markets. Fiber is a critical component of our network strategy and next generation deployments, as demonstrated by the success of our densification initiative. Earlier this week, we announced the strategic agreement with Corning with whom we have a long-relationship to supply optical fiber and hardware solutions of at least $1.05 billion from 2018 to 2020. This investment ensures that we have adequate supply of fiber.", "In the first quarter, LTE data traffic increased 57% over the prior-year. While still early in the cycle, the increased data traffic resulting from Unlimited is in line with our expectations, and network management tools have been effective. We are committed to remain in the largest and most reliable 4G network through technological developments in LTE, deploying small cells and refarming mid-band spectrum. As part of the densification, we are deepening our fiber assets, enhanced by the XO transaction. As previously announced, we are launching 11 pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless pilots during the second quarter and we look forward to sharing the results later in the year.", "Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. Our long-term growth model is to lead in network, expand our customer relationships and develop new businesses in Media and Telematics. While executing on our strategy and positioning for future growth, in the quarter, we listen to our customers evaluated the marketplace and launched an unlimited offering in order to retain and grow our high quality customer relationships.", "We realigned our operating teams to increase business agility to deliver new products and next generation services and develop new ecosystems in Media and Telematics in order to monetize the rising data traffic on our network. Overall, we are confident in our strategy and ability to execute and deliver long-term value to our customers, partners and shareholders.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you, Matt. Junis, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman", "Matt, you were talking about fiber, and during his Media appearances this week, Lowell noted that the Company does in fact have a pretty strong interest in adding more fiber to the network. And you've indicated that this could potentially be achieved through M&A. And when noting that hwsaid, yes, there\u2019s never really a perfect fit in terms of architecture. So my question is, what type of architecture are you looking to add to the network that you have today? And is it reasonable to assume that the choice you have to make, if you either do this organically through higher levels of capital investment or to do it inorganically through acquisitions, which could potentially result in the Company operating at higher leverage for longer than we have expected? Thank you.", "Matt Ellis", "So I think if you look at what Lowell said earlier in the week, as we look at the network and is consistent with all being saying for over a year ago, since we announced the fiber initiative in Boston, that as we look at the networks of the future, they are going to be built with a lot of fiber deep into the network and that network is going to be built for multiuse cases, not for a single use case; so it's going to deliver consumer to the home applications; it's going to deliver small business applications; it's going to light up enterprise buildings; and it's also going to deliver smart cities and IoT solutions too.", "So as we think about how you build that network out, you\u2019re going to need fiber that\u2019s not out there today, which is one of the reasons we had the announcement earlier this week to make sure that we have access to the physical fiber as we start to deploy it more in places like Boston around the country. Now as you say, the architecture doesn\u2019t exist today in terms of what we could acquire. So there is options here, we can go out we could build that fiber as we\u2019re doing in Boston. And we also look at every way that we get access to that fiber. That\u2019s what it\u2019s critically about, is getting access to the fiber we need to deliver the solutions that we\u2019re looking to do. And there\u2019s multiple ways we can get that.", "So depending on the location that may mean us building the fiber network. If there is great assets already in place and as the opportunity to acquire them at a good price then we would certainly look to do that. And then there is also other ways to work with partners thhrough leasing and other arrangements where we don\u2019t have to build or outright buy. So we will look at all those opportunities as how we get access to that fiber, do we need to build the network of the future and provide the solutions that our customers are going to want as we go forward.", "So as you say, we could do that organically and inorganically. We\u2019re very comfortable and confident in the assets we have and adding on to them ourselves. But if the right opportunity came along, we would look at that. And I think we\u2019ve been fairly consistent about dealing that and we\u2019ve also been consistent about the impact on the balance sheet. We believe in a strong balance sheet. But if the right acquisition comes along that allows us to add shareholder values in the long run and it\u2019s the right thing for shareholders and all stakeholders in our business, we would look doing that. But we\u2019d do it in a way that certainly reflected the need to have a strong balance sheet.", "Brett Feldman", "And just quick follow up. Is it fair to assume that if the choice was do it organically, it does require higher levels of capital investment? Because if the answer is no then I guess the follow up to that one would be, what would ultimately make an acquisition attractive, is it really just speed to market?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, there is a number of different assets, aspects to it that would make it attractive; speed to market; the quality of the assets, that\u2019s there; and we look at all those things. But ultimately, if we have to build it ourselves, we\u2019re comfortable doing so. And we think we can do that relatively within our investment plans.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Rollins", "Two if I could, one of the net add disclosure around the over 100,000 net adds since the launch of Unlimited. Given the seasonality that exist in the first quarter, can you compare that to year-ago period and give us a sense of how net adds performed since Unlimited, relative to what it was last year over the same timeframe? And then secondly, as you look at building small cells, I was wondering if you could put the fiber deal into context in terms of how many small cell that could give Verizon, and then how long does it take to build that? I know it\u2019s a three year deal that got announced. But what's the pace that investors should be thinking about in terms of how many small cells Verizon can deploy in a 12-month period? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "So I'll start with your first one. We really don\u2019t breakout the quarter typically in terms of the net add numbers, and so. But when you look at year-over-year, what you\u2019re really looking at here is the impact of going to the unlimited. And really given our customers, the functionality that they are looking for and that was a decision we made, and you saw an immediate impact in our business. And we certainly do look at that the month-by-month. And I can tell you that this isn\u2019t a seasonality in the first quarter, the change we saw in the first quarter. But really the 398,000 negative number through the first half and in the positive 109 in the second half, was all about the response to Unlimited as opposed to any significant seasonality in the quarter.", "And then in terms of your second question on small cells, so the fiber deal isn\u2019t just about building small cells. Obviously, we will build small cells with this, but there would be other use cases as we go out. So we\u2019re not in a position today that to say the number of small cells that we will light up with this fiber agreement with Corning. I can tell you, we will continue to build the best performing wireless network across the country; and we use small cells, we use the new technologies in LTE; and moving into 5G to do that and this fiber will help us to do that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik", "Matt, just a couple of questions on for the financials, first on the wireless side. The postpaid was down 5.8%, definitely a change in trend as you mentioned. You talked about the impact Unlimited had and the fact that it being that move happening mid-quarter. Should we expect that trend to worsen from here, or do you think you've gotten most of the -- it's been down out of the way? And then secondly in terms of the guidance, you kept the guidance for the year that you had despite revenues being down 4.5% and earnings being down by 10%. Could you talk a little bit about some of the drivers to getting back to flat on both of those metrics for the year? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "So I\u2019ll start with your first one around wireless revenues and the ARPA decline. So as I look through the quarter, and let's see what happened in the wireless revenues. We have the continuation of the migration of the base to unsubsidized pricing. But in addition to that, what we also saw was a reduction in overage revenues. And this really was as much about the continuation of people migrating to the plans we launched last summer with safety mode and roll over data as it was about Unlimited. We've seen a good amounts of our base already roll-over to those plans where the overage starts to decline.", "And as we go forward, we should expect to see that continue in the second quarter and then we expect we\u2019ll see the trend in wireless service revenue starts to improve in the second half of the year. So we do think you'll see another quarter of some pressure in wireless ARPA before we see it head-up again. And look the other piece that\u2019s in the wireless number is when we were down close to 400,000 net adds in the first part of the quarter that's -- those were revenues that we didn\u2019t bare on the second half of the quarter but we saw the reverse in those trends and look forward to that piece continuing.", "So on the guide, if I go back to the guide real quickie here, what we said is on organic basis we\u2019ll be fairly consistent. So when you look at the first quarter, a year ago was $1.06 and that included about $0.10 from the assets we sold to Frontier. This year, we had $0.95 and as Mike mentioned, there was about $0.02 of pressure in there from the acquisition. So I think we\u2019re in line there. From a revenue standpoint, they\u2019re down 4.5% from an organic basis year-over-year. As I said, the service revenue we expect to improve and the trajectory in the second half of the year.", "The big thing around the revenue for the year is going to be equipment revenue. And as we\u2019ve gone through the unsubsidized pricing, we recognized that equipment revenue at the time of the activation of handset; we\u2019ll see what happens in the back half of the year; we\u2019ll see the new devices that come to market; we\u2019ll see how the holiday season goes, and that will be a key driver of getting to that revenue target.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery", "I wonder, Matt, if you could just talk a little bit more believe capital spending for the year; you\u2019ve obviously talked a about densification support, but what range is quite wide; you reiterated that today wireless was quite like this quarter. And so how should we think about mid range low end, high end and the trajectory through the year? And we were certainly getting a lot of questions about your Corning deal, $1 billion is a big contract. But I think Lowell was making the point that that\u2019s consistent with your overall capital spending needs. So is this something where it\u2019s consistent with spending or expecting, or have been doing and continue to do? Or is this a real step up in your fiber spending? Thank you.", "Matt Ellis", "So on the last question, the Corning deal. And as you say $1 billion over three years, it\u2019s certainly not a small number. But when you look within the overall context of our capital spend, it certainly fits in there. So as we go and build out fiber assets, I think you\u2019ll see us do that within our total capital spend. Yes, you will see us spend more on fiber as we go forward. But historically, you\u2019ve seen moves within our capital spend between different components. So this increase in the fiber spend will be offset by reductions in other areas, and that\u2019s the trend you\u2019re seeing consistently for us.", "In terms of capital spend for the year, the first quarter was certainly a lower quarter and we sometime see. But the first quarter is often a low capital spend quarter for us. So that\u2019s about where we expected it to come in. In terms of the guide for the year, it's too early in the year to say exactly we will be in that range, I am confident we\u2019ll be in that range. And as we go through the year, we\u2019ll provide more insights into where we think we\u2019ll end up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden", "I guess a couple if I could. Just first one, could you be more specific with respect to exactly what XO Communications contributed in revenue and EBITDA terms to the Wireline businesses for the two months that it did in the quarter? And then also Matt it looks like taxes were actually a source of cash this quarter, but we are expecting cash tax outflows for the year. Could you elaborate a little bit on that? And then lastly, just a housekeeping question, I guess based on the comments you made about exit rate for subscriber additions in 1Q. Should we be extrapolating that run rate performance into 2Q and rest of the year? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "So on XO Communication, I wouuld say, you'd see nominal impact at the earnings level from the transaction in the course of the quarter. Your question around cash taxes, what you\u2019re seeing there is that you say, first quarter is typically live from a cash taxes standpoint, just because of the timing of when payments are due. As you go through the year, previously we had said the cash taxes would converge closely with the ETR rate. Because of some of the activity we had in the quarter with the discretionary pension contribution and the liability management activity, with cash taxes we\u2019re now actually come-in in a lower rate than the ETR for the year. So that's an improvement to the cash expectation for the year.", "From an exit rate of the first quarter, it\u2019s too soon to say just purely extrapolate that number out. But certainly, we\u2019re very confident that the offering is resonated very strongly with the base; both in terms of improvements in churn and also an uptick in growth that, we continue to see that; the rest of the quarter will play out based off of new devices that hit the market; and then also the competitive response, especially as we head into Mother's Day and the Dads and Grads period in June. But we do look forward to a better trajectory from the business with an offer out there that\u2019s certainly resonating with customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick", "One sort of short-one and maybe one longer; first, churn in handsets remains below 0.9%. But it sort of looks like it was up a lot year-over-year, or was the problem in the first six weeks of the year much more gross-add driven and not really a churn problem; and then second, and it sounds like Lowell was not on. But I thought the CNBC interview went really well and explain the fiber densification in 5G plan. But where his Bloomberg comments really, they were confusing, and I think they confused a lot of investors. Were they misconstrued, or did he really open the door on deals like this Disney, CBS and Comcast? And if so, what's changed since he clearly shot down speculation of interest in CBS in December? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "So on the churn question, I think it's, as you say, the first half of the quarter we did see an uptick in churn and then we saw it come back down in the second half with the response to Unlimited. Look, we had a lot of customers in the base who love being on the Verizon network and the performance they get. But certainly managing their data was a pain point, it was another thing to do within their lives. And so they was some interest from the Unlimited functionality and as other people are offering that, we saw some people choose to make that trade off between quality of network, but not having to manage their data.", "And so as soon as we went to the Unlimited offering and we gave people the option of not having to make a trade-off, they could have unlimited data and beyond the best network we saw an immediate improvement in the churn number where our base saying this is where we want to be. And we\u2019re certainly seeing that continue as we head into the second quarter.", "Now your second question, so okay, there is obviously been a lot over the past 24-hours around this, so let's break this down. Lowell was asked a question in an interview about if a certain company called and wanted to talk, would he take that meeting. And he responded, sure we\u2019d take that meeting. And if emphasis he added on just like if a couple of other companies called, we\u2019d take the same meeting. What this really comes down to and is consistent with what he said on CNBC interview was, we\u2019re looking to how we execute our strategy; we\u2019re confident in executing our strategy organically. But if there is the right opportunity out there to accelerate the strategy inorganically in a way that adds shareholder value, we\u2019re always looking at those opportunities.", "But I think the story was a little taken out in context, he was answering a question about, if somebody called would we take a call and would we have a conversation with them. Of course, we would. But we\u2019re also very confident with the assets we have and the plans we have of developing the business in an organic fashion as well and generating shareholder value.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.", "Craig Moffett", "So I know you\u2019re going to get tired of trying to be asked all the same questions the same way. But if I take your, the big answer that you just gave, describing the situation with respect to M&A. Is that to say that the status quo of your network densification strategy, do you view that as a sufficient solution then? And do you have confidence that that leads Verizon to a network superiority position? And then lastly, if you could just comment on, you talked about the momentum into the second quarter. Could you comment on whether you think the dynamics of the -- as we enter the second quarter, are actually a bit better, spread has moved off of it, some of its most aggressive promotions? Do you think that the competitive intensity has moderated even a little bit, or are we still in that same bad cycle that we were in Q1?", "Matt Ellis", "So I'll take your first question then. But you mentioned, made a comment there Craig about re-lead in networks superiority, that would imply that at some point we didn\u2019t -- we have given up the lead in network superiority, and that clearly hasn\u2019t happened. You can look at any of the third party results of the testing they do over the past year, and you can see if anything we\u2019ve widen the lead. So network superiority will continue to be at the forefront of what we do. We\u2019re very confident that the customers value that. And we\u2019re very confident that we will lead as we move into 5G; we\u2019ll have that network out there first; have customer offering around that technology out there first; and that will give us an opportunity to work to continue to expand the business, just like we have with previous generations of technology.", "In terms of your dynamics in the second quarter in the marketplace, look we will have to wait and see. Right now, we\u2019re very happy with how the customer base is responding to the offers that we have out there. We\u2019ll have to see what the competition does. And we will continue to be competitive in the marketplace, but we will do that in a disciplined fashion. And we\u2019ll see other quarter plays out.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer Fritzsche", "Just on the follow up question that network superiority, that\u2019s true every third party report seems to have Verizon by a widely ahead, but which leads to the question about spectrum. I realized you can't comment on the most recent auction. But can you just talk, Matt in general, how comfortable you are with your spectrum position as you sit now? And then four of the 11 markets, can you comment on what spectrum you\u2019ll be using for that last mile of the 5G?", "Matt Ellis", "So for the 5G trials that we\u2019re doing, we're using the 28 gigahertz spectrum that we have the right to use as part of the arrangement we have with XO. In terms of your broader question about our spectrum position, we\u2019re very confident in it. Approximately 50% of our current spectrum holdings are delivering our 5G network today, so we have significant opportunity to -- about 4G usages there. We have significant opportunities to continue to grow within the spectrum holdings that we currently have; we\u2019re refarming spectrum as we've talked about for a while; we still have the AWS-3 spectrum; and then on license, we\u2019ll come into the portfolio we go forward to.", "In addition to using spectrum though, the way the spectrum is used continues to get more efficient based off of the network architecture and advancements in the technology; LTE advance we've talked a lot about, they continues to be additions to that. And so as we look forward, we\u2019re very confident that we have the spectrum we need to continue to deliver the best-in-class 4G experience.", "Jennifer Fritzsche", "And Matt, if I may, just one quick follow-up. So nothing you've seen since late February with the usage that's come from Unlimited. It seems like that nothing has changed in terms of the need for more spectrum, its just so be consistent with what your prior comments were.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, we obviously saw an uptick in usage, but it was expected. One of the reasons we waited until February to launch Unlimited was we said to oursevels if we're ever going to do Unlimited, we are not going to do it at the expense of the core brand promise, which is the network performance. And so we spend a lot of time in the back half of last year, asking ourselves is the network ready for Unlimited. We did a lot of testing around the network. And so we concluded that the network was ready for that.", "What we've seen since we launched from a usage standpoint and it's been in line with our expectations. The other important thing of course is when we launched it, we gave ourselves the opportunity to network manage when a user goes pass 22 gigs, and so that's an important point in managing the network in an unlimited world. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with the experience we've seen so far.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike McCormack", "Matt, just maybe a comment on the margin trade-off of the ARPA changes that we've seen lot of promotional activity, and you guys have done some yourself there, that sort of versus the lower volumes that we're seeing out there. And I guess just trying to get a sense for whether or not wireless margins have seen their peak, if you will. And then with respect to the sub losses, Unlimited obviously had a positive impact. But it just seems like network quality is no longer resonating with consumers. I'm just trying to get a sense for how you guys think about differentiating against the peers going forward other just the simple rate card?", "Matt Ellis", "So on your last comment around network quality resonating, I would say that completely disagree with that statement. We know from talking with our customers that network quality matters that they value the quality of our network. The fact that they have the reliability to get on the network and stay on the network work, no matter what they\u2019re doing or where they are, is tremendously important to them. And that shows up in the churn rate that we have coming in below 0.9% three quarters in a row and certainly, the improvement we saw there post launch. So this narrative that network no longer matters, I think we completely disagree with and I think that shows up in the numbers and the results that we show.", "In terms of the margin trade-off I think, look, when you\u2019re looking then to the ARPA decline this is a continuation of decline, because we're breaking apart the service revenue and the handset revenue. When you look at the ARPA number, which is really the billings we give to customer every month that includes the handset billing, that still up year-over-year. So we continue to feel good about that trajectory.", "And as you think about our move to Unlimited, we did it in a way where we will added the functionality but it wasn\u2019t a price reduction. We think that this ARPA will be ARPA neutral overtime. We\u2019ll initially seize the impact of optimizes and we\u2019ll also see the impact of reduced overage. But we also have the ability for customers to come on the network on a metered plan and then step up overtime, and even our base is stepping up from some of the lower data buckets to get on Unlimited. So there is some offsets there that we think means that Unlimited is not going to be a reduction in ARPA. And this is why we say when we introduced it, we did show in a disciplined fashion, which is something you should expect to see from us as we go forward and respond to the marketplace.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Just building upon that last question, when you folks originally introduced your outlook for 2017, there was an expectation for a push out in terms of the recovery or the growth of service revenues. Given where we are today, how should we think about the potential drivers for service revenue growth in future periods? You\u2019d originally called the Unlimited plan, introductory. And I am just trying to think about the different moving factors and where we could see that potential opportunity to drive service revenue growth in future, and then I\u2019ve just got one follow up from here.", "Matt Ellis", "So on the trajectory, we still feel confident that we\u2019ll see an improvement in the wireless trajectory as we go through the year, and a stronger overall result from year-over-year number versus last year. Now, what we will see is in the second quarter we\u2019ll see a continuation of the impact of the optimizations, both through the customers that came onto the Verizon plan last summer and also on Unlimited. But then the back half of the year, we\u2019ll see the trend start to improve and we continue to be confident that we\u2019ll see wireless service revenue get back to positive on a year-over-year basis during 2018.", "So I think the big thing as you look there is we continue to keep pricing at the right levels. We have the opportunity to step customers up. And as we more successful in adding customers in the marketplace, as we showed in the back half of the quarter, that gives us the opportunity to move those trends in the right direction.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "And then one follow up, and to some of the prior commentary you made. You discussed this idea of longer term shareholder value in the event that some opportune inorganic asset comes to market. What parameters do you gauge that shareholder value by? I know you have remained committed to de-levering the balance sheet to those pre-Vodafone levels during the 2018 and 2019 period. I was wondering, is there flexibility around that if the right asset was to present itself, or any color you can provide around that would be most helpful?", "Matt Ellis", "So I think there has been a little surprise by some comments we\u2019ve made over the past few months around this. And really internally, there was no change in how we view this. We certainly have the target to get back to that leverage ratios and credit metrics as we discussed. But we\u2019ve always believed and maybe it's just because we\u2019ve said it more explicitly over the past few months. But look, if you give me two options; option A is, an opportunity comes up and I say no I can't do it because it mean I couldn\u2019t hit that leverage target; or option B is, I do a transaction that allows me to accelerate the strategy of the Company, improve my competitiveness in the marketplace and do it in a fashion that allows me to improve shareholder value versus the first option.", "But it means I have to push out when I get back to those leverage targets, is the right thing to do to do the second option. If it means we push that when we get to those targets because we have a great opportunity, we\u2019re going to do that. There is no change there. But I will say that we continue to be committed to a strong balance sheet, whether or not we have any inorganic activity.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tim Horan", "Matt, it seems like some of your competitors have really been aggressive on splashing OpEx and CapEx, and I know now just had a little bit more time to look at Verizon and what your competitors have done. I guess do you have the ability to do the same thing? And maybe a little color around the reorganization what that kind of mean in terms of expense reductions overtime? Thanks.", "Matt Ellis", "So I would say they have been talking about these reductions in OpEx over the past year or two. I think you\u2019ve heard us talk about it for more years in that now. We continue to look at and manage the cost of the business down, and I think you see that in results. You certainly can see it clearly in the results in the Wireline segment, for example. So we look at managing OpEx and reducing it, not as a program for a year or two but something we do every year. Every year we have cost reduction targets for each of the business units and they diligently work on those and have a great track record of delivering them.", "As I think about CapEx, one of the great things about our business is we produce a significant amount of cash flow that allows us to continue to invest in the business. And we do that so that we position the business to be able to deliver products and offer our customers just for today but as we head into the future, because the nature of the business we\u2019re in, we're always looking at least one to two years out in terms of what we need. So we continue to do that and make sure that we're providing the connectivity solutions that our customers need as we go forward.", "However, saying that, we look at how we get -- continue to get more efficient in there. And you will see us continually do that, the cost to add capacity in the network continues to come down and it comes down because of the things our network team has done for many years and how we work with the vendors in the space. So we don\u2019t make as much of a big deal about what we do to manage OpEx and CapEx efficiencies. But I can absolutely guarantee you it's a key focus within the business and we have a great track record of doing that.", "In terms of the reorganization, I think look, this is just an opportunity to make sure we stay focused on the key things to us, which is the network and continuing to build the network; not just the network of today but the networks we need going forward; the focus on managing the customer base and growing the base, retaining the base and generating loyalty; and then generating those new businesses, whether that be in the Media Co, Telematics or the broad IoT space. So it was really to make sure the organization is aligned with those strategic goals of the Company.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I'd like to turn the call back to Matt for some closing comments.", "Matt Ellis", "Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. The first quarter showed our ability to compete effectively in a financially disciplined manner. We remain confident in our strategy and priorities, led by investing in our networks, creating platforms to further monetize data usage, maintaining a disciplined capital allocation model and creating value for our customers and shareholders. We are positioning the Company for long term growth; a key foundational element of our vision of the future is our strong network assets.", "Our strong networks will enable us to be at the center of this new connected world of people and things, and give us the opportunity to participate globally in the advancing digital ecosystems. We look forward to the tremendous opportunity to leverage all of our assets, and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy. Thank you for your time today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and using Verizon Conference Services.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran goes through our results, I would like to highlight a few items related to our earnings. GAAP reported earnings were $1.02 per share. And there were no special items of a non-operational nature. This compares with adjusted earnings of $0.84 per share in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of 21.4%. As a reminder, the adjusted EPS of $0.84 last year did not reflect a 100% ownership of wireless for the full quarter since the Vodafone transaction closed on February 21, 2014. As we indicated a year ago on a non-GAAP illustrative basis, adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2014 would have been $0.91 per share if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for the full quarter. On this more comparable basis, growth in the first quarter earnings per share was 12.1%.", "I would also like to make a few points about our wireline segment reporting. Our wireline results include the operations we are selling to Frontier until the transaction closes, which is targeted for the first half of 2016. Our consolidated balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities associated with those operations as being held for sale. This is important because accounting rules require that depreciation expense not be recorded on assets held for sale. Therefore, wireline depreciation expense will be lower in 2015 due to the classification of these assets. The first quarter included a $146 million pre-tax benefit, which equates to roughly $0.02 per share. Going forward, until closing, the full quarter benefit will be approximately $200 million pre-tax or $0.03 per share.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. We are off to a strong start in 2015 with an eventful first few months behind us. We continue to execute well on our strategy of investing in networks and platforms and positioning the business for future growth. We delivered very strong financial and operating results in the first quarter with strong cash generation. To review our active start to the year, we were successful in the AWS-3 spectrum auction improving our mid-band spectrum position while maintaining sound financial discipline.", "As we stated on our conference call in mid-February, we are very pleased with the licenses we won and are confident that they will enable us to execute efficiently on our network strategy of adding capacity through a combination of spectrum deployment and small cell technology. Our early experiences with small cell deployments have been very favorable and we believe that the industry is making good progress on standards for utilizing unlicensed spectrum with LTE, which is already being tested in our vendor labs.", "We also executed several value creating transactions that underline our commitment to extend our industry leadership in the markets we serve by being strategically focused and returning value to shareholders. We successfully monetized our tower portfolio in a $5 billion transaction with American Tower, which closed at the end of the first quarter. We signed a definitive agreement to sell our wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California to Frontier for $10.5 billion. And we implemented a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which resulted in an immediate reduction of about 86 million shares in mid-February. Final settlement of this transaction, including delivery of the remaining shares that we expect to receive is scheduled to occur in the second quarter. Collectively, these transactions provide immediate value for shareholders.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to our primary focus which is executing our day to day strategy for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our first quarter results reflect strong top and bottom line performance. We posted solid revenue growth, high quality earnings growth of 12% and generated substantial free cash flow. In wireless, we had a solid quarter of quality connections growth and profitability. We had 565,000 retail postpaid net adds in a seasonally low volume quarter. Total wireless revenue grew 6.9% and EBITDA was up 6.6%. As expected our wireless EBITDA margin returned to more historical levels. In wireline, consumer revenues grew 4% and we continued to increase our FiOS penetration with quality customer growth. Total wireline revenue was impacted by foreign exchange pressure, but our continued focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in EBITDA margin expansion.", "Now let\u2019s get into the first quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 4. Total operating revenue grew 3.8% in the first quarter continuing our consistent top line growth trend. If we excluded the first quarter 2014 revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.2%. Our consolidated revenue growth continues to be driven by wireless and FiOS. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. In the first quarter these revenues totaled approximately $150 million, an increase of 25%. We continue to build upon our Internet of Things and video platforms. In particular innovation within the transportation industry presents a great opportunity for us.", "Through Verizon telematics we are already providing a platform of manufacturer, aftermarket and fleet services through two-way broadband connectivity to vehicle. Additionally, we will be launching Verizon Vehicle, our direct to consumer aftermarket product which modernizes traditional roadside assistance and enhances driver safety and convenience. In terms of video we are on track to launch our mobile first OTT video product this summer and we have already announced some initial content partners. We are excited about these new growth opportunities which you will hear more about during the year. In addition to top line growth, we continue to focus on process and operating efficiencies and improving our cost structure. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion in the quarter, up 5.8% and our EBITDA margin expanded by 60 basis points on an adjusted basis to 37.4%. As Mike indicated, we reported $1.02 in earnings per share in the quarter for a comparable growth rate of about 12%. So we are off to a strong start from an earnings perspective.", "Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 5. Consistent with capital allocation model, we have been executing in the last several years, our priorities are to invest in our networks through capital spending and spectrum acquisitions, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. Our strong cash flows enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and de-lever the balance sheet. The monetization of our tower portfolio enabled us to execute the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program.", "In the first quarter, cash flows from operations totaled $10.2 billion. This included approximately $2.4 billion related to the tower monetization transaction which is non-recurring. The remaining portion of the $5 billion of cash proceeds is reflected in the financing activities section of the cash flow statement. We also securitized the portion of our wireless equipment installment receivables and received $1.3 billion in cash proceeds during the quarter. Free cash flow excluding the tower proceeds totaled about $4.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $3.7 billion in the quarter. Although spending was slightly lower in the first quarter, we expect 2015 capital expenditures to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion.", "In wireless we continue investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. In the first quarter, wireless CapEx totaled $2.4 billion. As we have previously stated, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology in building solutions and distributed antenna systems. We are also beginning to refarm our 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G EVDO to 4G LTE in select markets. Despite what others claim about certain network metrics, we are consistently acknowledged as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent performance and continue to be the largest and most reliable 4G LTE network in the nation.", "Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Our financial de-leveraging plan had always assumed the purchase of new spectrum. In the first quarter, we paid the remaining balance of $9.5 billion for the AWS-3 licenses we won in the auction. During the past six months, we have been very active in the debt capital markets managing our maturities and taking advantage of the interest rate environment. We ended the quarter with $113.4 billion of gross debt, net debt of $109 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times. We are on track with the plans to de-lever and remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.", "Now, let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 6. Our wireless strategy is to provide the best customer experience while continuing to invest in our network to stay ahead of accelerating demand and higher customer usage. Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total wireless operating revenues were $22.3 billion in the first quarter, up 6.9%. Total service revenue of $17.9 billion declined 0.4%. Keep in mind that lower service revenue from Edge customers have shifted to equipment revenue. Service revenue plus Edge installment billings were up 3.1%.", "During the quarter, customer demand for our Edge equipment installment plan continued to increase. The percentage of phone activations on the Edge program was about 39% compared with about 25% in the fourth quarter. We expect the percentage of phone activations on Edge to increase in the second quarter as we are currently running near 50%. Edge phone activations totaled $3.4 million in the quarter and we now have an Edge phone base of $10 million, representing 11.7% of our postpaid phone base.", "In terms of profitability, we generated $10 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 55.8%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. As customer acceptance of equipment installment plans evolves and the percentage of Edge adoption increases, equipment revenue is increasing. Therefore, you should look at EBIT margin on total wireless revenue rather than wireless service revenue. On this basis, our EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue was 44.8% in the quarter, which was similar to a year ago.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with $108.6 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.5% to $102.6 million and our prepaid connections totaled $5.9 million. As expected, first quarter seasonality resulted in lower volumes. Postpaid gross additions were $3.7 million, up 2.3% compared to a year ago. A majority of the gross adds were 4G smartphones and tablets. Retail postpaid churn improved both sequentially and year-over-year coming in at 1.03% for the quarter.", "We are maintaining a disciplined approach with a focus on retaining high value customers. We are seeing good results with our postpaid smartphone churn less than 0.9% as compared to our basic phone churns at more than 1.2% in the quarter. Our retail postpaid net additions of 565,000 were up 4.8%. The quality of the net adds was very good. We added 621,000 new 4G smartphones and total net smartphones adds were 247,000 in the quarter. We also added 820,000 new 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds were a negative 138,000 as the smartphone adds were more than offset by a net decline of 385,000 basic phones. Additionally net prepaid devices declined by 188,000 in the quarter.", "Let\u2019s now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 8. Total postpaid device activations totaled 10.3 million in the quarter, up 4.4%. About 84% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 68.7 million smartphones in total, about 85% of which were 4G. Our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 80% of total phones. 4G devices now comprised approximately 70% of our retail postpaid connection space. About 86% of total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network. As you would expect growth in 4G device adoption continued to drive increased data and video usage.", "Within More Everything accounts average data usage continues to rise, up 54% year-over-year. This is beneficial to us because increasing consumption of content will ultimately drive higher revenue with a lower cost to serve due to the efficiency of our LTE network. In terms of our upgrade rate about 6.5% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the first quarter. This represents a sharp sequential decline in the percentage of customers upgrading which was expected due to seasonality and the extraordinary volumes we experienced in the fourth quarter. We continue to have an opportunity to upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices. At the end of the quarter we had roughly 17 million basic phones and about 11 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connection space. We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets. We ended the quarter with about 8.8 million tablets in our postpaid connection space, so overall penetration is still under 10%. Tablets provide us a good value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level.", "Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 9. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the first quarter, consumer revenues were up 4%, representing 11th consecutive quarter of 4% or better growth. Mass markets, which include small business grew 2.9%. FiOS now represents 78% of consumer revenue. In the first quarter FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8% driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and some pricing actions. Our FiOS Quantum broadband service is scaling well and has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 62% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribe to a data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier. We are just over 20% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe. We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In broadband we added 133,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.7 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.5% penetration. Overall net broadband subscribers increased by 41,000 in the quarter.", "In FiOS video we added 90,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.7 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 36% penetration. One of the ways we strive to improve the customer value proposition is by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. Last year we introduced quantum TV, Speed Match and our Quantum Gateway router. As part of the evolution of customer choice for video consumption, we just introduced FiOS Custom TV, which have been the last few days. The Custom TV option is a creative approach to the changing landscape allowing customers to better choose the type of content they want to watch. Customers will get a base package of pre-selected and local broadcast channels and choose at least two channel packs out of seven. This new option coupled with our traditional programming packages provides more choice, more control, and more value in an easy self-serve manner.", "In terms of our ongoing network evolution initiative, we converted about 47,000 Copper customers in the quarter. For the year, we plan to convert a total of 200,000 Copper customers to fiber. We are also in the process of decommissioning 10 central offices. Post conversion, we are seeing improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve. These conversions also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services from us. Our focus in 2015 will be to continue adding quality customers driving higher penetration in existing markets and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are highly competitive markets and we will be disciplined and rationale in our approach to customer acquisition.", "With that, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the wireline segment in total. In the enterprise space, we continue work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 6%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure, the revenue decline would have been more in line with trends we experienced in the second half of 2014. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications and services.", "In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 3.7% in the first quarter. Healthy demand for Ethernet services continues, but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth. We also had a favorable, which improved revenue this quarter and which will not reoccur. Total operating revenues for the entire wireline segment were down 2%, which included the FX pressure.", "In terms of profitability, the EBITDA margin was 22.7% in the quarter, up 20 basis points. Our path to a stronger and more profitable wireline business includes driving further FiOS penetration and continued improvements in operating and capital efficiency. On the enterprise business side, we are changing the revenue mix to higher growth areas like cloud, security and professional services. In terms of our cost structure, we are realizing a number of noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon\u2019s Lean Six Sigma principles. However, we are far from satisfied and we will continue working to improve our overall cost structure.", "Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We are off to a strong start to 2015. From a strategic standpoint, we were successful in the spectrum auction, executed a tower portfolio monetization, and signed a definitive agreement to sell certain wireline properties. At the same time, we return value to shareholders with an accelerated share repurchase program. We also delivered strong operating and financial performance with 12% growth in earnings per share on an adjusted basis.", "Our first quarter results demonstrate that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high-quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are on track to achieve our targets of at least 4% consolidated revenue growth, sustained profitability and capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015.", "Consolidated EBITDA grew by 5.8% and our EBITDA margin expanded to 37.4%. In addition to our ability to deliver strong financial metrics, we are very focused on developing new products and services in the Internet of Things and video. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our de-leveraging plans are on track. And we remain committed to getting back to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you, Fran. David we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Simon Flannery", "Thanks very much. Good morning Fran. So, you had a couple of management changes in the first quarter, John Stratton taking over as President of Operations and combining the IT and network units, can you give us a little bit of color of any sort of implications, any strategies or anything that has happened as a result of that? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Sure. Thanks Simon. So, as we have moved into our next space as well has consolidated the operational performance under John. This gives us a better breadth of consolidation if you will post the Vodafone acquisition. And if you go back to when we did the acquisition, we stated that there were some internal valves that could be broken down and we could become more efficient. And with the establishment of Marni Walden\u2019s organization around new products and services this is where we are get into the Internet of Things and over the top video she runs Verizon digital media services and some of the other incubation companies we have. So the focus is running the day-to-day operations out of John\u2019s organization and streamlining, implementing Verizon lean six sigma and driving those cost benefits and efficiencies that we are looking for.", "With Marni\u2019s organization it\u2019s creating the new products and services that we can launch to grow the future of the businesses. And then with Roger and the consolidation of the network and the IT organization, it just makes sense as we move into more software developed network areas and more the network is driven out of data centers it makes sense that Roger would take over the entire thing from an efficiency and consistency of management perspective. So I think what you are seeing here is more well organized within the company, more cohesiveness and more direct relationship between growing revenue and cost reduction.", "Simon Flannery", "Okay, great. So no real changes in the sort of cost trajectory or the CapEx trajectory?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, CapEx we have given you guidance of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. And right now we are staying on track with that. You should see that ramp up through the rest of the year and obviously coming out of the auction we added $500 million to that to densify and build out and that takes a little bit of queuing up time, so you will see that more in the back end of the year. And as far as cost reductions you have seen some of the measures we took at the end of the fourth quarter. If you look at wireline alone, wireline is down over 5,400 people from the beginning of last year. So continuing to streamline that business and become more efficient. And for wireless as John has taken over we are starting to see some streamlining around customer service and some the other things that we have talked about in the past. So I wouldn\u2019t downplay the cost reductions that we will realize in the future here.", "Simon Flannery", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay David. Let\u2019s take the next question please.", "Operator", "One moment please. Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just two if I could, Fran on the quarter, I think the two numbers that really stood out to people were number one, the really low SG&A in wireless, I think going back for a model maybe the lowest percentage of wireless revenue we have ever seen, if you can kind of step us through how we got there from last quarter and what the outlook for that would be, it would be huge. And then the second big number was really the ARPA number, which I think stepped down further than people thought, that could have been related to EIP or it could have been pricing environment in the market or retention efforts that you are executing on, could you kind of give us the picture for how we got to where we got in ARPA and kind of what we can think about that for the rest of the year? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks David. Just a clarification here on the wireless revenue you are talking about service revenue?", "David Barden", "I was actually talking about total revenue as a percentage for SG&A, but either way was a really low number?", "Fran Shammo", "Okay, yes. So look, I mean I think that if you look at the service revenue and ARPA it all goes to the same issue which is as we start to elevate Edge and we start to increase the take rate of Edge and customers move, you are shifting revenue out of service and into equipment. So you are going to continue to see a decline in service revenue. You are going to continue to see a decline in ARPA, but I think what I would center around is what we said in the script, which was we grew overall revenue by 6.9%. And also if you look at the EBITDA margin which kind of normalizes out the Edge impact, I mean, not 100% of it, but if you look at a dollar of revenue and a dollar of cost there is zero margin. So, if you look at total revenue, 44.8% whereas last year at 44.9%. So, it\u2019s a very consistent profitability measure.", "The other thing too is if you look at the Edge benefits, you are getting benefits from both lower commissions and so forth, so that is also impacting the SG&A line, because you are indirect before if you think about how that works. We were refunding the indirect through a commission payment for the subsidy of the handset that all goes away. So, you are going to see a decline in the commission expense line, which is impacting the SG&A line. But overall, if you look at the profitability of wireless and I think this is important, if you look at the service margin of 55.8%, if you were to normalize out Edge, the wireless service margin would still have been in that over 50%. So, the profitability of wireless continues to be extremely strong. And again I would go back to what Simon brought up. I would not discount all of the cost reductions and efficiencies that we are creating in the environment.", "David Barden", "So, this is a good baseline for kind of extrapolating the rest of the year?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I mean, from a rest of a year standpoint, I think that the outlook is strong. I think that obviously as Edge continues to escalate, you are going to get some benefit there. We highlighted the depreciation benefit. But I think as far as wireless goes, I think we need to be careful here a little bit, because January normally is a slow promotional, slow seasonal quarter. As you go into the second quarter and you enter into Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day, I would expect that the promotional activity and competitive is going to heat up here. So, that will offset some of the benefits that you are going to see. So, look I think that service revenue and ARPA will continue to decline as the Edge rate takes up, but it\u2019s really about overall revenue growth and the profitability of the business and we feel good about that.", "David Barden", "Perfect. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, thank you. David, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick", "Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess first if I can follow-up, Fran on the Edge stuff, can you help us think about the high-end of the Edge mix given the distribution of where you sell this? What portion of your sales are in channels that don\u2019t have access to the Edge program?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, all of our channels have access to the Edge program, but obviously within our store channel, it is very, very heavily weighted towards Edge at this point. We are doing very little subsidy model selling out of the store channel and it\u2019s because where the market has moved. I mean, when your entire competitive environment is just advertising and promoting service pricing and ignoring the whole equipment side, we have to follow that in order to be competitive. So, the store channel by far is very heavily weighted towards Edge. Indirect is starting to come up as time goes, but also keep in mind the business channel and our enterprise channel are not really taking the Edge product. So, if you are asking me, we will get to 100%, the answer is no. I can\u2019t tell you exactly what that percent will be, but we do see that second quarter will probably be in the neighborhood of a 50% take rate.", "Phil Cusick", "Okay. And then second I like the Custom TV launch this morning, there is some controversy around ESPN and Disney, can I ask do you guys have explicit permission for this and have Disney and other pushed back since Friday to you or is this just a storm in the media? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I think the right way to answer this without getting into too public about our contractual situations. Look, this is a product that the consumer wants. It\u2019s all about consumer choice. I mean, if you look at the TV bundles today, most people only on average watch 17 channels. So, this is a way to give consumers what they want on a choice basis. And we believe that we are allowed to offer these packages under our existing contracts. So, we will leave it at that.", "Phil Cusick", "Thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Rollins", "Thanks. Just a couple of follow-ups and then a question. The follow-ups is first, can you just give us the ending net receivable balance for the installment phones and what that was last quarter? And then are you allowing for installment plans early migration on them, is that something you are using to get the take rate of Edge up? And then just a broader question I had if I could is if you could just address the larger strategy for wireline as you went through a quarter of monetizing some additional or announcing the monetization of some additional assets, what\u2019s your thoughts longer term for your wireline business? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Mike. So, on the accounts receivable, I am not going to get too much detail here on this call, but if you look at the fourth quarter to the first quarter with the securitization that we did it\u2019s relatively flat. On early migration on Edge customers, obviously we have an Edge up feature, but you must pay 75% of the phone off. So, if you decide to pay 75% of your balance off, you can upgrade at any point in time you want. And we do have customers who are taking that and edging up, but there is no \u201cearly migration\u201d other than what\u2019s instituted in the price plan.", "On the wireline strategy, look I mean if you look at the three properties that we announced to sell Florida, Texas and California, they were more or less islands to us. They were some of the first properties we build out with FiOS. They are heavily penetrated properties. But the majority of those properties are still copper. And as we look at that strategically, when we laid this out, it just made sense based on the offer that Frontier had in front of us to actually sell those properties. So, I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it other than the fact that they were not strategic properties, because they were islands, but if you look at the rest of our wireline footprint from DC all the way up through Boston, it\u2019s very contiguous. It\u2019s highly populated. We have almost 20 million homes passed now with FiOS. So, it\u2019s extremely viable for us to continue to penetrate these properties. And if you look at the penetration rates, New York is still the lowest penetrated market that we have and still has the highest growth opportunity that we have. So, we are holding on to some of the markets that we believe are contiguous. You will see more and more with wireless and wireline combined under John\u2019s leadership. So, there is more that we can do strategically with the footprint that we have and again it just made financial sense to return that back to our shareholder and bring that cash into de-lever the balance sheet. So, that\u2019s really there all is to it, Michael.", "Mike Rollins", "Thanks very much.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking the question. The smartphone metrics continue to be really impressive. But as you note in the presentation about 20% of your subs still have feature phones, so I was wondering if you could just walk us through what is the strategy for upgrading and retain those subs, particularly because it seems that your competitors are continually targeting that base? And should it be reasonable to think that at this point in the upgrade process, we might continue to see some modest degree of net losses in the phone base whereas what we saw in the first quarter is just a seasonal factor?", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Brett. Well, I guess a couple of things here. So, we still have 17 million basic and 11 million 3G phones and coming out of the fourth quarter, you heard me say that we were going to protect our base. And that was a key ingredient going into the first quarter. And I think with the churn rate you have seen if you look at the basic phone losses on a year-over-year basis, we actually improve that by over 400,000. So last year, we had almost doubled the number of basic phone loss customers than we did this year. And as you notice, we came out with some strong promotional pricing that was targeted towards the basic phone customer and the 3G customer. Now, having said all that, look the environment is, is that there if you look at prepaid on a standalone basis, our prepaid retail pricing is slightly at a premium to some of the other competitors\u2019 postpaid pricing. So, we are in a competitive pricing standpoint. And as I said coming out of the fourth quarter, we will not \u2013 we have to be rationale and we will not chase every customer, but we are making every effort to maintain our base and keep our customers and upgrade them into a price plan that\u2019s fitting for them. And we made improvement in that. But I will tell you we still have some more improvement to do, but we are not satisfied with any losses. But then again, we will not chase every add either, based on just cheap price. So, I think that\u2019s the balanced equation that we showed in the first quarter.", "Brett Feldman", "And just a quick follow-up I believe in the past you said some of the small offices you have seen have generally been customers that were not as profitable, is that still the case?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I think what I said was if it\u2019s not quite I wouldn\u2019t put it in a profitability perspective, but what I would say is if it\u2019s customer who is just price sensitive and does not care about the quality of the network or is sufficient with just paying a lower price, then that\u2019s probably a customer we are not going to be able to keep on the Verizon wireless network.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking the question.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike McCormack", "Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe if you could just comment regarding subscriber quality, maybe add net add quality or base quality and just thinking about the credit scores within the base, the prime mix and obviously we are seeing a lot of prepaid migration into postpaid is what you guys are seeing with respect to that? And as a follow-up, just a comment if you would on the appetite for additional factoring, how we should be firming that for the full year? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Sure. So, on the securitization piece of the business, yes, you should anticipate that this will be an ongoing program on a quarterly basis going forward. As far as the quality of our base, I think the quality of our base speaks for itself. We have not made any credit policy changes. We have a very strong quality base, but there are a certain segment of our customers as I just discussed around basic, where we are trying to bring them up into a price plan that\u2019s meaningful for them. But if you look at \u2013 again, if you look at the lay of the land around price plans, as I said our prepaid pricing is a little bit of a premium to some other postpaid pricing in the marketplace. And as you saw this quarter, we lost 188,000 prepaid retail customers. I can\u2019t answer specifically where they went, but I would say that they probably made a choice to go to a price \u2013 postpaid price plan, because it\u2019s actually slightly lower on some competitors than it is with us on prepaid. So, I can\u2019t factually state that, but I think that\u2019s some of the migration, but also I would also say that on the reseller side, which we don\u2019t talk much about, we had a very strong growth through our TracFone relationship over 400,000 some net adds this quarter. So, it could have been a migration from retail to wholesale, but I do think there is a migration from the prepaid base into some other postpaid bases and I think others will have to talk to that, but we are not seeing a lot of that within our base.", "Mike McCormack", "And Fran, just how do you frame the credit risk on these installment plans, I mean, I am assuming you guys obviously have pretty tight credit standards, but if you see this as a risk for you guys on the industry, just I mean more and more loans out there for Apple phones?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, sure, I mean, obviously it adds risk to the balance sheet, because you are putting up a very large receivable now before it was just service revenue that you are risk add. And if you look at the economics of service revenue, it really is what\u2019s the economic loss to the company really comes down to what\u2019s the actual economic loss of providing the service to the customer. It\u2019s not actually the retail service revenue that\u2019s the loss. So, obviously, the cost of service is minimal. So, the loss was a lot less. Now, you are actually putting up a receivable that has a dollar for dollar loss if the customer does not pay. And again, we are very comfortable with the credit models we use. As I said, we really haven\u2019t changed our credit and we have a very strong credit base. So, I am not \u2013 at this point, I don\u2019t see any trends that will be concerning me on the outstanding receivable at this point.", "Mike McCormack", "Great. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik", "Hey, thanks. Two quick ones. First, following up on the video tiering, Fran, could you talk a little bit about maybe sort of expected sort of penetration that you expect with these new plans and maybe compare the profitability of these new services to sort of traditional TV subscriptions? And then from Edge standpoint, you have guided to flat consolidated margins for the year, but as you see the higher take rate of Edge and first of all, where that can go for the year, could that drive better wireless margin trends and lead to better overall consolidated margins for the company? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, John. So, on the video tiers look, I think it\u2019s way, way too early to start talking about what the take rate is or where the profitability. So, we will leave that until we get some trending behind us. Obviously, we have done this because of consumer benefit, give the consumer a better choice. So, let\u2019s see what happens here as we go in and we can address that later. On the EBITDA margins, look I mean I am kind of reiterating our guidance that we came out of the fourth quarter from an outlook perspective. And I think that you have to be cognizant of the fact that this is the first quarter of the year. If you look at last year\u2019s trending as we said coming out of the Vodafone transaction, our earnings profile would be more consistent across the quarters. We wouldn\u2019t be as bumpy as we had been in the past. I think that you have to look at the whole thing in retrospect.", "And also the other thing is I would not get focused in on the service margins side and as I said I would really prefer as to look at the total margin \u2013 total revenue and the EBITDA margin. And if you saw the EBITDA margin was very, very strong for wirelesses this quarter. And that kind of normalizes out a little bit of what the Edge take rate is. And then again I also can\u2019t speak to what we are in for from a competitive standpoint on additional pricing moves through the year. So, I am kind of reserving on that side of the equation as well from an outlook perspective. So, on outlook and profitability, I would say reiterating what we said in the fourth quarter and more consistent earnings profile moving forward. So, I think that\u2019s where we will leave it.", "John Hodulik", "Great. Thanks Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David another question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you very much and good morning Fran and Mike.", "Fran Shammo", "Good morning Amir.", "Michael Stefanski", "Good morning.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "You folks highlighted that 4G devices now constitute approximately 70% of the retail postpaid connections and that traffic or LTE network handles about 86% of the total wireless data traffic for the quarter, given these dynamics what seems to be a rapid adoption of LTE technology, I was wondering if you could give us an update on your ability to reform spectrum in order to take advantage of the network efficiency opportunities. Fran you had mentioned that they are continued cost reduction opportunities that your scale provides you and any color there would be helpful?", "Fran Shammo", "Good. Thanks Amir. Yes. So I think that this is all point to where the future growth of the business comes from. I mean there is not many businesses where consumers want to consume more and more and if you look at it 86% of the usage is on the LTE network. And if you look at our More Everything accounts they are up 54% in consumption year-over-year. So, obviously consumers are willing to consume the content on their wireless devices which is why we were so optimistic around Internet of Things and of course over the top mobile. Now as you start to look at the densification and the efficiency of the network, as I said in my prepared remarks we are already starting to reap on the 1,900 PCS licenses in certain markets and we still have a long way to go there.", "Also we are looking at as I said the LTE unlicensed which is a really good fit with the licensed LTE piece which will give us a lot more download capability in a managed network comparability. So there is a lot that we can still do around our spectrum and efficiency and obviously with the LTE network as you have seen with 86% of that traffic running on it with a 54% overall year-over-year increase the cost structure of the business really has not changed because the ability to deliver this on a very cost efficient network is there. So I would just continue to say that as we continue to grow on the consumption model what we did in the AWS spectrum in buying the licenses and our plan to build out and densify, I think we are in a very good financial position to execute on that in a very financially disciplined manner and continue to generate the returns that are expected of us.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Great. And then one quick follow-up if I may, you folks have been consistent noting that de-leveraging the balance sheet is the priority for you. And as you mentioned it seems as though the approach you took to the AWS-3 bidding process seems to reflects that strategy, how should we think about your ability or resources available to pursue other assets in the market, specifically I am thinking about the potential broadcast spectrum auction or any material third party portfolios if they were to come to market?", "Fran Shammo", "I think look I mean we are very focused on our balance sheet and we are committed to de-lever and as we said coming out of the Vodafone transaction we had four priorities. One was to continue to invest in our networks and platforms, which we are, to buy spectrum, which we did to have a competitive dividend payout, which we are and to de-lever the balance sheet. And we will continue to do all that. As far as any type of strategic acquisitions or additional spectrum we are probably alluding to the incentive auction and I think that we are just going to have to wait to see what the rules are before we decide how we are going to execute on or around the incentive auction. So I think that still a little bit ways out before we can make that decision. But look, we have positioned the balance sheet to be able to execute on the strategies that we need to execute on in order to deliver the future growth and earnings of the business. And I think we are in a very, very sound position to do that.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Great. Thank you very much for the color.", "Michael Stefanski", "David next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Jennifer Fritzsche", "Hi, Fran. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask about over the top video service offering, I know we are going to see a more formal unveiling this summer, but can you just discuss kind of the news floor, what we should be honing? And two, as you go into that announcement, I mean, I assume it\u2019s more content announcements? And then on the packages you announced last week, should we consider this separate from the OTP or kind of a precursor of this integrated wireline \u2013 wireless model?", "Fran Shammo", "Okay. So, first on over-the-top video, as we have talked before you see us announcing some of the content deals that are in this, but it goes back to what I said before, this is all around having the consumer consume more content on their wireless handset through the Verizon wireless network. And we know that consumers want one content. We know what the viewership is and this is appealing to mobile content and let\u2019s not confuse that with linear TV content. So, I would not read into the Custom TV package as a precursor to the over-the-top video, it\u2019s not. These are two very distinct ecosystems. As far as the monetization model, when you think about the monetization, there is many different avenues we can do on this. There could be premium subscriptions. There could be pay-per-views using the multicast technology. There can be advertising model so that the consumer does not pay for the content consumption or as others would call sponsored data. So, I think there is lot of models that we can use and I hate to say this, but let\u2019s wait until Marni and team are ready to make the big splash here this summer and then we can have more discussion around what it means.", "Jennifer Fritzsche", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, we have time for one more question if we can take the last question please.", "Operator", "Your last question today comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tim Horan", "Thanks guys. Fran, the wireless data growth is fairly incredible at this size and base. Do you think you have pricing power for wireless data to your competitors aren\u2019t really charging all that much for? Do you think that will change in the industry as maybe the networks get filled up, your thoughts? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I think this is the great lead way into the over-the-top mobile. And it\u2019s developing more ecosystems around monetizing the consumption that happens on the network. Obviously, we are in a period of time where we see the service pricing dilution because of the installments out. And I think that will continue. And of course, we are increasing bundles, so more data for the same price, but this is no different, Tim, than what we saw on the voice world way back where we had a price and then all of a sudden everybody started seeing dilution on the minute per minute price, because more minutes were being given away in the bundle and we saw a little bit of access accretion, but overall, pricing was coming down. And then all of a sudden, the usage tracks started up again and revenue took a turn. And I think that\u2019s the piece that we are in with \u2013 right now with the data world, but the key to this is to develop these other ecosystems to create more monetization around customer usage whether that\u2019s premium subscription pay-per-view or advertising models. And that\u2019s really what we are concentrating on.", "Tim Horan", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, thank you. Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back to Fran for a few closing remarks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Thanks for everybody for joining Verizon this morning. We are absolutely off to a good start to the year. We stated coming out of the fourth quarter that we return to historical margin in wireless and we delivered on that. We also stated that we would continue to improve the profitability of our wireline business and we delivered on that. We had a good growth quarter. We had strong profits and strong cash flows. We look forward to a very positive 2015 and we look very hopeful and confident in our ability to execute on our strategy, grow the business profitably, and invest for the future.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty.John DohertyThanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I am John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo; and well as Mike Stefanski, who recently assumed our role as Head of Investor Relations.Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be available on our website later today.I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. I would also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks, are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I would like to cover the differences between reported an adjusted earnings this quarter. These are displayed on slide three. For the quarter, we reported a loss of $1.48 per share on a GAAP basis. This quarter, there were several significant non-operational charges that we\u2019d like to highlight. The largest item is a pre-tax charge of $7.2 billion related primarily to the non-cash yearend mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This charge is due primarily to changes in the discount rate and other actuarial assumptions, as well as the annuitization of various pension liabilities during the quarter.On an after-tax basis, this charge amounted to $4.4 billion or $1.55 per share. We also incurred pre-tax charges of $1.4 billion related to early retirement of debt and other restructuring activities. Most of the charges are debt redemption costs resulting from a tender offer for a high coupon note during the quarter. On an after-tax basis, this charge was $871 million or $0.31 per share.By excluding $1.86 per share for these non-operational charges, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.38. This adjusted result includes $319 million of direct impact from superstore Sandy which equates to $0.07 per share. Excluding the Sandy impacts, adjusted EPS would have been $0.45 for the fourth quarter and full year results on the same basis would have been $2.31 per share.With that, I will turn the call over to Fran.Fran ShammoThanks John. Good morning everyone and Happy New Year. Before we get into the details, let me start with some overview comments to put our fourth quarter and 2012 results in context.As we have outlined in the past, our strategy is to build upon the strong foundation of our superior network assets as platforms for growth and innovation. This positions us in the center of the trends that are driving growth in our industry. We have been consistently focused on better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business to capture growth opportunities in three key areas.In wireless, we\u2019re looking to take advantage of opportunities driven by the rapid evolution of 4G LTE. Another key area is FiOS, where we are looking to further penetrate the consumer and small business markets. We\u2019re also looking to drive growth in enterprise strategic services, particularly in the areas of global IP, Cloud computing, security and managed services.From a financial standpoint, our focus is on execution, capturing incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business, increasing our cash flow and improving our earnings profile. During the year, we made good progress across the entire business which I will detail more in the segment reviews.In addition to our solid execution, we also continued to make smart investments for future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continued to invest in networks and new technologies which will be the platforms for accelerated growth going forward.On the strategic front, we closed several key transactions that will significantly improve our competitive position, namely the acquisition of additional spectrum, the purchase of Hughes Telematics, the creation of Redbox Instant by Verizon, our continued investment in Verizon Digital Media Services and the annuitization of $7.5 billion of pension obligations. We are also focused on joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners and we expect to continue to build on our leadership position in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem.From a shareholder value perspective, we generated a total return of 13.2% in 2012 through a combination of stock price appreciation and dividends.For the sixth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and improved earnings profile in 2013 and beyond.Let\u2019s begin with a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide 5. Revenues from strategic growth areas drove a $5 billion improvement in our topline in 2012 and increased our annual growth rate by 50 basis points to 4.5%.In the fourth quarter, consolidated revenue growth increased to 5.7%, which was our highest quarterly growth of the year. Our positive momentum in wireless and FiOS, together with our continued focus on improving the revenue mix in our enterprise business gives us confidence that we can drive topline growth in 2013.Let\u2019s take a closer look at earnings on slide 6. Our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in double digit growth in adjusted operating income for the year. Through the first nine months, we posted double-digit adjusted earnings growth. In the fourth quarter, our bottom line results were impacted by decision to take advantage of our strong wireless market position, which enabled historic customer growth and smartphone penetration gain.Additionally, the significant challenges created by super storm Sandy, certainly had an impact on the business in the fourth quarter. As a result, 2012 earnings per share adjusted for the non-operational charges John outlined earlier, came to $2.24. One additional comment I would make related to Sandy is that while we were able to specifically identify a direct impact to the wireline business in the fourth quarter, it was extremely difficult to effectively quantify the actual impact to normal operations. I will talk more about this later.Now let's move into a review of the segments starting with wireless on slide seven. As one of our key growth platforms, we have consistently invested in wireless to differentiate ourselves in terms of network quality, reliability, and the overall customer experience. Five year ago, we made a bold commitment to 4G LTE as the next generation technology. Since then we have invested in the technology and its deployment.We secured valuable spectrum. We fostered our robust device ecosystem. And this past year, we introduced share data plans that changed the industry\u2019s pricing framework. These actions have resulted in consistent sequential growth throughout 2012. Coming off a strong third quarter, we made a strategic decision to take advantage of our 4G LTE lead and invest in growth, which resulted in a record high post paid gross and net adds in the quarter.In his keystone address at CES a few weeks ago, Lowell showcased our long-term vision of what is possible with the 4G LTE, highlighting innovation applications under development in areas like video, the connected environment, healthcare, and energy. Our new brand advertising campaign with the theme \u2018powerful answers\u2019 demonstrates our vision of network innovation and the many growth opportunities which will expand the industry in the coming years.In 2012, wireless operating revenues totaled $75.9 billion, up 8.1%. Wireless now represents more than 65% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. Service revenue increased $4.6 billion or 7.7% for the year, driven by connections growth and increasing smartphone penetration. This service revenue growth together with our intense focus on cost efficiency and our ability to retain customers is clearly helping to mitigate equipment cost pressures.Our success in capturing these cost savings resulted in higher profitability growth in 2012. EBITDA grew $3.2 billion or 12.2% for the year, and we expected our industry leading EBITDA service margins by 180 basis points to 46.6%. Let's now turn to a more detailed look at volume growth beginning on slide eight.Throughout 2012, we saw accelerating sequential growth in the postpaid market, culminating in record net adds in the fourth quarter. We had a great year of postpaid connections growth enabling us to gain market share. Postpaid growth additions were up 6%, and postpaid net adds increased by almost 800,000 to 5 million, our highest annual net add total in four years. During the fourth quarter, we added more than 2.2 million new retail connections, with 2.1 million postpaid and 142,000 prepaid. We have an industry leading 98.2 million retail connections with 92.5 million postpaid and 5.7 million prepaid.Our postpaid connections represent 35.1 million accounts. Within the postpaid net add mix this quarter, 1.9 million were smartphones and about 600,000 were internet devices. The remainder being the net change in basic phones. Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were a record 4.7 million, up 18% sequentially and 29% year-over-year. In terms of upgrades 9% of our postpaid connection space upgraded during the quarter, up from around 7% in the third quarter and less than the 10% we experienced a year ago. Our churn matrix continued to be market leading. Retail postpaid churn was 0.95%.Next, let\u2019s turn to slide nine and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Our record sales volume in the fourth quarter included 12.5 million postpaid devices, more than 90% of which were phones. As we\u2019ve seen each quarter, an increasing majority of these phone sales were smartphones. In the fourth quarter, we activated 9.8 million smartphones, which was by far our highest total ever. About 65% of these smartphones were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated about 6.2 million in the quarter and almost half were 4G LTE.Android phones made up a majority of the remaining smartphones and over 95% were 4G LTE. Our smartphone penetration increased from 53% last quarter to 58%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 44%.A key point of differentiation for us which speaks to our incremental revenue opportunity is the improved mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the fourth quarter, gross adds for new to Verizon represented about 30% of total smartphone activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% to 23% range we reported throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012.We also have an incremental revenue potential within our upgrades. as about 42% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time. In addition, if we include customers upgrading from a 3G to a 4G LTE smartphone, considering the likelihood of higher data usage, we can say that three out of four upgrades represent incremental revenue going into 2013.Customer adoption of 4G LTE is really gaining momentum. While we have seen a steady increase in sales of 4G LTE devices each quarter since we launched service, the sequential increase in the fourth quarter was much more dramatic. Total 4G LTE device sales increased to $7.3 million, up 60% from the third quarter. Smartphone activations represented $6.4 million of this total, up 74% sequentially. Virtually all internet device sales in the quarter were 4G LTE, with turbo sales doubling over the third quarter.At the end of the year, 4G LTE phones and devices represented 23.3% of total retail postpaid connections. 34% of our smartphones and 58% of our internet devices are now 4G LTE. Almost half of our total data traffic is on the 4G LTE network, which we believe is five times more efficient than 3G. As we have stated throughout the year, we are no longer adding capacity to our 3G network.While the 4G LTE connections and data volumes are impressive, we expect that these percentages will continue to grow as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE. In terms of 4G LTE geographic coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 476 markets, covering more than 273 million pops or about 89% of the U.S population. We intend to continue leveraging our advantage and expanding coverage, with the goal of having a nationwide 4G LTE footprint similar to our 3G network by midyear 2013.Let\u2019s take a closer look at our quarterly revenue performance on slide 10. Total wireless revenues grew 9.5% to $20 billion in the fourth quarter. Service revenue grew 8.5% in the fourth quarter, driven by equally strong retail service revenue growth. As you know, last quarter we begun disclosing new retail postpaid metrics, replacing ARPU with ARPA, as well as providing the number of postpaid accounts and the average connections per account.During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than $146 per month, an increase of 6.6%. The average connections per account increased to 2.64, up more than 4%. In just six months, 23% of our postpaid accounts are on a shared everything plan. Customers are quickly recognizing the value proposition. Adoption is ahead of our expectations and we continue to see customers adding devices to their plans and increasing their users tiers.Let\u2019s conclude our wireless review on slide 11. Our EBITDA service margin of 41.4% in the quarter was impacted by higher retail gross adds and the increased mix of smartphone sales this quarter, in addition to stronger indirect channel performance. During the fourth quarter we activated 2 million more smartphones than we did a year ago and saw only an 80 basis point differential in the margin. In terms of absolute dollars, we generated $6.8 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 6.3% year-over-year. This strong customer growth and increased smartphone penetration drove service revenue and increased ARPA.Our intense focus on cost efficiency is helping to mitigate the cost of equipment subsidies and commissions. Our industry leading customer retention is also a key factor in our profitability, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader and we have great momentum heading into 2013. We fully expect to sustain our very strong service revenue growth and increase our profitability this year.Last year, we saw margins recover quickly from heavy smartphone sales in the fourth quarter of 2011. In 2013, we expect the wireless EBITDA margins will rebound within the range of the record levels we reported in the second and third quarter of 2012. Let's move next to our wireline segment starting on slide 12.In wireline, we are focused on migrating customers to fiber assets which provide better services and capabilities, such as FiOS, IP-based applications, and cloud solutions. These services are also more efficient and in the long run improve our cost structure. The wireline business made positive strides in 2012 and fundamentals are improving in the strategic growth areas. From a topline perspective, we have encouraging signs in the consumer market, where we posted the strongest topline growth in ten years.In enterprise, we continue to manage through the secular and global economic challenges. Our product rationalization initiatives are also putting near-term pressure on revenue growth, but we are confident that these initiatives which include significant efforts in the area of process and systems streamlining, will prove to be the right decision as we build a fundamentally stronger business.In terms of profitability, we do not see the margin improvement we were expecting in the second half of 2012, due primarily to the length of the time it took to reach an agreement with our unions and also to the significant business disruption caused by the challenges of Sandy. Our 2012 EBITDA margin of 21.3% includes $319 million of direct impact from Sandy. Again, it was very difficult to effectively quantify the indirect impact caused by this disruption. Sandy had a dramatic effect, particularly on the wireline business due to the heavy concentration of damage in the New York metropolitan area.Our challenge was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible while still managing to meet the demand for new services. We also made a strategic decision to use storm restoration as an opportunity to accelerate fiber migrations in both the enterprise and FiOS markets.During the course of the year, we successfully migrated 223,000 residential homes to fiber, exceeding our target for 2012. These customer migrations increased in the second half of the year and picked up considerably in the aftermath of Sandy. From an operational standpoint, we saw an 11% improvement in our overall copper-trouble report rate for the year. This marked the first decline in four years and helped to lower the number of dispatches and reduce our repair costs. Providing these customers with a greater opportunity to purchase FiOS services is also gaining some traction.For customers that have decided to upgrade to additional FiOS services, we are seeing a $45 lift in monthly ARPU. We are pleased with our progress to date and view the copper-to-fiber migration plan as an important part of our strategy to reduce the wireline cost structure. In 2013, we are targeting an additional 300,000 homes within the FiOS markets.Let's take a closer look at the revenue components, starting with mass markets on slide 13. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue growth of 4.1% was driven by FiOS, where revenue increase nearly 16% and now represents about 68% of consumer revenue. Consumer revenue growth was impacted in the quarter by service credits and customer billing suspensions resulting from Super Storm Sandy. The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth in consumer ARPU which increased to more than $105 per month, up 9.5%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150 per month and two thirds of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play, with voice, internet and video services.In terms of broadband customer growth, we had 144,000 new FiOS internet additions in the quarter and now have 5.4 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In HSI or DSL, we had a net loss of 117,000 customers. Net broadband subscribers were a positive 27,000, marking an improvement over the past two quarters.Looking at the full year, broadband revenue growth improved by 3.1%, in spite of the fact that subscriber growth slowed to 1.4%. This revenue growth was driven by customers buying up in speed, taking advantage of our FiOS quantum offers. I would also attribute some of the improvement to our corporate fiber migration initiative.In FiOS video, we added 134,000 in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.7 million which is 33% penetration. Our FiOS customer growth in the fourth quarter was very good. In fact, net adds were greater than the second and third quarters. This was in spite of the significant disruption caused by the Sandy restoral efforts. In contrast to the second half of 2011, we decided to aggressively meet the increased demand for our FiOS services by authorizing overtime so that we did not lose customers by making them wait until we caught up to the backlog.I would also add that our residential connection trends continued to improve. During the fourth quarter, we lost 156,000 retail residential connections, representing a 6.2% decline year over year, compared with the loss of 183,000 or 7.3% at this time last year.Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next on slide 14. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $83 million or 2.1%, all of which was due to lower CPE sales. Strategic services, which comprised 54% of global enterprise revenue, totaled $2.1 billion and were up 5.3%.During the quarter, we continued to see delays in new contracts and investment decisions as enterprises exercise caution with regard to the fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other government policy changes. This uncertainty created a wait and see approach that clearly impacted new business in 2012. We continue to believe that as these factors evolve, companies will be in a better position to make decisions about their capital commitments. We remain hopeful that enterprises will renew their investing activities in 2013.Moving next to global wholesale. Fourth quarter revenues declined $168 million or 8.7% year over year, due primarily to continued declines in transport services. Again, our strategy is to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and better position the business in the fiber based Ethernet data services space as customers with Special Access transition from DS1s and DS3s.Let\u2019s conclude our wire line review on slide 15. In the second half of the year, we saw some improvement in topline performance. In the fourth quarter, wire line revenue was down 1.5%, repressing an 80 basis improvement over the rate of decline in the third quarter. Sequentially, revenue increased $76 million or 0.8%. in terms of cost, as I said earlier, this was a very challenging quarter and far from normal when you factor in the additional resources devoted to Sandy restoral efforts and to quickly catching up on our FiOS order backlog.On the labor front, after 400 days of negotiations with our unions, we have a fair and balanced three year agreement that is good for our employees as well as a positive for the business.In the consumer and mass markets business, we are confident that several factors will lead to an increasing contribution to wire line profitability in 2013. These include our focus on driving FiOS revenue growth and improving our operating and capital efficiency, the continued success of our copper to fiber migration initiative and the benefits of the new union contracts.In enterprise, we still see uncertainty around the debt ceiling, deficit reduction and tax reform. We are all looking at the same published reports about international economic growth which point to continued pressure on enterprise spending. We believe the actions we are taking will ultimately improve our cost structure and are the right steps to improving wire line profitability. In the short term, we expect similar performance within our enterprise unit. If some of the uncertainty is dealt with by Washington, than things can improve throughout 2013. I would like to turn now to slide 16 to discuss our cash flow results and how we further strengthened our balance sheet in 2012.Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and disciplined capital spending. For the year, cash flow from operations grew 5.7% to $31.5 billion and free cash flow increased to $15.3 billion, up 13%. Capital expenditures for 2012, totaled $16.2 billion, down about $70 million from last year. Capital expenditures for 2012, totaled $16.2 billion, down about $70 million from last year. This includes about $135 million in capital related to Sandy.Our capital efficiency improved ending the year at 14%. With the heavier investments to transform our business largely behind us, we expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low, to continue to decline based on disciplined capital spending and sustainable revenue growth.In wireless, CapEx in the fourth quarter increased to $2.8 billion and we finished the year at $8.9 billion, down 1.3%. In 2012, we allocated more capital to 4G LTE to expand coverage. In the fourth quarter, we also pre-positioned additional capacity in certain key markets. As more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, we expect that the continued migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower cost 4G LTE network, will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency in 2013 and beyond.In wireline, capital spending was $1.7 billion in the quarter to finish the year at $6.3 billion, down about 1%. Our balance sheet and credit metrics remained very strong. Total debt of $52 billion was down more than $3 billion or 5.7% from the end of last year. We ended the year with the net debt of $48.9 billion and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3 times. In December, we closed the pension annuitization transaction with prudential, transferring $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations by purchasing the group annuity contract. This transaction was part of an overall pension de-risking strategy which will reduce our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by changes in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risks.This transaction also provides us with additional financial flexibility. In the fourth quarter, we contributed an additional $1.7 billion in pension funding to end the year at $3.5 billion, which is in line with what I indicated on our third quarter call. Again, we do not expect any cash funding requirement for qualified pensions in 2013 and based on our current plan assumptions, we expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction.Let's move now to our summary slide. We enter 2013 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. We have great momentum in wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of devices and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and continue to differentiate ourselves with our superior internet and video services. In the enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market our strategic services, demonstrating to customers that we have a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure.In terms of our cost structure, we will continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. We continue to dedicate resources to examine all cost and processes, including product rationalization, services provisioning, back office operations and systems. Our ability to effectively execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will result in increased profitability, higher cash flows and improved earnings growth in 2013 and beyond. Lowe and I have challenged our business leaders to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we have achieved, improve our investment returns and drive significant shareholder value.With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can address your questions.John DohertyThanks Fran. Brad, let\u2019s open it up for our first question please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator instructions). Your first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman SachsThanks and good morning. Fran, maybe quick question on wireless margins and maybe just a clarification on your outlook comments. I think you said you can get back to margins that we saw in the second and third quarter of this year which was in the 49% to 50% range. Was that a full year comment or was that a 2Q and 3Q of \u201913 comment? And if it\u2019s full year, that\u2019s 200 to 300 basis points of margin expansion in wireless. Just help us think through the drivers of that. And then second, on capital spending we\u2019ve heard three of the industry peers in wireless talk about an upwards bias to CapEx as we head into 2013. At the same time, you\u2019re winding down the initial LTE build and talking about declining capital intensity. Just help us think through maybe your confidence in the ability to sustain network leadership position in wireless given that. Thanks.Fran ShammoGood morning Jason. Thanks for the question. So on the Verizon Wireless margins, that was a view of a full year range and I think that if you look at just the fundamentals of the business, I would say that our fundamentals are more sound than they were a year ago. If you look at this business, it grew EBITDA $3.2 billion or 12% and that was with a historical growth rate in the fourth quarter of this year. We gained significant market share that will carry us into next year with 5 million net adds. If you look at our ARPA growth, our ARPA growth was over $9 from a year ago and that\u2019s on a base of 35 million accounts. So the fundamentals of this business are extremely strong and I have no doubt that we will return to a margin progression of where we left the second and third quarter.On the CapEx side of the house, the guidance I would give for \u201913 is no different than what I\u2019ve said before which is we will be flat. That is in addition with all of the 4G LTE continued buildup that we have. I would tell you that we ended this year slightly higher than we probably had expected in midyear, but there were two factors for that. Number one, hurricane Sandy or Superstorm Sandy created us to incur $135 million of additional wire line capital. But in addition, we also proactively spent another $300 million on the wireless side to preposition our AWS spectrum that we originally planned for 2013 and we advanced that into 2012 and that was because we were coming off such a strong third quarter and we knew that by investing in the growth for the fourth quarter, that we were going to need to preposition this. So in essence we\u2019ve actually forward advanced some \u201913 capital. So I\u2019m very confident that we will not end up where some others will be and that our CapEx will be flat for \u201913. Thanks for the question, Jason.John DohertyThanks, Jason. Brad, let\u2019s take the next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorganThanks. First a follow up a little bit on Jason. On the wireless side, can you help us break into that 49% to 50%? Last year you talked about $2 billion cost cutting effort. Can you help us quantify that? And then second, as that leads into earnings per share growth, can you help us with a range of what EPS growth should be this year? Seems like a real acceleration is possible.Fran ShammoThanks Phil, good question. So first on the 49% to 50%, as you know over the last three years we\u2019ve taken $5 billion worth of cost structure out of wireless. We have another $2 billion of target for this year and we already have all those initiatives established for the $2 billion. Now that will happen over the course of the year. So we will continue on that. In addition, we\u2019ve also launched our Verizon Lean Six Sigma which will also contribute to the reduction of the cost structure within wireless. But also I would extend that that as we consolidate and I\u2019ll use finance as an example, as we consolidate the finance organization to the middle, we will actually take cost structure out of wireless, but we will also implement Verizon Lean Six Sigma around the entire organization and reduce the full cost of finance across the board.So again, some of the corporate Verizon Lean Six Sigma will also help reduce the cost structures of the individual units, including wireless and wire line. As far as EPS guidance, I\u2019m not going to give specific guidance today, but what I would tell you is that if you look at the first three quarters of 2012, our approximate growth was 15% year-over-year. And as I said, I am more confident in the fundamentals of this business today than I actually was a year ago. So that should give you some sense of my confidence for 2013.OperatorOur next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.John Hodulik - UBSMaybe two if I could. First, Fran, you have given some good guidance on the wireless margins and some of the consolidated. Maybe a little bit on wireline, you are going through this VES repositioning, can you talk about the progress there and maybe give us a sense for what kind of wireline margin improvement we can see on year-over-year basis? And then secondly, with the CapEx intensity coming down and some of the stuff you have done to de-risk the pension we have talked a little bit about buybacks and maybe for coming part of the discussion by the end of year, how do you feel about it given what you have seen here in 2012?Fran ShammoSo on wireline. First, I guess I want to take a few minutes on this one because obviously there is two separate components to this. One is the consumer side and then one is the enterprise side. So let\u2019s start with the consumer. Obviously, for the fourth quarter I mean consumer and wireline was significantly impacted by Sandy. And as I said on my opening remarks, it was almost impossible for us to really calculate the impact that that had.But putting that aside, I think the strength of the platforms that we have build on will continue to drive the profit of wireline. So first, copper-to-FiOS migrations, we completed 223,000 this year. Our target is 300,000 next year. This is significant reducing the cost structure of wireline from a repair perspective and as I said in opening remarks, 11% reduction for the first time in repair load from truck roll. So our strategy is working.Than we talk about the strategic pricing around FiOS. And I said a year ago that we were not disciplined around our price-ups and we started that in 2012, and as I said coming out of the third quarter, we already had our strategy laid out for \u201913. So that strategy will continue to help offset the content cost increase. In addition, FiOS quantum. If you look at what we have done over this last year, we have really solidified the strategy around speed. And what we are seeing as customers migrate from that copper and even current customers are buying up in the speeds because they realize the quality products that we have.Then if you go and look at just the union agreements and some of the pension things we did, this all culminates on the consumer side. Now, having said that, there are other things that we are investing in that put a little pressure on the wireline margin. So for instance Redbox. Redbox was a startup this year. We incurred startup costs like any startup company would. That put pressure on us in the back half of this year. Hughes, we acquired Hughes. It was a loss company. We are building back that company. They are doing an excellent job on acquiring contracts. We have one that we signed recently that will launch in the second and third quarter of this year. So we are actually adding 200 to 250 people in that business to get ready for that new auto company that we signed this agreement with in Telematics.So again, continuing to grow on that platform. VDMS is also another startup that we incurred some operating expense with no associated revenue. So when you look at Redbox, Hughes, and VDMS, these will all start to contribute to topline in wireline for 2013, but again, probably not much in the profit area. Because they are all startups and I would think that in 2014 these will really start to contribute to the overall profit. On the Verizon enterprise side, obviously my view on this one is, the best that we can hope for is flat at this time, because of all the uncertainty.Now as I said in my opening remarks, if we can get rid of some of the uncertainty around debt ceiling and deficit reduction and especially tax reform, I think this will open up for companies to start to invest again. But given that in this time of repair, we are actually building out the platforms with Terremark, and again Hughes and Verizon digital media services. So I think we are making all the right strategic moves around the product rationalization. So having all this combined, I am confident that we can improve our profit in wireline 2013 over 2012.Now on the share buyback. Given everything that we have done this year, I think we are exiting this year with a really strong balance sheet. We executed on our pension annuitization. We declined our debt by over $3 billion. We also strengthened our balance sheet from other means as well. So when you take this all in combination and the strong cash flow performance on a year over year basis even with the growth that we did in the fourth quarter and the impact of Sandy, I originally stated that share buyback would be something that we would do at the end of 2013. I am in a position now that we could do share box at any point in time right now, but I would call it an opportunistic time. So if the opportunity presents itself in our share price, then I would contemplate buying back shares. So hopefully that answers the question, John.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBSYeah. Thanks for all the detail, Fran.John DohertyThanks, John. Brad, let\u2019s take the next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan StanleyGood morning. Just a follow up on John\u2019s question there. Do you need any more authorization or how much do you currently have available if you wanted to buy back over the next few weeks? And then a couple of other cash items. Given the extra year of bonus depreciation, have you got a sense of what your cash taxes might be this year and perhaps you can update us on the 700 megahertz sale process. Thanks.Fran ShammoThanks Simon. So the first one on the cash buyback, we have a shelf registration of 100 million shares. So there\u2019s no issue there. On the second one, let me come back to that. On the 700 megahertz, we have completed some deals to date. On the side of the licenses side, we closed our deal with T-Mobile back in the third quarter of this year on the swaps. We previously agreed to sell 35 out of 77 700megahertz licenses on the B block side to 10 different purchasers and some of them are still pending at the FCC. We also agreed to sell four out of our 700megahertz A block licenses to four different purchasers and two of them are still pending at the FCC. So we continue to look at suitable deals for the others and if they come through the process, this will then take that through the regulatory process.So at this point that\u2019s where we\u2019re at. On the cash taxes, as I\u2019ve said before, this community kept questioning about the increase in my cash tax in 2013 and I kept telling everyone that we had plans in place that even with bonus deprecation going away, that would not happen. Now with bonus deprecation there, that\u2019s why I\u2019ve reflected back to the share buyback and why we\u2019re in a different position here. So I think that all ties together. But our effective tax rate for going into next year would be the same as the guidance that I gave this past year which is anywhere from 31% to 33%.Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan StanleyHelpful. Thank you.John DohertyThanks, Simon. Brad, let\u2019s take the next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment. Your line is open.Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Investment ResearchThanks. Good morning. A couple of questions. First, just the typical Verizon Wireless net debt question, if we could just get an update on that balance at the end of the year. And then secondly, as you think about the wireless margin guidance that you laid out for 2013, can you talk a little bit more about what\u2019s going on with the device replacement rate which can add some sensitivity to the margins. Do you think that will be a faster rate of replacement, same or even lower in 2013? If you could talk about some of the drivers that are contributing to that. Thanks.Fran ShammoThanks, Mike. So on the net debt side of the house, Verizon Wireless is $9.3 billion net debt. They actually have about $1.4 billion worth of debt maturing in \u201913 which we at this point plan to retire. Just on the overall handsets, this really goes I think to the question of the upgrade rate and what do we see. And again as we saw this year as I said, we would see an uptick in upgrades going into the fourth quarter from the third quarter, but we would be down from a year ago and that\u2019s exactly what happened. I would say that \u201913 is probably a flat year on an upgrade basis to this year. So I don\u2019t see any incremental increase, but it\u2019s the quality of the upgrades that we\u2019re really focused in on and if you look at the progress of basic phones, this year we had a significant amount of basic phone upgrades. So if you look at a year ago, a year ago we moved about in the fourth quarter 3.5 million basic phones. That was cut by 50% this year.So you\u2019re still going to have a population that only wants a basic phone riding off of the 3G network, but what we\u2019re seeing is as the prices of the smartphones have decreased, there\u2019s an incremental population that are coming into that smartphone category and again every single one of these adds and every single one of these upgrades, except for a few who are willing to pay full price for the smartphone, are moving into our share price plan. And as I said, 23% of our accounts now are in share pricing and you can see what\u2019s happening from a revenue increase perspective and a device attachment perspective. So again I think that from a pure upgrade perspective it\u2019s flat, but the quality of the upgrades I think just continues to get better into 2013.OperatorOur next question is from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.Mike McCormack - NomuraYeah, Fran, just not to beat a dead horse here on the full year guide, but I am assuming that you are anticipating iPhone refresh at some point in time. And then just thinking about, as we look forward over the next year or so, smartphone penetration obviously getting close to 60% now. How do we start to offset the impact of this smart to smart migration on margins generally? And I know you talked about 4G driving some additional revenue opportunity there, but how should we think about the margins longer-term as we get smartphone penetration reaching, let\u2019s call it 80%, and then we are seeing much more of the smart to smart to impact.Fran ShammoThanks, Mike. I guess the way I look at this is, is that there is more to this than just the smartphone category. So if you look at, again, of what we are doing with shared and the increase of the revenue and the attachment of other devices. So if you look at our internet device category including the tablets, we had one of our strongest quarters from another device attachment rate than we have had in the past. This all drives the revenue. So when you think about the increase in the service revenue side because this does not go with just concentrating on the subsidy of the handset. Because the subsidy of the handset although higher than a basic phone would be, these drive incremental revenues from usage perspective. And especially when you have a platform like the LTE with the speed and the video consumption that people are using and the buying up of the tiers that they have.And then you think about machine to machine and the opportunities for mobile payments and other solutions that are going to ride off of the Hughes platform. We have many, many opportunity to offset the subsidy with the incremental revenue. Now having said that, on the subsidy side of the house, you can see that the price of the handsets continued to decline. We now have the Windows platform in our mix and we saw some steady albeit slow increase in some of the uptake of that platform. But as we get more and more platforms in the mix and now we have RIM out there again, there is going to be incremental competition, there will be subsidy reduction as there was in the basic phone history in the ecosystem.So again, this is full management of the P&L. This is just not locking in one item on the P&L. And if you can culminate that with the $5 billion reduction in cost and then the other $2 billion that we have this year, again, I am very very confident in the fundamentals and the trajectory that we have going into 2013.Mike McCormack - NomuraFran, what was the initial impact on the pool data plans? I think you guys had anticipated some potential risk of dilution there. What was the initial experience for those that are signing up?Fran ShammoMike, can you just -- I think we missed the front end of that question. Could you just restate it please?Mike McCormack - NomuraJust the pool data plans. I think you guys had talked initially about some potential early dilution when you switched over those plans. I am just trying to get a sense for what the early experience has been.Fran ShammoYeah, the early adaptors, Mike, obviously were in fact dilutive. But it wasn\u2019t as much as we had expected. And if you look at the ARPA growth that we are generating now, it actually is way offsetting any of that initial dilution. So we are in a very good place with the shared price plan.OperatorOur next question is from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.Kevin Smithen - MacquarieCan you discuss how you evaluate various uses of free cash flow with spectrum purchases last year, CapEx flat and tackling the pension. Looks like you have a lot more free cash flow this year. You have talked about the buyback but you have also mentioned some cloud, video wireline growth initiatives, potentially raising the dividend. Or would you say powder for Vodafone or other wireless M&A. How do you balance all those out and should we think about a little bit of all of them or the focus on the buyback, given where the stock is right now.Fran ShammoKevin, I think you answered the question. All encompassing in your answer. But, look, I think it\u2019s all of the above. Again, I think we left this year in a very, very good solid place. We bought spectrum last year, we bought Hughes last year, we made some significant investments. We continue to invest in that Redbox platform, the Hughes platform, as we acquired it. We continue to build out the Terremark asset that we acquired over a year and half ago. So it\u2019s all of the above. And share buyback, dividend policy, deleveraging, is all encompassed in that strategy. So again, I think you answered the question given everything you said.OperatorOur next question is from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open.Tom Seitz - JefferiesOne on wireline and one on wireless, if I could. On wireline, can you help us think about the impact to wireline margins of the copper migration over time? Texas is one of the oldest FiOS markets and I believe you\u2019ve said in the past that video and internet penetrations there are in the high 40% range. You already had the more favorable union contract down there, more forward looking state regulatory environment. Are margins in Texas better by a few basis points or are they on order of magnitude better? Any framing you could do in that area would be great. And then on the wireless side, BlackBerry 10 launches this quarter. You just mentioned it. It\u2019s reported to be another expensive device. When you look at your BlackBerry base, is there any chance at all that this handset has an unusual impact to the first quarter or second quarter that could impede the improvement you outlined? And if you can indulge me, any view your product guys have on RIM becoming the third competitive OS now that they\u2019ve seen the device?Fran ShammoThanks Tom. So on the Texas market, I\u2019m not going to specifically speak to any individual market of FiOS. It\u2019s not a good thing for me to do that at this point in time. But what I would tell you is that it is the highest penetration of our market. It is a very profitable market. So given where we are in Texas which was the first market we launched, we know that the rest of the markets can achieve those types of penetration rates which we\u2019re in the 50%. So there\u2019s no stopping us from a penetration rate and as we continue and you saw this quarter, we had a higher demand for the FiOS product and some of that was because quite honestly, Superstorm Sandy showed the reliability of the fiber network even in this type of a catastrophe. Copper does not mix with water. Fiber optics doesn\u2019t care if it\u2019s in water.So again the strength of how we build our reliable network with generator backup and all sorts of things just speaks to the popularity of this product. So I think that we\u2019re in a good position going into \u201913 overall with FiOS and I will tell you that year over year, FiOS continues to become more of a profitable product for us. So I\u2019ll answer it that way. On the BlackBerry 10 launch, given your question, no, I don\u2019t anticipate any unusual item that would cause me to come off of the statement that I made earlier. This is just yet another platform. We are hoping that the platform is successful. We have very loyal BlackBerry users in our base and we\u2019ll see how that goes. But all in we now have four operating platforms coming into the mix and again as I said before, I think more choice for our customers is better for us and for the consumer and for competition.Tom Seitz \u2013 JefferiesThanks Fran.John DohertyBrad, we have time for two more questions.OperatorOur next question is from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill LynchHey guys. Thanks very much. Welcome Mike. Just wanted to ask two if I could. Number one, Fran, on the upper growth that you saw, could you give us a sense as to the mix of the drivers in the growth year over year? Is it the volume coming from the Tablets connected devices and people coming from handsets to smartphones? Or with respect to the upgrade in the data plans, has that become a driver that you can quantify and grab onto yet? And then I guess the second question would be, as you have talked about starting to harvest the 3G network capacity, could you talk about how aggressive you plan on being in terms of trying to monetize the capacity that you have as customers move from 3G to 4G? I\u2019d imagine that there\u2019s a lot of opportunity to especially get more aggressive in the prepaid side of the equation. Thanks.Fran ShammoThanks David. So on the ARPA growth, it's a combination of a lot of things. Obviously it's the \u2013 as we said, based on our view of when we launched this plan, we expected the uptake in the data consumption based on the LTE network and the speeds that that network can deliver. So as people consume more they will buy up in the tiers. And then in addition, it's the device attachment and this one is really considerable for us, because that's why we developed the plan we did and you can attach up to 10 devices. And what we're seeing is, as we said in the outset here, if 30% of these customers coming to us on smartphones are new to Verizon and what we see is that they come in at the low end of the devices onto the share price plan, and over a period of six-months they almost double the amount of devices that they put on the plan. So the device attachment, whether it's a tablet or a MiFi card, we launched a camera in the fourth quarter, so all these things will contribute to the attachment which will drive usage and then hence drives the ARPA increase. And then on to 3G network, yes, we stopped investing in that network. We obviously continued to sell the 3G iPhones on that network, which were very successful in the fourth quarter. So, again, we managed this network very closely. But look, I mean we made some moves in 2012 around prepaid and we will see where we go in 2013 but we will continue to utilize that network to contribute to the bottomline of the company.OperatorOur last question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells FargoJust following up on David\u2019s question on the capacity. On the LTE coverage given it\u2019s almost complete, when will we see you adding more LTE capacity kind of through the lining up of spectrum, AWS spectrum that you got from the cable companies. And if you just....Fran ShammoSo we actually did pre-position, as I said this year we pre-positioned $300 million of capital to start positioning that AWS spectrum for capacity around LTE in some of the major markets. And that really was a result of our exiting the third quarter and the growth that we saw. And knowing that we were strategically going into and investing in the growth of the fourth quarter. So given all that we did pre-position the AWS spectrum and we will continue to do that as needed. So we are in a very good position with our LTE network. We are in a very good position with our license holding. So no issues at this point.Okay. So thank you everyone. Let me just close this real quick. First, just thank you for joining the call today, but also I wanted to just say thank you to John for his diligence here in the IR role and I wish him luck in his new mergers and acquisition, and business development role here at Verizon. And I take the opportunity to welcome Mike Stefanski to the team. So thank you again for joining the call and I look forward to speaking to each of you.John DohertyThanks, Fran.

Thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny ", "Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website.", "This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. ", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. ", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. ", "Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I\u2019d like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter. ", "Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.37. Adjusted earnings, or EPS before the effects of special items, were $0.62. We are excluding the following special items from adjusted results. ", "The first is a $477 million after-tax charge, or $0.16 per share for severance and other related expenses. These costs are being recognized as a result of work force reductions which began in the fourth quarter and will continue throughout 2008. The charge is associated with the reduction of approximately 9,000 employees. Nearly 4,000 were in the fourth quarter of 2007 and the remainder will be during 2008. ", "Next is a $139 million, or $0.05 per share charge for additional taxes and related expenses associated with an increase in the distributable earnings from Vodafone Omnitel. ", "We are also excluding a $36 million after-tax charge, or $0.01 per share, for non-operational costs incurred in connection with the spin-off of access lines in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. These costs are mostly related to network, software, and other activities which will enable the impacted facilities and systems to function on a standalone basis. ", "The last item is a $58 million after-tax charge, or $0.02 per share, for merger integration costs. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "Thanks, Ron and good morning, everyone. The fourth quarter capped a year of very strong performance and momentum as all key strategic areas of growth did well. One of our objectives in 2007 was to noticeably increase shareowner value by accelerating growth. Top line growth improved to 5.8% compared with 3.3% pro forma growth in 2006. We also focused on productivity and margin improvements. ", "Both operating income and EBITDA margins expanded over last year. Operating income increased $2.5 billion, or 17.9%. As for earnings, we posted double-digit growth in adjusted EPS from continuing operations. ", "Our $0.62 compares with $0.52 a year ago, up 19.2%. We finished the year at $2.36 per share, up 15.1% from 2006. In September, we announced a dividend increase of 6.2%, or $0.10 per share per year, a clear indication of the confidence we have in our cash outlook, and we\u2019ve continued to repurchase shares. ", "In the fourth quarter, we repurchased more than $1.1 billion of our common stock, bringing our 2007 total to more than $2.8 billion. Over the last two years, our stock buy-back program has totaled $4.5 billion and at current prices, we will continue to be buyers of our stock. ", "Our strong performance in 2007 reflects our commitment to investors to accelerate growth, expand margins, and create shareowner value. ", "On slide four, you can see that fourth quarter revenues increased to $23.8 billion, up 5.6% year over year. For the full year 2007, consolidated revenues totaled $93.5 billion, an increase of $5.2 billion, or 250 basis points of incremental growth. ", "In addition to these revenue gains, our focus on cost reductions and several ongoing productivity initiatives helped improve margins. Our fourth quarter operating margin of 18.2% represents a 200 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year. EBITDA margin of 33.5% was also up 110 basis points compared with fourth quarter last year. For the full year, operating income margin expanded 180 basis points. So good progress at the margin, with profitable revenue growth in both wireline and wireless segments. ", "Turning to cash flows, we received a net $2.1 billion in dividends from Vodafone Omnitel in December. This helped cash flows from continuing operations to reach $26.3 billion for 2007, an increase of 14.2%. We finished the year with just over $31 billion in debt, paying down more than $5 billion during 2007. ", "Capital expenditures for 2007 came in at $17.5 billion. Wireline spending was just under $11 billion and wireless was $6.5 billion, and our ratio of CapEx to revenue improved to 18.8%. ", "Our balance sheet is as strong as it\u2019s ever been, so let\u2019s look now at our segment results, beginning with Verizon Wireless on slide six. ", "In wireless, we had another strong quarter of customer growth with 2 million total net adds, 1.9 million of which were retail. We ended the year with a customer base that is 97% retail, reflecting our continued focus on this market. Eighty-seven percent, or 1.65 million of the retail net adds in the quarter, were postpaid. We now have 61 million retail postpaid customers. ", "Our industry leading churn rates continue to be excellent. Total churn was 1.2% and retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, so a very strong year of customer growth with 6.9 million retail net adds, and 6.3 million retail postpaid. ", "Turning to slide seven, total service revenues were up 13.7% in the fourth quarter and nearly 16% for the full year. Retail service revenues grew 14.4% this quarter as retail service ARPU increased 1.4% to $51.49. ", "For the full year, retail service ARPU grew 2.2%. Data revenues represented 21.3% of total service revenue in the quarter, as compared to 15.8% a year ago. We saw wireless data revenues grow $2.9 billion, or 65% in 2007. In 2007, retail data ARPU increased 44% or $3.09 per user. Retail data ARPU in the fourth quarter was $11.06. We see enormous potential for growth in wireless data for years to come. ", "With our national 3G network and track record of innovation and industry first, we are well-positioned to take advantage of this huge growth opportunity. ", "In summary, Verizon Wireless continues to lead the industry in retail customers, total revenue, customer loyalty, and profitability. ", "Wireless revenues of just under $44 billion, which represents 47% of total Verizon revenues, grew 15.3% in 2007. Half of this annual growth was from data. In fact, about 74% of our retail customers are data users. ", "Most important, we\u2019ve sustained our track record of profitable growth. 2007 EBITDA grew $2.4 billion, or 16.8%, and EBITDA margin expanded 30 basis points to 44.6%. We have a proven business model. These results are further evidence of great execution, sustainable growth, and strong cash generation. ", "Within wireline, our strategic products also showed impressive growth in 2007. On the consumer side, I\u2019m pleased to announce that we now have more than 1 million FiOS TV customers. ", "As you can see on slide nine, we added 226,000 net new FiOS TV customers in the fourth quarter, ending 2007 with 943,000 subscribers and a penetration rate of 16%. At the end of the year, we were marketing FiOS TV service to about 5.9 million homes, up 1.2 million from the end of third quarter. Almost half of the increase at homes open for sale came in December. ", "Total broadband subscribers, DSL plus FiOS Internet, increased to 8.2 million, up 1.2 million or 18% from a year ago. During the quarter, we added 245,000 net new FiOS Internet customers and 19,000 net DSL subscribers for a total of 264,000 net broadband adds. We now have more than 1.5 million FiOS Internet subscribers representing 21% penetration of the 7.5 million homes open for sale. ", "Retail residential line loss of 616,000 in the quarter showed some improvement from last quarter and was about the same as the fourth quarter a year ago. We continue to see an increasing correlation between the availability of FiOS TV and improved line retention. At the end of the year, almost 80% of the 7.5 million FiOS homes open for sale could also subscribe to our video service. ", "Clearly our consumer retail business is increasingly centered on broadband, video, and bundles. As shown on slide 10, our legacy consumer revenue growth was 2.7% for the fourth quarter and the full year, a significant improvement from negative growth this time a year ago. ", "Increases in broadband and video revenue have driven consumer retail ARPU to $59.48, an increase of 11% year over year. All of our regional markets had ARPU accretion in 2007. Our strategy of investment and innovation is clearly driving consumer revenue growth. ", "Now let\u2019s take a look at Verizon business. In this market, we continue to see strong demand for data services. Total Verizon business revenues grew 0.5% for the fourth quarter, and 1.8% for the full year. The fourth quarter was disproportionately impacted by some customers moving traffic off of our network and some contract timing issues. However, we are confident in our ability to overcome these effects and expect revenue growth to be back on trend within the first half of 2008. ", "Our strategic services, which represent about 27% of total Verizon business, sustained strong revenue growth trends, increasing both sequentially and year over year. Here, our fourth quarter and full year revenue growth exceeds 25%. Growth was once again driven by Private IP, managed services, and security. ", "Looking at total wireline on slide 12, we continue to see revenue and margin improvement. In 2006, revenues declined nearly $2.9 billion, or 5.3%. In 2007, revenues declined $639 million, or 1.3%. This improvement was driven by growth in Verizon business as we continue to win new business and compete successfully as the transition to IP continues for large enterprise customers. ", "We also saw growth in small and medium business as legacy revenues topped $5 billion for the year and grew 3.6%. Within wholesale, special access revenues of $4 billion grew 4.1%, and on the residential side, even though line losses continue, we successfully increased revenue per customer, which resulted in improved legacy consumer revenue growth. ", "As in wireless, data services are a big driver of wireline revenue growth. Data in the fourth quarter represented 38% of total wireline revenue and grew nearly 12% for the year. ", "In terms of improving profitability, we are making good progress. Fourth quarter wireline operating income margins expanded 80 basis points year over year and 30 basis points sequentially to 9.7%. Estimated earnings dilution from FiOS was $0.09 in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year total to $0.39. We\u2019ve seen improvements in customer acceptance rates, capital unit cost trends, and installation productivity. ", "While we continue to focus on driving top line and ARPU growth, we are equally focused on reducing costs across the entire business. We want to make sure that revenue growth and increased efficiencies continue to result in improved profitability and margins. ", "When looking at our cost profile, one of the big categories is obviously the employee workforce. As shown on slide 13, we\u2019ve steadily reduced wireline headcount by about 12,000 over the past two years. Ron mentioned severance associated with forced reductions that started in late 2007 and will continue throughout 2008. ", "As we look further out in the planning period, we see opportunities for ongoing force reductions. We also continue to see additional cost reduction opportunities through system consolidations by moving to common platforms and by innovations in the area of customer self-service. Both Denny and I remain very bullish about our opportunities to achieve incremental cost savings throughout the business. ", "So as we close the book on 2007, I\u2019d say we made great progress and delivered very strong financial and operating performance. But as a management team, we recognize there is much more to do. We are in aggressive pursuit of a number of revenue growth opportunities. Our network capabilities and the strength of our products and services position us well to sustain our growth momentum. ", "In wireless, our business plan targets continued double-digit revenue growth and in wireline, revenue growth will continue to improve. ", "As I said, we are equally focused on productivity and operating efficiency, which provide opportunities for margin expansion. In wireless, we continue to see service EBITDA margins in the range of 43% to 45%. In wireline, we are striving for continued margin improvement. Our goal is to expand wireline EBITDA margins targeting a range of 30% to 33%. ", "We will continue investing in the networks and new technologies to provide the platform for growth, innovation, and productivity. For 2008, we are targeting capital spending to be below this year\u2019s number of $17.5 billion, and we\u2019ve set targets for wireline and wireless that are slightly lower than 2007. ", "Before we get to your questions, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation about the potential impact of an economic slowdown. I would say that we have not seen a change in sales expectations through January. Obviously we are monitoring numerous metrics very closely and at this point, we don\u2019t see any material changes. ", "We expect 2008 to be a solid year. We are targeting another year of meaningful earnings growth and growth in operating income margins. Our cash flow projections provide for continued network investment and the ability to pay a competitive dividend. And we will also continue to regard share repurchases as a prudent use of cash. ", "In summary, we are very confident in our outlook for 2008 and the ability to deliver strong results and create shareowner value. ", "With that, I will turn it back to Ron. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Denny and Doreen are now available to take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from John Hodulik with UBS. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "", "Two quick ones; first, on the FiOS homes passed, the 9.3 million is a little bit more than I think you guys had targeted. Could you talk a little bit about \u201908 and what the plans are there?", "And second of all, the wireline margins were also a little bit better than we thought and then, I think the guidance you guys just talked about, 30% to 33% -- first of all, could you talk about over what timeframe you expect to get to those levels and what the cause of the strength was in the fourth quarter here?", "Doreen A. Toben", "I think if I take them in reverse order, the wireline 30% to 33%, I would say that\u2019s over the planning period, which I would say is three to five years from that perspective. ", "As far as why the margins kicked up, I think clearly a lot of the people went off in the fourth quarter. They went off late third quarter, into the fourth quarter so the biggest bump of headcount really came in the fourth quarter. We were also able to do some things. We had outsourced EDS last year and we really started to get the bulk of those benefits in the fourth quarter because it was much higher last year, so those really have come down. ", "And just continued emphasis on cost reductions, and I think Denny\u2019s talked about before, in some of our centralized organizations has really started to kick in. We\u2019ve seen some of the synergies in Verizon business really start to help us, so they have been on the right trajectory for continued margin improvement as we go into \u201908. ", "And on the FiOS homes passed, I think -- ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Three million more this year. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "", "Okay, great. Off of the 9.3, I take it? Sounds great. Thanks.", "", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from David Janazzo with Merrill Lynch.", "David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch", "Doreen, you mentioned the economy and looking at numerous metrics. Can you review with us what those metrics are? And versus history, I mean, the business mix is a little bit different now -- no more directories, obviously more wireless and wireless substitution. How do you think about the response of the business in the future versus some of the historical measures?", "Doreen A. Toben", "Okay, David. As you would imagine, I have been all over this for months, so on a daily basis I look at wireless sales, wireless disconnects, net adds, and churn, all by region, so very localized. For wireline, I look at access lines, I look at broadband, FiOS DSL, FiOS TV, all also by region and enterprise, I look at sales. ", "On more of a weekly/monthly basis, where I\u2019ve been really looking hard is what you expect the discretionary services, so if I look at wireless, what are the ringtones doing, what is music doing, what is games doing? If I look at FiOS, I\u2019m looking at the premium channels, the VODs, the DVRs. Broadband, I\u2019m looking at speed. ", "By the way, I\u2019ll get to the trends in a second but just to mention, we went live with some self-provisioning on our remote shortly and the premium channel take-up has really increased, so really good trends. ", "And then, both wireline and wireless, of course I\u2019m looking at the write-offs, I\u2019m looking at bad debt, disconnects, non-pay, the percent that the collection agencies are actually collecting, CPE sales, and of course volumes of DS1s and DS3s. ", "And then externally what I try to do is I look at housing starts, mortgage delinquencies, unemployment, and then I actually do sort of a running regression to see which are the most impactful, and then competitive activity.", "So if I put all that together and say what do I see, I really don\u2019t see much trend change at all for us, including through January. A real small pocket of one or two states in the Midwest where I see some impact having to do with the economy. Very small numbers of lines for us in those states, so not impactful at all. Not really seeing anything in any of the urban areas. I have seen a small impact on, and Denny mentioned this previously, on Verizon Wireless and the over 90-day on collectibles. Still very low, below 2% but some impact. ", "But I think the point of your question was right -- our base has really changed. So we have a lot more customers now under contract than we ever had. From the enterprise side, we have much more international exposure. Typically we would have seen the first impact years gone past in directory on non-pay but we don\u2019t really have directory anymore. Our wireless customers are always the highest credit standards, the need for broadband continues, so to say I\u2019m looking at this on a daily basis is absolutely accurate and not seeing trend changes, so I\u2019m encouraged by that. ", "David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch", "And just to comment maybe on some of the FiOS markets, particularly the FiOS video market versus a non-FiOS market?", "Doreen A. Toben", "The FiOS markets are clearly stronger from that perspective. As far as when I look at access lines and the trends at access lines, it is absolutely clear that FiOS is impactful. However, even looking at areas of non-FiOS, we\u2019re still not seeing a change in trend but FiOS is clearly helpful. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "I would add to what Doreen has said here that if we did see an impact developing on the business, I believe that we can take steps to avoid any material disruptions. For example, we can make adjustments to the force, overtime levels, consulting and contractor expenses, travel and so on. ", "The point is that I think Doreen and I remain very confident about 2008 despite all of the noise we are hearing about the economy. ", "David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from David Barden with Banc of America. ", "David Barden - Banc of America ", "Just maybe two, first on wireless; obviously there\u2019s a growing sense that as we get north of the 80% penetration rate in wireless that the quality of the incremental subscribers is going to decline and to the extent that the industry\u2019s been feasting on Sprint a little bit, that that might moderate or diminish this year. ", "I noticed 16% of the net adds were, retail net adds were prepay this quarter and I was wondering if you could kind of just speak to the general mix of how you see volume and ARPUs driving revenues in \u201908 versus \u201907. ", "And then the second on the wireline margin, I\u2019m assuming we\u2019re still targeting EBITDA positive on FiOS this year. If you marry that with the headcount cuts, presupposing that the overall wireline climate doesn\u2019t deteriorate, we should be looking for some reasonable tick-up in wireline margins in \u201908. I was wondering if you could kind of put some parameters around that and maybe talk about how pensions might affect that in \u201908 too, Doreen. Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Let me start on the wireless side and then turn it over to Doreen. First of all, yes, 80% penetration levels in wireless. We continue to expect to take a disproportionate share of the industry gross adds over the planning period. Our focus is on revenue growth and maintaining industry-leading margins. ", "Relative to prepaid, our focus has always been on the retail post-paid market. However, we have seen more adds coming from prepay. We enhanced our own prepaid products late last year and we expect continued strength in retail postpaid and some increase on the prepaid side of the business. ", "I think looking at ARPU, our ARPU has been driven in large part by growth in data revenues and our retail data ARPU grew 44% in 2007. And our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to see some strong data growth going forward into \u201908, so that\u2019s the data side, the wireless side of the business. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "On the wireline margin, yes, we are -- I am still confident that we\u2019ll be EBITDA positive in \u201908. In fact, we have at least one or two states that are EBITDA positive now, those that have been around longer, so we feel good about that. ", "Other than to tell you the target is sort 30% to 33% and I feel confident that we will have improvement next year, I\u2019m not going to give you a pinpoint number. ", "On the pension and OPEB, expect it to be relatively flat year. There will be some medical costs that will tick up so that -- basically pension and OPEB you should plan to be relatively flat. ", "David Barden - Banc of America ", "Okay, guys. Thanks for that. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Michael Rollins with Citigroup. ", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup", "Just a couple of questions; first, I was wondering if you could give us a little more detail on what\u2019s happening with DSL, especially outside of the FiOS markets and what we should expect on that front for 2008. ", "And Denny, just a quick clarification; a few weeks ago you mentioned that the long-term wireline OIBDA margin could approach 33% to 34%, which is the higher end of the range that you guys provided this morning. So is that still the long-term goal for OIBDA margins or do you see a need to take that long-term goal in a little bit? Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Michael, we continue to see that as the long-term goal, yes. On the DSL side, if you look at the combined net adds for DSL, FiOS Internet, and FiOS TV, the net add numbers are fairly constant, about 490,000. What\u2019s changed is the mix, which reflects our investment and the marketing focus that we\u2019ve had over the last year. You see some DSL migration to FiOS Internet. You also see DSL migration to wireless broadband and churn incidentally has actually remained fairly constant. DSL subs actually grew 6.5% in \u201907 and revenue grew nearly 14%. So I don\u2019t see these dynamics changing going forward. ", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Mike McCormack with Bear Stearns. ", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "A couple of things; on the enterprise side, it looked like the year-over-year rate of growth slowed pretty dramatically and I know at least historically, fourth quarter is typically a pretty tough quarter for that. I\u2019m just wondering if it\u2019s typical seasonal patterns or whether you are seeing something else there.", "And secondly on -- the primary voice lines continue to deteriorate and you had another fairly bad quarter on primary lines. I\u2019m just wondering when we\u2019re going to start to see the impact of FiOS line retention on some of those primary line counts. Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "First, looking at the enterprise side, our enterprise sales momentum actually is continuing to be very strong and actually what occurred in the fourth quarter was frankly kind of annoying to me. We did not offset the take-back fast enough. This is a timing issue. The lower growth number this quarter really shouldn\u2019t be interpreted as a shift in the structure of the business. All traffic from these few primary, major customers that we lost will be gone within the first half of the year. We expect revenue growth to be back on trend within the first half of the year as we grow through the loss. Incidentally, one of the losses was a large cable company, so no surprise there. ", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Denny, could you give us a sense -- I think that was on the wholesale side. I was looking more --", "Dennis F. Strigl", "-- million dollars in the first half of \u201907 and the fourth quarter growth would have been 1.2% excluding that issue. ", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Hey, Denny -- ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "By the way, if you look at our enterprise customer base, all-in with international revenues, for example, our revenue grew 2.4% in the fourth quarter. ", "On the line loss, I\u2019d just simply say my goal is to retain as many customers as possible. We\u2019re not seeing any change in the macro drivers, technology substitution, or competition. A very competitive marketplace and as I think you know, as we are more successful, we\u2019re more successful actually in retaining customers where we have FiOS TV, so as we expand the availability of FiOS it should help our retention. ", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "If you could just pull apart the VZ business revenue, I think we understood the wholesale pressures but it looked like the retail enterprise also had a deceleration in growth. Is that just typical seasonal patterns?", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Yeah, the cable was in enterprise. ", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thanks. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Tom Sykes with Lehman Brothers. ", "Tom Sykes - Lehman Brothers", "SME still grew around 3.6% but DSL, I guess particularly out of the FiOS region, continues to be somewhat de-emphasized so I\u2019m wondering, given the economy, what\u2019s driving that growth? Is FiOS having an impact on SME? And given the softening economy generally impacts small business first, can you give us any trends in that area?", "And then I was wondering if you could update us on any progress you might have made with some of the big metropolitan areas. There were some press reports regarding FiOS in New York City and any update there would be appreciated. Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "I think both questions are very closely related. FiOS is helping us in the small business market, yes, but not to any great extent at this point. Relative to the MDUs, as we put in place more big city franchises, you will see us passing more multiple dwelling units. That will help on the small business side as well as just the typical apartment housing and so forth. ", "Where do we stand in that regard? You will see in the course of 2008 that we will have a few major cities where we expect to have franchises granted. This will have an impact toward the end of \u201908 and into the \u201909 year. We think we\u2019ve got some very good opportunity in the MDU market place. This will also help us significantly on the cost side. ", "Tom Sykes - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Tom. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Gabedi - Morgan Stanley", "This is actually Daniel [Gabedi] on behalf of Simon. My question is on broadband penetration. What\u2019s your estimate of broadband penetration of households in your major markets and how much more room for growth is there? And if you could also talk about any plans to boost speeds of DSL in non-FiOS markets? Thank you. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "I think if you look at broadband penetration of those homes that have a PC and those that are broadband, using broadband, it\u2019s really close to 75%, so we think that there\u2019s a relatively high penetration already of broadband. ", "And then as far as doing higher speeds of DSL, yes, we are actually looking at that. We\u2019ve made some announcements of doing 7-meg so we\u2019re rolling that out this year -- well, actually, we rolled out last year. We are rolling out more of it this year because we do think it\u2019s important to kick up the speeds of DSL. ", "Daniel Gabedi - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Daniel. Operator, this will be our last question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your final question is from Chris Larsen with Credit Suisse.", "Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse ", "I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about the FiOS, the installation trends, both in costs and lead times, and then maybe the demands for services as it relates to the free TV offer that you had in the fourth quarter and maybe some thoughts going into \u201908 for those install times. ", "And then secondly on the FairPoint transaction, if you could just give us an update on timing and I know that there\u2019s been some request for less debt -- if you could give us an idea of what the expected impact and your relative ability to delever off that transaction is. Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Chris, let me take the FiOS part of this and we have made some significant progress throughout the course of \u201907. In fact, we eliminated two to three hours off the installed time during the year. I\u2019m still not satisfied with that but I\u2019m confident that we can be more efficient, both from a time-to-install productivity overall on FiOS, so I think we have some good upside in that regard. ", "I\u2019m at this point happy with the FiOS TV and Internet volumes that we experienced in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve made some steady progress in reducing our overall costs and again, we expect to be able to continue that into \u201908. ", "During the fourth quarter, we did allow more overtime to meet the heavy customer demand that we experienced. Of course, that was our choice. The impact of the free TV offer during the quarter was really not material to our overall costs. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "And then on FairPoint, I think we were expecting it to close first quarter still and the de-levering is about maybe $300 million, so not a huge number for the total transaction.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Verizon\u2019s Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Ron Lataille", "Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to our third quarter 2006 earnings conference call.  Thanks for joining us this morning.  I am Ron Lataille.  With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and CEO; and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the Investor Relations website.  This call is being webcast, and if you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. ", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement.  Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained within this presentation and is also contained in our SEC filings which are available on our website. ", "This presentation also contain certain non-GAAP financial measures as defined under the SEC rules. We have provided reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures on the same web page as our presentation slides. ", "Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I would like to provide an update on a few items and cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings. ", "First, in mid-October the board approved the proposed spin-off of our domestic directory business to our shareholders.  The spin-off will result in a new public company called Idearc which will trade on the New York Stock Exchange following the spin-off under the symbol IAR.  A November 1, 2006 record date has been established for the spin-off, along with a distribution ratio of one Idearc share for every 20 Verizon shares. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, distribution of shares is scheduled to occur on, or about, November 17. ", "As you know, the recently adopted pension accounting pronouncement FAS 158 will be effective December 31, 2006.  FAS 158 requires the recognition of the funded status of defined benefit plans as either an asset or a liability on the balance sheet. Based on our current estimates, we expect to decrease shareowners equity by approximately $10 billion post-tax.  There is no impact to cash or earnings as a result of the adoption of this change.  Additional information on FAS 158 will be included in our third quarter 10-Q.", "I also want to make sure you are aware of one other item which is included in our equity and earnings of unconsolidated businesses line. During the third quarter, we recognized an $85 million favorable tax benefit from Vodafone Omnitel.  Now, as far as our third quarter results, reported earnings per diluted share were $0.66.  On an adjusted basis, before the effects of special items, EPS was $0.68.  The special items that make up the difference between reported and adjusted EPS are discussed in our earnings release and provided in reconciliation tables in the investor quarterly bulletin. ", "Briefly, there are three special items which we are excluding from adjusted results:", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. ", "Doreen Toben", "Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone.  Let me start by saying that we had another strong quarter as both wireless and wireline continued to perform well and contributed to our objective of creating long-term growth. Each of our three network platforms are focused on delivering quality, growth and creating long-term value.  ", "Verizon Wireless continues to grow. Its high performance, organic growth model demonstrates the long-term benefits of a deep and profitable relationship with our customers. In the quarter, revenue growth exceeded 18%.  We added 2 million retail customers and also increased service ARPU.  ", "Our investments in the wireline business are creating the same foundation for long-term growth. We are building new customer relationships through our broadband initiatives.  We now have 522,000 FiOS data customers and 118,000 FiOS video customers. The increase in FiOS data customers drove another excellent quarter for total broadband performance.  Between DSL and FiOS data, we generated 448,000 net adds this quarter. ", "In the enterprise business market, we continue to see major contract wins and renewals as we expand and deepen our relationships with customers. Revenues from key strategic services like IP and managed services grew 25% and helped drive our second straight quarter of sequential growth.  ", "Okay. Let's turn to slide 4 and look at some of the details.  Total revenues were up 25.8% versus the year-ago quarter, a comparison that is favorably affected by the inclusion of MCI this year.  Throughout the rest of the discussion, when I refer to year-over-year comparisons, they will be on a pro forma basis unless otherwise noted. ", "Consolidated revenue growth was 3.6% year-over-year and 2.5% sequentially.  Revenue increases were once again driven by growth in wireless, broadband and enterprise data services. Operating income increased 6.6% and operating income margins increased 50 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, these results include the effect of net pensions and OPEB which amounted to $332 million in the third quarter and slightly higher than last year. Also remember that we do not exclude the effects of amortization of intangibles from our adjusted results. The amount of amortization expense related to the acquisition of MCI is about $210 million annually and is $53 million this quarter.  Our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.68 per share. ", "Looking at our cash flows and balance sheet, we continue to have very strong cash generation.  On a year-to-date basis, CFFO for our continuing operations totaled $17.9 billion, $2.9 billion higher than the same period last year. Year-to-date capital spending was $12.3 billion, of which $7.3 billion is wireline and $4.8 billion is wireless. We continue to maintain out stated guidance for full-year CapEx spending.  ", "Debt was $41.7 billion at September 30, and all our credit metrics remain strong. ", "Let's turn now to the wireline financials on slide 6.  Revenues were up sequentially for the second quarter in a row and continue to show steady improvement year over year.  On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenues were down 4.7%, which is better than the 6.2% decline in the second quarter and the 6.8% decline in the first quarter. So we are definitely seeing an improvement in the top line.  ", "In addition to our focus on improving the top line, we are equally focused on the expense side.  Third quarter cash expenses declined 1.3% year over year; excluding FiOS, cash expenses decreased by $350 million, or 3.8% year over year.  Our goal is to offset FiOS expenses with reductions in the core business. You can see from our results that wireline margins were sequentially lower in the third quarter, primarily due to access line losses and increased FiOS dilution. ", "FiOS represented $0.09 of total earnings dilution this quarter, up $0.02 from the second quarter.  This incremental dilution was driven by strong customer growth and higher video cost.  At this point, we expect full-year FiOS earnings dilution to be about $0.31 to $0.32 per share, which is about $0.02 higher than our previous guidance.  As a result, we are expecting fourth quarter wireline margins to reflect these changes. ", "In addition to our continued focus on reducing costs in the traditional telecom business, we will also see increasing flow through of cost savings in the large enterprise market.  While only nine months into our integration of MCI, we are on track with our plans and are already seeing significant operational benefits.  When we complete the billing and other system conversions, we will see additional cost synergies. Going forward, we continue to see significant opportunities for wireline cost savings.  ", "A big driver of the underlying revenue growth comes from data.  This data transformation is improving our revenue mix and creating higher value, more retentive customers, both residential and business.  Data is becoming more significant and now represents 32% of total wireline revenues.  ", "Quarterly data revenues totaled $4.1 billion, up 6.3% year-over-year and 3% sequentially.  Within telecom, data growth is driven by the strong demand for broadband in the consumer and small business markets, as well as continued, healthy demand for high-speed, high capacity services in the wholesale market.  Total mass market broadband subscribers now total 6.6 million with more than 6 million DSL customers and 522,000 FiOS data subs. ", "In Verizon business, quarterly data revenues totaled $2.6 billion, $1.1 billion of which comprises what we call \u201cstrategic services\u201d.  These revenues, which include Internet, IP, private IP, various management services such as network solutions and Ethernet and ring services, grew nearly 25% since last year and are up 5% sequentially. ", "The next chart is a closer look at telecom revenues. The most encouraging news here is that consumer retail revenues, excluding mass-market MCI, increased sequentially for the first time since the second quarter of last year, due primarily to broadband growth. On a year-over-year basis, third quarter revenues were down 3.3%, which is an improvement from the 4% decline in the second quarter. Also encouraging is the fact that average revenue per household per month has increased more than 2% sequentially and year over year, providing evidence that our broadband initiatives are expanding our relationship with customers. ", "Revenues from the former MCI mass market business were $637 million and declined $204 million or 24.4% year on year. The important takeaway here is that growth is improving in the key areas of focus, namely data and broadband. ", "Let's look at some customer metrics.  In residential retail, let's start with our 23 million primary voice lines which are down 419,000 sequentially.  Primary voice lines are generally impacted more by competition from either wireless, cable telephony or some IP substitute service. As you know, our competitive response has been to push our broadband products, both DSL and FiOS data, bundle them with our voice services and in certain markets, combine that with a FiOS TV offer.  I would say we're doing fairly well.  During the third quarter, we added 120,000 more net broadband and video customers than the decline in primary lines. ", "In addition, we have many more customers on voice packages.  The number of Freedom customers has increased by about 2.5 million in the past year.  We now have about 7.5 million in total.  On a consumer RGU basis, which includes additional or secondary lines, we were up about 1% versus last year, and essentially flat sequentially.  We tend to view additional or secondary line loss as being driven more by secular change and technology substitutions than competition.  In fact, our own broadband initiatives are influencing customers to disconnect their additional lines. ", "Our bundling and broadband initiatives are starting to take hold.  We believe that this expanded customer relationship will improve revenue per household and increase customer loyalty, thereby improving retention. Total access lines were down 7.5% compared with a year ago, and were 977,000 lower on a sequential quarterly basis.  One-third of the total lines lost in the quarter were a combination of wholesale lines and former MCI mass market customers in regions. ", "We will spend the next few minutes on FiOS.  About a month ago, we conducted a FiOS briefing session in which we talked about our revenue opportunities, the network transformation, the customer experience and the business plan assumptions and economics.  Hopefully one of your takeaways from that session was our enthusiasm and the progress to-date and our confidence in the plan assumptions and outlook. Our quarterly results demonstrate the steady progress we are making and validation of our confidence. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we had 522,000 FiOS data customers at the end of the quarter.  Third quarter net adds were 147,000 compared with 111,000 in the second quarter.  We had 3.8 million homes open for sale.  Our subscriber penetration rate was 14%.  You can see from the ramp and our customer additions that we are gaining market share in a growing broadband market. ", "Our FiOS video customer total was 118,000 at the end of the quarter.  Here, quarterly net adds were 63,000 compared with 35,000 last quarter. With 1.2 million homes open for sale, we currently have a 10% subscriber penetration rate. As we indicated, customer acceptance in video is ahead of plan and the fact that we have many new and innovative features just around the corner bodes well for us, and we continue to differentiate our video service.  ", "Lastly, our churn in FiOS customers this quarter remains under 1.5% per month.  Our full-year targets of 725,000 FiOS data customers and 175,000 FiOS video customers remains the same. ", "A quick update with where we are with the capital cost to pass and connect premises.  Starting with the cost of pass, again, we are pleased with our progress to-date. We have moved average costs down from 1,400 per home to 845 as of the end of September.  That is a 40% decline in less then two years.  ", "On the capital cost to connect, we have moved costs down steadily as we have gained experience and expect this will continue. Capital cost per premise connected was $900 in September, down 25% this year, and we feel good about our $880 target by the end of the year. Beyond next quarter, we believe that GPON and other technologies will help us to further reduce capital spending per home and expect to see greater improvements as we move through the year. ", "From a deployment standpoint, we had passed 5.3 million premises through the end of September, and we should have no problem meeting our goal of 6 million cumulative by the end of December. ", "In Verizon business, we are focused on sequential revenue improvement. Revenues were up once again on a sequential basis, increasing by 1.7%.  In the enterprise business, the sequential growth of 3% this quarter is an improvement over the 1% sequential growth last quarter.  Continued traction in our strategic services revenues is driving the sequential growth. I talked about this earlier in the context of wireline data revenues.  We are seeing growth in Internet, private IP, Ethernet and ring services. We are also seeing some improvement in core services trends. Data services like ATM, frame and private line were up slightly.  Voice services were essentially flat. ", "In addition, we saw strong government project revenues and some improvements in CPE sales.  We are optimistic that we will continue to see steady improvement in both enterprise and total revenues and expect to see year-over-year growth in total business revenues within the next two quarters. ", "Broadly speaking, considering all aspects of combining the two companies, we would say that the integration efforts, after only nine months, have been a great success. We are definitely seeing operational benefits: salesforce and product integration, marketing efforts and customer relationship work have all gone very well. ", "As far as synergies go, we realized about $150 million in incremental synergies during the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around $350 million. Most of these savings are driven by headcount reductions, sourcing savings, network optimizations and traffic migration. We also have a number of systems integration projects underway that will result in additional cost savings in 2007 and beyond. We are currently on track to meet our synergy target for the year of $550 million.  So, good progress at Verizon business. ", "Let's turn now to wireless.  Verizon wireless continues to deliver outstanding, industry-leading financial results and performance metrics. Total quarterly revenues, which are now just shy of $10 billion, grew 18.2% year-over-year.  Sequentially, revenues were up $607 million or 6.6%.  Verizon wireless has the highest total revenues in the industry, as well as the highest growth rate.  ", "Notably, this growth was once again accompanied by the industry's best margins. EBITDA grew to $3.8 billion, a sequential improvement of 6.8%.  The quarterly EBITDA margin was 45%, up from 41.5% a year ago and 44.4% in the second quarter. Our margin performance is driven by the quality of our customer base and our efficient cost structure. Strong growth in service revenues was again driven by increased data usage and significant customer growth. Total service ARPU of $50.59 increased almost 2% sequentially and nearly 1% year over year.  Not surprisingly, this is entirely retail-related.", "Data revenues accounted for more than 14% of service revenue and represented $1.2 billion of revenue in the quarter.  Data made up $7.16 of total service ARPU, up substantially year-over-year and $0.76 sequentially. ", "We had an outstanding quarter of customer growth.  Our retail customer growth is, far and away, the best in the industry.  We added 2 million net new retail customers during the quarter, extending our industry lead in having the most retail customers. These are customers that choose Verizon-branded service from our direct and indirect channels. Total net adds were 1.9 million, as reseller churn resulted in a net negative of about 70,000 customers. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter in which we added more than 1.5 million net retail customers.  ", "Our 54.6 million retail customers represent more than 96% of our total customer base of 56.7 million.  Retail postpaid customers represent nearly 93% of our base. This quarter, 88% of all retail gross adds were postpaid.  This was higher sequentially, although lower than last year. Retail continues to be our focus.  That is because we serve and manage these customers directly. These are high quality customers in terms of loyalty and lifetime revenue.  They also tend to have the highest margins. ", "We continue to outperform the industry when it comes to customer loyalty. Total customer churn was 1.24%, retail churn was 1.15%, and retail postpaid churn was 0.95%. All three of these churn rates are lower than the third quarter last year.  The slight sequential increases in each are in line with previous seasonal trends. ", "Retail gross adds in the quarter were almost 6% higher than a year ago and sequentially better by more than 10%.  This performance is particularly impressive, considering some of the predictions last year when we decided not to continue our RadioShack relationship.  Retail gross adds from direct channel grew even faster, up 9.1% year-over-year. Importantly, these direct channels produce 74% of our retail postpaid gross adds this quarter.  This is a key metric for us and one that we track very closely.  This is because we know that customers buying through our direct channels have higher ARPU and lower churn. ", "We also continued to expand and diversify our indirect distribution channel, which includes local and national outlets like Best Buy, Costco and Wal-Mart.  Taking advantage of new retail channels and models, both direct and with our indirect partners, has helped us maintain a high quality base and been an important factor in developing our industry-leading efficiency and profitability. ", "As I have said many times, the key to our success in wireless data is our commitment to investing in our premier network.  Nearly 31 million, or about 57% of our retail customers, are data users, up significantly from just one year ago.  To date, 13.7 million or more than 25% of our retail customers, have EV-DO capable devices.  Moreover, data revenues from business applications such as broadband access and email have increased 135% in just one year. More than one-third of our data revenues come from business focused applications.  ", "We have three times more broadband access subscribers than one year ago and more than 55% of our data revenue growth comes from services other than messaging, primarily EV-DO based. We have an industry-leading portfolio of EV-DO capable devices, and we're taking advantage of exclusive periods on such devices as the Motorola Q, the LG Chocolate and the Samsung i830.  ", "In spite of these impressive data growth numbers, we are really just at the beginning of the wireless broadband revolution, and we have the network and products to take significant advantage of this growth trend. ", "I will summarize the quarter as follows.  We're gaining market share and expanding customer relationships. It is true in broadband and video with Verizon DSL and FiOS.  It is true in Verizon business, and it is certainly true in Verizon wireless.  Our organic growth initiatives are gaining momentum. We expect to continue this steady progress, and we are confident that this will differentiate us long term. ", "On the cost side, we continue to see significant opportunities.  We know how to control expenses, and we have an intense focus on reducing costs.  Along with strong operational execution, we continue to increase our financial flexibility and increase value to our shareowners. ", "As far as our current share buyback program, we repurchased an additional $350 million in shares during the third quarter for a total of $1.35 billion year-to-date. You will recall that we originally estimated $1 billion for the full year, and we did that in six months. At that time, we increased the buyback program by another $500 million for the second half of the year.  We expect to complete the $1.5 billion by year end. ", "As Ron noted earlier, the Idearc spin-off has been approved by our Board with distribution of shares scheduled to occur on or about November 17. As Idearc has reported in its SEC filings, Idearc plans to incur about $9 billion of debt in connection with the spin-off. As a result of the spin-off, Verizon will reduce its debt by about $7 billion through a debt-for-debt exchange mechanism and will receive about $2 billion in cash. ", "As previously announced, we plan to recommend to the board that it maintain the Verizon annual dividend at its current level immediately following the spin-off. Going forward, our intention is to continue to pay a competitive dividend.  ", "Finally, the sales of our Latin America assets are proceeding.  All these changes to our asset portfolio, along with continued strong cash generation, will unlock value for our owners. In summary, we are on track to meet our operational and financial performance targets for the year. ", "With that, I will turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Doreen.  Operator, Ivan and Doreen are now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from David Barden - Banc of America Securities.", " David Barden - Banc of America Securities", "Hi guys, good morning. Two questions, if I could, Doreen.  Maybe the first on, as you pointed out, the Latin America sales looking on track, the directories spin-off is moving ahead.  When you look at the cash that is going to be coming in the door from those and the debt capacity that will be opened up, could you talk a little bit more about what the game plan is as your buybacks starts to come to resolution here? ", "The second thing would be just on the margins, You were talking about operational expense goals on target.  One of those goals was expanding wireline margins sequentially over the course of the year. You have taken up the FiOS solution guidance a few pennies, but it does not seem like necessarily that would be the biggest driver for some of the margin compression we saw on wireline.  ", "if you could kind of elaborate a little on the net impact of MCI merger statement versus the FiOS guidance that you have said would be reflected in the fourth quarter number, that would be great. ", "Doreen Toben", "Okay.  Maybe if I start with the cash question.  I think first we should say we feel really good about what we have accomplished this year. The $1.5 billion share buyback looks to be a good target for us. We think that the spin-out of directory is creating incremental value for us.  And then, as you know noted I think in one of your write-ups, the spin-out actually increases the dividend for Verizon.  So it probably gives us, I don't know, 4%, to 4.5% dividend increase this year. We have about just under $3 billion coming back from international.  We also have $2.8 billion in spectrum that we need to pay for, mostly in the fourth quarter.  ", "So I think if we complete all these transactions, what I would expect is at least a $7 billion debt reduction coming in from the directory piece. We will use the cash on the $2.8 billion of spectrum that is a fourth quarter item, and then I think for the rest of it, what we are going to do is certainly meet with our Board, go through what we will do with the rest of the cash and it will be a first quarter discussion, I think, with you folks. ", "On the margin question, I would say it really is predominantly FiOS.  In the FiOS area, I would suggest it was mostly in cost of acquisition. Two things: the video ads were a little bit higher than we expected.  Cost of acquisition, marketing installation a little bit high.  Not bothered by that, because similar to the capital costs and homes passed and homes connected, we feel comfortable that we are going to be able to get the numbers where we need, so that was really driving it, as well as there was a one-time true-up on the content cost. We really hadn\u2019t been doing much on content cost because it was so early on, so the third quarter had a pretty decent accrual to start the content cost. ", " David Barden - Banc of America Securities", "What was that number, Doreen? ", "Doreen Toben", "I actually don't have it right in front of me.  Maybe Ron can get it to you later, but it was probably not insignificant from the FiOS perspective. As far as synergies with the VZB, they are on track.  We are comfortable with them, and they will certainly grow to the 550 in the fourth quarter.  It is predominantly a FiOS issue as far as the margin, coupled with the access lines are probably a little bit softer than we had originally anticipated in the plan.  It is probably the other piece of the margin story. ", " David Barden - Banc of America Securities", "Great, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Halpern - Sanford Bernstein. ", " Jeffrey Halpern - Sanford Bernstein", "Thanks. A couple of questions for you.  The first one on wireless and Verizon business. Can you talk a little bit about where you are in the ability for Verizon business to really cross-sell the wireless services, especially as you are moving into managed services and starting to beef up those offerings, the ability to help enterprise customers move applications to the mobile and to the network?  ", "Secondly, just to follow-up on David's question about FiOS and specifically focusing on multiple dwelling units in '07, because you mentioned in your FiOS briefing session a couple of weeks ago that you are clearly moving closer to that, and it is a significant portion of your base of access lines. Can you talk a little bit about how you anticipate the CapEx to connect customers looking in '07 given the MDU discussion? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "On the first question, a couple of things going on right now on the cross-selling with the technologies. We have very sophisticated approaches to putting bids together and working with customers.  So we have our salesforces out making joint proposals to customers.  We have our operations teams working through operational capabilities for our customers. We have just had a couple of industry conferences in which we have laid out some longer-term product maps so that we can show our customers exactly how we see some of the capabilities. ", "For example, when you look at IP protocols both for wireless and land line, you're looking at four-digit dialing both in wireless and land line.  So we are looking at a whole series of capabilities that will unfold out over the next two to three years and give customers a sense of where we're heading with this. ", "I think there is a lot of discussion about this wireless/wireline issue.  I think the important point for us is to focus on solution selling and help customers understand how the technology unfolds.  So we're at the beginning.  We have a couple of trials going on here or there on various capabilities.  ", "On the consumer side, Jeff, you didn\u2019t ask,  but on that we're about to open up a couple of stores that will sell both wireless and broadband, so we're looking at some things that we're doing in that area. So this is an exciting opportunity for us, but it is going to be driven mostly by product evolution, and that is how we see taking advantage of the opportunity.  ", "Doreen Toben", "On the multiple dwelling unit question, first I would say that I think we're making progress as far as getting the builder/owner\u2019s consent, which was a big piece of the MDUs.  Certainly have made technical progress in being able to do it.  I would suggest that we would anticipate on a cost to connect that it should actually run cheaper, as you would expect, depending on what technology.  So that actually should be a help to us. ", " Jeffrey Halpern - Sanford Bernstein", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik - UBS. ", " John Hodulik - UBS ", "Good morning. Two quick ones, maybe first for you, Doreen.  With the FiOS guidance, does the increase in expected dilution this year make you more confident in your ability to lower that number in '07?  If that is not the case, is it purely a success-based issue where if you add more subscribers, that number could go up, or just your thoughts on that given the new guidance would be great. ", "And then maybe one for Ivan.  The wireless results are obviously very strong, and I think we were surprised on the net add side considering a lot of other carriers are having trouble adding subscribers.  Do you see an end to this, given the penetration rates we're seeing in the US, or do you think you can maintain this level for another year or two?  I would just love to hear how you think about the industry, given the strong margins and net adds. ", "Doreen Toben", "John, I will start with the FiOS question.  I would suggest that we have said FiOS dilution should be about flat for '07.  I will continue with that kind of guidance.  It is, as you would imagine, however, success-based.  To the extent we are much more successful than we think in video or data, that number would move.  But for right now, I would still suggest it is about flat. ", " John Hodulik - UBS ", "Great.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "On the wireless question, look, we are very excited about our wireless results, obviously. They have been strong for almost four years now, five years.  So here is the way we think about it.  We think that the growth in wireless and the sustainability of our performance is really a function of how the team thinks about investing in their business.  So I believe that they have made very smart, very prudent and very thoughtful investments in their capabilities. So whether it is investments in the network;  we have been on the network promotion game since 1999, 2001.  So now we are up to EV-DO, EV-DO RevA.  We have invested in the channels.  We have invested in great handsets and products.  We have great culture.  We have good distribution across the company. ", "So my view of all of this is that as long as you see us making forward-looking investments in our capabilities that the growth should be sustainable. In fact, our view is that if you look at the results for the last couple of quarters, most of the analysts ask us if we can sustain it. Actually if you look at the results, we have actually widened the lead across the board. ", "I think as the industry goes through consolidations, companies are going through various changes in their own business.  I think we are in a position where we have been through most of those changes.  We can take advantage of this. If you want a good analogy, it is a little bit like trying to catch the Kenyans  in marathon running.  I think you can keep improving your numbers, but I have a feeling that the Kenyans keep getting faster. ", " John Hodulik - UBS ", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley. ", " Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you, good morning. Ivan, given that we've now almost completed the directory spin, is it time to again open discussions with Vodafone to see if there's any change in their position? ", "Also, on the small medium-size business, some of your competitors have seen very strong growth in that unit, and that is something that hasn\u2019t yet turned around for you.  Are there specific dynamics that might make that better in '07? Thanks.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Simon, I'm happy to answer the first question.  I wouldn\u2019t link the two.  I think that if I can, since you asked it that way, I might take a second and just comment.  When we think of the directory spin, our board has been very focused on why we are investing for growth in FiOS and in wireless and in completing the Verizon business transaction with MCI, that we were very concerned about making sure we return some value to shareholders.  At the same time, we were improving our balance sheet. So we think the spin stands on its own.  We feel good about it.  ", "As to the Vodafone issue, I think it stands where it always has.  This is driven by Vodafone's view of their business.  We have a contract with them that would suggest they pull the trigger on whether they want to exit the put or not, and that as you might all view, that over the last several months, every time it looks like Verizon is instigating any change it has a negative effect on both stocks.  ", "So I think the agreement I have with Arum is that if and when he is ever ready to consider it, that is the way we will move forward.  At this point we're not assuming that Vodafone has changed its mind on this put. ", "Doreen Toben", "I think on the small and medium business, I would start with some of it is definitional.  I do think that we probably have a little bit more medium in our business definition perhaps than the others, so I'm not sure it's exactly apples-to-apples.  Some of it is migration on the medium guys up to different data services. We are putting more feet on the street, more agency agreements, and also I think we are pretty encouraged because MCI brought a lot of products to the table that we did not have before.  So if I look at our current ramp, it is much better than it was.  ", "So I think going forward, I am encouraged with the additional sales capability and the additional products that they now have. ", " Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC. ", " Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC", "Thanks. Great quarter, guys.  Two questions.  Just to follow-up on the capital structure.  Ivan, what do you think is the right kind of debt to EBITDA multiple longer term after you are done with a lot of these transactions and when FiOS dilution peaks? ", "Secondly, I guess more subtly, do you think the cable companies are targeting you where you're doing your FiOS upgrades or where you are about to, try to lock in customers before hand or during the process? Thanks.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Okay. I will start, and if Doreen has anything she wants to add, she can. Look; on the debt to EBITDA numbers, just to make this pretty clear, if you take a look at the structure of our board, we have 12 of 14 directors who are financial experts, of which eight of them have been either the CFO or CEOs of both of their companies.  For the past three or four years, they have been extremely pointed in directing us to do a couple of things, which is invest for growth -- which you see -- and at the same time, improve our balance sheet. ", "So our targets on debt to EBITDA were about 1.4, 1.5.  Doreen and I have talked about this, and we think that in this kind of an environment and in this kind of an industry, it should probably be a little bit lower.  So whether it is 1.2 or 1.1 or 1.3, that is something Doreen is more qualified to answer.  But it definitely, long term, should be lower than the 1.5. ", "I think, Tim, we have moved in that direction. So we think a really strong balance sheet, coupled with strong investments in growth, is what our board has asked us to focus on.  So I think we are moving through that.  I think these shareholder-friendly transactions that we have been able to move on this year in terms of the Idearc spin, the sale of non-strategic long-term assets and moving through that is a good structure for us.  ", "So, as we move out into the future, I think having a strong balance sheet is something that we want to make sure we have, as well as investment-grade ratings for our Company. ", "Hopefully that answers that in a way that gives you a sense that this is really a board-driven activity that frankly, Doreen and I agree with completely, and our job is to execute on that view. ", "Doreen Toben", "I guess the only thing I would add is it is probably no longer a one metric issue.  So I don't think it's just debt to EBITDA, Tim, I think you have to look at free cash flow to debt as well.  So I think there are a couple of other metrics that we will be working with and taking to our board in the beginning of the year to see where we land. But it definitely with directory going out, it is lower than 1.5 and higher than 1, so someplace in between. ", " Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC", "Thanks.  And on the cable targeting of the FiOS upgrades, the reason I asked \u2013", "Ivan Seidenberg", "That is a good question.  Here is what I would say to that.  As we go over operating results, here is what we would say. We would say that a lot of the cable companies have had mature evolution of their technologies in some of our markets. Obviously Cablevision has, as has Comcast; so I don't think it is a question of targeting us.  It is a matter of where they have started.  Cox has also been pretty far along the train up there in the New England area. So I think the way I would look at this is not that we have been targeted.  It is that it has followed along their own technology evolution, and I happen to believe that the models that you have seen in certain markets will roll out across the country in the way they have done that.", "The other side of the coin is, you can see in some of the markets where they have rolled out early, we have started to see a little bit of a plateauing of some of the services they are selling.  So our view of this whole access line issue is that we will continue to see some pressure on access lines.  Some will come from wireless substitutions.  Some will come from the cable companies, the over-the-top VoIP.  But we think, as we look out into the future, our strategies for our own wireless and our own FiOS will begin to arrest that.  Perhaps Doreen could help you operationalize that in your models in a second here. ", "Doreen Toben", "As far as access lines? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Yes, sure. ", "Doreen Toben", "What I would say is, as we go into '07 and we look at the back half of '07 third/fourth quarter, we would expect that you are going to see certainly an improvement in where we are today and a flattening of the access lines is what we are predicting.  So it would be better. ", " Tim Horan \u2013 CIBC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns. ", " Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns ", "Thanks, guys. Doreen, I am just trying to maybe dig into the margin question a little bit deeper.  If you look at the pressure sequentially, we're looking at about 80 basis points of pressure sequentially.  70 basis points appears to be FiOS related, and then you've got an offset from MCI synergies ramping up, in my math, around 100 to 120 basis points.  So it looks like there is something significant in the range of 100 to 130 basis points of pressure.  Is that just increasing competition and pressures on the traditional business? ", "Secondly, on the enterprise revenue trends, obviously we\u2019re hearing good things across the industry.  Maybe just a comment on the competitive environment, and Verizon's appetite, there has been a lot of consolidation.  Are there any assets out there on the enterprise side that might be of interest? Thanks.", "Doreen Toben", "I think on the margin issue, Mike, you were right, it is really coming, I mentioned in the text here, that it was access lines.  I think it really is coming on the regular telco wireline side of the business in that the loss of access lines was causing the additional piece of the margin erosion for the most part.  ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "On the enterprise, Mike, I think on that point, a couple of things.  Generally what we are seeing is some consistent pressure on some of the repricing of contracts like you would have normally seen.  But we are seeing, for example, as Doreen pointed out earlier, strategic services are up over 20%, and we are seeing some stabilization in the way customers are looking at overall contracts.  So we are feeling better about our ability to continue to ramp.  As you can see in the results sequentially, we're up 3% in Verizon Business and 1.7% year-over-year. ", "As to your other question in terms of assets, no, I think we are pretty much focused on organic movement. We have a lot of work on the IT side and in the systems side to improve our capabilities.  We're also working on product maps to generate a lot of new products and services.  So we don't see a big strategic need for any movement at this point, so it is not something we are out in the market hunting for.  ", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers. ", " Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks for taking the question. Could you comment on the demand environment in wireline business?  The economic data seems to say one thing one week and another thing the next. I was wondering from your perspective, given the long sales cycle, are you seeing any slowing down in the number of RFPs that you're getting to look at or any requests for delays in circuit delivery, given the economic backdrop in the demand for business telcos services?  ", "Secondly, with respect to small and medium business, are you starting to see in your territories any evidence of cable starting to target the small business market?  They have certainly talked about doing it, and I was wondering any, prelaunch marketing activity, advertising campaigns, et cetera? Thanks.", "Doreen Toben", "If I start on the demand side for Verizon business, we are incredibly pleased.  You know, I would say they are not seeing any slowdown due to the economic conditions.  More RFPs, I think, than they have ever seen.  They are writing more business than they have ever seen. If you would talk to any of the salesforce, incredibly encouraged with what they are seeing.  So absolutely none as far is that is concerned. ", "On the small business side, I think what we would say is cable, especially in our territory, Cablevision for a long time has been targeting the small business.  You have probably seem maybe Comcast starting to ramp, but Cablevision has been after the business segment for a very long time. So I think we are used to it.  I would say outside the Cablevision territory, I don't think it is something that we are seeing a lot of at the moment. ", " Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers", "Great, thank you very much.", "Ron Lataille", "Operator, I would like to turn the call over now to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding remarks. ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Thank you.  Just a couple of comments to close the call.  As always, thank you for listening in and participating on our call. The headlines for us are pretty clear.  We feel that this was an important quarter for us, not only in delivering the results that Doreen talked about, but beginning to see some expansion of our top line, particularly generating a lot of organic growth across the board.  Our view of all of that is with the right investments in new platforms and services, the market is going to respond to the kind of innovation that we think all this technology brings.", "We think that if you look very quickly, VZW, a great quarter, making the right investments and our view is they have the capability to not only sustain, but continue to widen their read on the industry.  In the telco, as you can see, we had overall a positive quarter, even though we do have some work to do to continue to drive profitability, but we are very comfortable and actually pleased with the expansion of the top line with our broadband volumes and the success of FiOS.  ", "One thing we didn\u2019t get a chance to talk about is that every customer survey we do for people who already have FiOS, the churn is low and the customer satisfaction numbers are off the charts, so we know the product is a winning product and it is a question of making sure that we continue to drive the profitability, as you have been asking the question.", "Verizon business, lots of activity, top line expansion, lots of interest in customers moving to IP and MPLS. We still have obviously voice pressures on the business, but for the most part, customers are really being driven to all of the new technology.", "Lastly, hopefully you see in 2006 that we spent a great deal of time trying to unlock value in other ways in terms of asset sales, the Idearc spin, improving the balance sheet, share buyback that Doreen talked about, effective dividend increase that comes. So we feel good that as we head toward the end of the year, we have approached driving value for shareholders in a more balanced way, and hopefully you can see that it is being reflected in the performance of the stock so far this year. ", "So thank you all, and we will continue to do what we do and we will see you in the first quarter.", "Ron Lataille", "Operator, that concludes our third quarter earnings call.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the presentation. ", "(Operator Instructions) ", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2006 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and CEO; Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. ", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which area available on our website. ", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. ", "Earlier this month, we filed an 8-K with the SEC, reclassifying previously reported historical information related to our directory business into income from discontinued operations. As you know, this was due to the Idearc spin-off transaction. As a reminder, income from discontinued operations for the fourth quarter will include about six weeks of Idearc results, two months of Dominicana, and a full quarter of Puerto Rico. ", "In the first quarter 2007, and until the sale closes, income from Puerto Rico will continue to be included in this line item. ", "Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I\u2019d like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.35. Adjusted earnings, or EPS before the effects of special items, were $0.62. This quarter, there are five special items which we are excluding from adjusted results. ", "The largest item is a $541 million after-tax charge, which is $0.19 per share, related to our sale of Verizon Dominicana. The sale of our Dominicana property resulted in a pre-tax book gain of about $3 million. Offsetting this gain were $571 million of taxes recognized upon the sale per APB 23. As we previously disclosed, our net cash after-tax proceeds from this transaction were about $1.7 billion. ", "The next non-recurring item is a $101 million, or $0.03 per share charge for costs related to the spin-off of Idearc, mainly fees related to banking, legal, auditing and other administrative costs. As you will recall, the spin-off also generated $9 billion in cash and reduced debt. ", "The last three items we are excluding from adjusted results are: $55 million in after-tax charges, or $0.02 per share, related to severance and related pension and benefit costs; $47 million after tax, or $0.02 per share, for merger integration costs; and $30 million after tax, or $0.01 per share, for relocation and other costs related to our move to Verizon Center. ", "You should also note that we do not exclude the effects of amortization of intangibles from our adjusted results. For the full year, amortization expense related to MCI customer lists was $190 million pre-tax, or about $0.04 per share. ", "In summary, adjusted earnings were $0.62 for the fourth quarter and $2.54 for the full year. EPS from continuing operations -- that is, excluding income from Idearc, Dominicana and Puerto Rico, were $0.52 for the fourth quarter and $2.06 for the full year. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "Thanks, Ron, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our fourth quarter results, I would like to review some of the highlights of 2006, including the progress we made in a number of strategic areas. ", "As you know, we strongly believe that our strategic networks are the foundation of our business model. The Verizon wireless network has long been the undisputed quality leader, and it continues to deliver industry-leading operating and financial results. ", "In 2006, Verizon Wireless added more customers than any year in our history -- 7.7 million net adds. We continue to focus on the high quality retail market. We now have a customer base of more than 59 million, 96% of which are retail. And in the face of intense competition, we expanded ARPU and increased customer loyalty. ", "We made significant progress in our broadband transformation. We passed more than 3 million additional homes with our high-capacity fiber network, doubling the amount of premises pass. We also doubled the number of homes open for sale. ", "While making these significant strides in deployment, we also reduced the unit cost to both pass and connect homes. We also successfully created a new video business from scratch, including new network facilities, the acquisition of content, and obtained over 600 franchises, covering 7.3 million households. We ended the year exceeding our subscriber expectations with more than 200,000 video customers, and we expect video to gain even more momentum in 2007. ", "In the enterprise business market, the MCI merger gives us an unsurpassed local to global network and the ability to offer advanced services to the business customers around the world. We successfully integrated and stabilized the MCI business. ", "We introduced more financial discipline into the customer acquisition process, and we have successfully restored revenue growth, posting both year over year and sequential growth in the fourth quarter. ", "Our focus on investment and innovation is also positioning us to deliver additional value to shareowners as well as customers. During the course of the year, we strengthened our balance sheet and returned value to shareowners through the spin-off of Verizon Information Services, now Idearc, and the sale of our investment in the Dominican Republic. ", "We repurchased $1.7 billion of stock in 2006, and as we have previously said, we plan to recommend to our board that it maintain the annual dividend at $1.62 per share post Idearc spin. Since Idearc intends to pay a dividend, Verizon shareowners that hold Idearc shares have the opportunity to, in effect, get a dividend increase. ", "So as I look at 2006, we have become a more innovative, competitive, global and high-tech company. We\u2019re even more focused on our network-based, organic growth strategies and more unified in how we approach our customers. We also remain focused on profitable growth and creating shareowner value. ", "Okay, let\u2019s turn to slide 4 and look at some of the details. ", "Pro forma consolidated revenue growth was 3.9% in the fourth quarter and 3.3% for the full year. Revenues have grown sequentially each quarter this year, and about 60% of our annual growth of $2.8 billion occurred in the second-half of the year, which demonstrates the positive momentum we are building. As you\u2019ll see, revenue increases this quarter were once again driven by wireless, broadband, and enterprise data services. ", "Operating income increased for both the fourth quarter and for the full year. In fact, in 2006, revenue growth was more than $1 billion greater than the increase in cash expenses, leading to 10% growth in operating income and 100 basis point expansion in the operating income margin. So strong momentum as we enter 2007. ", "We ended the year with very solid cash flow results and a much stronger balance sheet. For the full year, cash from continuing operations totaled $23 billion, a 12.6% or $2.6 billion increase over 2005. Total capital spending came in at $17.1 billion, which is within the guidance range we provided in early 2006. ", "Our cap-ex to revenue ratio for 2006 was 19.4%. The year-over-year cap-ex increase is primarily attributable to adding MCI, which represented about $1.6 billion of the increase. The rest is from continued investments in wireless and broadband growth initiatives. ", "Debt was $36.4 billion at the end of the year, and while this is down almost $2 billion from last year, keep in mind that the debt assumed in the MCI acquisition was not part of the 2005 year-end number. At the end of January after the MCI transaction, we had $41.9 billion of net debt. So in effect, we reduced net debt by almost $9 billion since the MCI transaction. ", "Let\u2019s now turn to wireless, starting with some operational highlights. 2006 marked another year in which we sustained our growth by differentiating ourselves. We effectively and seamlessly increased network capacity to handle significant customer growth and, at the same time, maintain the reliability of our network. We expanded our wireless broadband capabilities, extending high-speed EVDO coverage by about 50 million pops, and also began our EVDO Rev-A deployment, which we will continue throughout 2007. ", "We introduced new and innovative products and services, including: ", "In the next few months, we will roll our V-Cast Mobile TV. ", "Another big differentiator for Verizon Wireless is the quality of our customer base. We are the industry leader in terms of total number of retail customers. These are the customers who choose Verizon\u2019s branded service. Through our direct relationships with these customers, the most reliable network, product innovation and excellent customer service, we not only maintained our customer loyalty but actually improved upon our leadership position. ", "2006 marked another year in which Verizon Wireless gained market share and delivered industry-leading financial results, extending our overall leadership in the industry. Our financial results for the fourth quarter, as shown on slide 7, continued to reflect the strength of our business model. ", "Quarterly revenues surpassed the $10 billion mark in the fourth quarter, and were up strongly, both sequentially and year over year. For the year, wireless revenues grew to just over $38 billion, an impressive 17.8% growth. ", "The quality of our customer base, as I mentioned earlier, along with our efficient cost structure, drove margin performance once again. ", "EBITDA for the quarter grew 8% year over year, and nearly 20% for the full year. Full-year EBITDA, which totaled $14.5 billion, had a higher growth rate than revenue. EBITDA margins were 43.2% in the fourth quarter, and 44.3% for the year, representing 110 basis point margin expansion over full-year 2005. ", "Once again, our strong growth in service revenues was driven by increased data usage and significant customer growth. Fourth quarter service ARPU of $50.12 increased 1.5% year over year, by far our highest quarterly growth rate this year. As you would expect, this is primarily related to our retail customer base. ", "Data revenues accounted for nearly 16% of service revenue and represented $1.4 billion of revenue in the quarter. Data made up $7.91 of total service ARPU, up substantially year over year, and $0.75 sequentially. ", "We had an outstanding quarter of quality customer growth, with 2.3 million net adds. More than 2.2 million of these net adds were retail customers, and even more significantly, 2.1 million of these were post-paid customers. In fact, we have seen strong sequential growth in retail net adds for each of the last three quarters, driven almost entirely by new post-paid customers. For the year, our retail base increased by 7.8 million net new customers, a 15.9% increase over 2005. We now have 56.8 million retail customers. ", "Customer loyalty remains very strong. Quarterly churn rates improved both sequentially and year over year. In the fourth quarter, total churn was 1.14%, and retail post-paid churn was 0.89%. ", "Wireless data services are continuing to grow, as you see on slide 10. 34 million, or 60% of our retail customers, are now data users, up from 49% one year ago. Data revenues in 2006 doubled compared with last year, and now total $4.5 billion. Data is not only an increasing component of total revenues, it also drove about half of the total service revenue growth in 2006. ", "Approximately 35% of data revenue comes from business-focused applications. Revenues from our Internet access and e-mail products increased 120% year over year, and more than 50% of our data revenue growth comes from services other than messaging, primarily EVDO-based. ", "Looking at our priorities in wireless for 2007, we will continue to focus on our network superiority and expand our wireless broadband capabilities. EVDO Rev-A will continue to be rolled out this year and we expect to have significant coverage in all major markets in 2007. We will continue to innovate. ", "As we announced earlier this month, we will roll out V-Cast Mobile TV service by the end of the first quarter, in partnership with QualComm. We will also continue our focus on adding retail customers. ", "Finally, we are confident that we will continue to gain market share, post industry-leading financial performance, and sustain our growth leadership position in the industry. ", "Let\u2019s now turn to our wireline segment. As you know, our goal is to transform the telecom franchise into a broadband business, and we made significant progress in expanding our broadband capabilities in 2006. As I mentioned earlier, we doubled the amount of homes passed with fiber. We\u2019ve also doubled the number of data homes open for sale, and on the video side, we increased the number of homes open for sale from about 110,000 at the beginning of the year to about 2.4 million by the end of December. ", "In Verizon Business, we expanded our global IT capabilities, which gave us a particularly strong position in the high-end of the enterprise market and enabled growth in strategic services, such as IP, ethernet, and managed services. ", "As we expanded our broadband and business capabilities, we also focused on reducing costs and improving our competitive cost structure. For example, in 2006, the wireline segment reduced headcount by about 9200 people. ", "Wireline financial results, as shown on slide 13, came in as I expected. Revenues have continued to show steady improvement as year-over-year rate of decline has decreased each quarter. Fourth quarter revenues declined 3.5%, a significant improvement from the 6.8% year-over-year decline in the first quarter. ", "This improvement is primarily due to data revenue growth. Data revenues grew 9.5% in the fourth quarter. Data now represents nearly one-third of our total wireline revenue stream. ", "Fourth quarter operating income margins of 8.9% were flat compared with last year and show a modest 10 basis points sequential increase, driven by strong cost controls in the quarter. These results include FiOS earnings dilution of $0.10 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.32 for the full year. ", "Let\u2019s take a more detailed look at some of the revenue categories. We are seeing some encouraging signs as the rate of decline in consumer retail revenues have decreased steadily since the first quarter, as our broadband products have become a more significant portion of this revenue category, about 14% this quarter. ", "Also encouraging is the fact that consumer ARPU of more than $53 grew 1% sequentially and nearly 4% year over year, providing evidence that our broadband initiatives are expanding our relationships with customers. ", "Within the regional small business market, revenues for the quarter were down about $16 million, or 1.2%. On a full-year basis, this revenue category totaled $5.2 billion and showed modest growth of about 0.2%. ", "As in the consumer market, data is becoming a more significant portion of this revenue stream. Small and medium business data revenues grew more than 30% in 2006 and are approaching 10% of this revenue category. ", "Finally, wholesale revenues, which includes special access, switched access and local wholesale, declined 3.1% in the quarter. This is due to the expected decline of UNE-Ps and also some intra-state switched access rate reductions. Again, the data portion of this revenue category, primarily special access, is continuing to grow, up nearly 6% in the fourth quarter. ", "Now let\u2019s look at some of the subscriber metrics, starting on slide 15. The three line items within consumer retail represent our strategic focus. As you can see, in the fourth quarter, we added 142,000 more net broadband and video customers than the decline in primary lines. This is an improvement over the third quarter when we added 120,000 more primary consumer units. ", "On a consumer RGU basis, which includes additional lines, we were up slightly on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. More importantly, the consumer revenue improvement was much greater. ", "Our FiOS subscriber metric continued to show steady growth in the fourth quarter. We also saw continued growth in FiOS Internet in the fourth quarter. We added 165,000 net new FiOS Internet subscribers, averaging more than 12,000 per week. For the full year, we added 517,000 net subscribers. We now have 687,000 FiOS Internet subs, representing 14% penetration of homes open for sale. Combined with DSL, we have 7 million total broadband customers, up 1.8 million from a year ago. ", "We ended the year with 207,000 FiOS TV subscribers, with 89,000 net adds in the quarter. This is an average of 6800 net new subscribers per week. We ended the year with 2.4 million homes open for sale, with an increase of 1.2 million in the fourth quarter alone. ", "As you know, we made a significant number of homes open for sale in late December in New Jersey, after receiving a state-wide franchise during the quarter. Almost half of the 1.2 million homes open for sale in the fourth quarter came online in the last two weeks of December. So even with this late-in-the-year increase in homes open for sale, we achieved 9% penetration in our first full year of offering video. We are seeing that six out of every 10 FiOS TV orders are also requesting FiOS Internet to be installed at the same time. ", "In Verizon Business, which serves global enterprise and government customers, we continue to see improvements on the demand side. We\u2019re seeing volume growth and increasing demand for bandwidth, especially in the premier enterprise customer segment. This helped drive a 27% increase in strategic services revenue in the fourth quarter and helped restore total business year-over-year revenue growth. Revenues totaled $5.3 billion in the quarter, up 2.7% year over year, with higher sequential growth in each of the last three quarters. ", "We believe this is a meaningful turnaround in the business. For the year, Verizon Business generated more than $20.6 billion in revenue. Strategic services exceeded $4.1 billion in 2006, and now represents 20% of total Verizon Business revenue. ", "Our integration efforts have also been successful. From an operational perspective, the integration of MCI generated $600 million in synergy savings in 2006, which is slightly ahead of our targeted $550 million in year one. We are increasing our 2007 synergy target from $825 million to $900 million. ", "Many of the incremental savings we expect in 2007 are from systems integration projects that are well underway. ", "Another area we will focus on in 2007 will be reducing access costs. Verizon Business continues to have lots of opportunities to grow market share and increase efficiency. Our Wireline priorities in 2007 focus on three key areas: ", "As I previously guided, we expect FiOS earnings dilution to be at its peak in the fourth quarter of 2006 through the first quarter of 2007. Dilution should be about $0.11 in the first quarter of this year. ", "Let me summarize as follows: we had a strong 2006, both operationally and financially. We gained market share and expanded customer relationships. Our organic growth initiatives are gaining momentum and have created the foundation for sustainable, long-term growth. ", "As far as our financial outlook, as we\u2019ve said many times, we believe our networks are and will continue to be a strategic differentiator. We plan to invest between $17.5 billion and $17.9 billion in those networks in 2007. On the Wireline side, we expect total cap-ex of $10.7 billion to $10.9 billion. This includes some additional capital to reduce access costs going forward and additional success-based investments related to FiOS, and growth in private IT, web hosting, and new product development. ", "Integration capital is expected to be higher in 2007 versus 2006, but we are still within our original guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion over three years. ", "In Verizon Wireless, we expect spending to be between $6.6 billion and $6.8 billion, as we continue to add capacity and enhance our broadband capabilities. ", "We will also continue to increase our financial flexibility and create value for our shareowners in 2007. We recently announced a spin-off and merger of access lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont, with FairPoint Communications. We are nearing the completion of the Puerto Rico telephone company sale, and as I said, we plan to continue our share buy-back program at similar levels to what we did in 2006. ", "With that, I will turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Ivan, Denny, and Doreen are now available to take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "Your first question is from John Hodulik of UBS. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Thanks, good morning, everyone. Just a couple questions. First, I guess for Doreen, we appreciate the guidance you gave for \u201907. Is it possible for you guys to give us a little bit more direction from an earnings standpoint, or maybe even more as it relates to FiOS metrics? ", "Secondly, for Doreen, I thought the consumer ARPU strength was nice, and a little bit surprising, a little better than we thought. Could you give us some more trends going forward, where we go from the 4% as you guys expand the reach of FiOS? ", "Then, for Ivan, I thought the FairPoint spin was well-received and the price is good. Is that the kind of structure we can expect going forward, as you look at some of the other line sales? ", "Then, sorry to keep going like this, but while we have Denny on the line, can you give us an initial look on what your first priorities are, as you start to oversee the wireline business? ", "Doreen A. Toben", "I\u2019ll start. If I start with the ARPU one first, I think what you saw was almost 4% ARPU growth in the quarter. What I would tell you is December accelerated, so it was even higher than the quarterly average. We expect to see it increase significantly even next year. It\u2019s really a mix between price-ups that we\u2019ve been doing, both in December as we roll into \u201907, as well as the fact the product mix, you know, the data and the video, has really made a big difference. ", "I think I\u2019ve used before with you anecdotally, we\u2019re seeing at least one state now at sort of a 15% ARPU, so we\u2019re certainly encouraged in where we\u2019re seeing the ARPU. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "It seems that the consumer business should grow nicely next year as you continue to see that accelerate. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "I think what you\u2019ll see is the trends from this year will certainly improve next year. If I talk you through the guidance, if you start with the $2.06, which was the recurring number, I would say if you think about there is still about $0.05 in concave A that\u2019s in there, not in discontinued ops. You should think about there\u2019s $10 billion, a little bit more than $10 billion in cash that we would earn interest on from all the deals that we did. You should think pension and OPEB as relatively flat. Pension\u2019s really a help, but the discount rate, it did move the discount rate from 575 to 6, so you think pension and OPEB as relatively flat. Kept the ROA the same, so no change there at 8.5. ", "I think when you come down to it, I would say we had 10% operating income growth this year. I would say that we would have at least a 10% op income growth next year. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Great, thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "John, on the FiOS dilution, we\u2019re expecting about $0.11 in the first quarter of this year. Given the take rate experience that we had in the fourth quarter, we could see dilution for the year in the mid-$0.30 range. Of course, our view is that success-based dilution is good news in the long run. ", "I would like all to understand that we\u2019re making some very good progress in reducing [wait] time in the home. We really do understand the key drivers. For example, we\u2019re deploying timesaving technologies, MOCA, for example. We\u2019re using software tools to help quickly configure PCs and TVs. We\u2019re also increasing productivity by doing more actually before the tech gets into the home. ", "I guess bottom line on the FiOS dilution is we\u2019d like you to know that we are focused on eliminating unnecessary wasted time inside the home and in preparing the home from the outside. Our outlook for cost to pass and connect has not change and we\u2019re making some very good progress. ", "Ivan G. Seidenberg ", "On the FairPoint transaction, just a couple of comments. We do like the transaction. We like the structure. We like the buyer. I would say this, here\u2019s the way we\u2019d like you to think about all these access line transactions: this was a unique one. Whole states, a good buy, a solid operator, something that when you look at the long term, there\u2019s no dispute that these three states are more rural than they are anything else. We think that FairPoint offers a way for these assets to be repositioned and continue to participate in the growth of the industry as they would manage rural assets. ", "As far as your question about other structures, yes, we like the Morris Trust. We\u2019d also like to take a step back now and absorb everything that we\u2019ve done, so we\u2019d like to get this FairPoint thing a little further along, complete the other transactions that we have and keep an open eye, but we\u2019re not in any rush to make any other moves, unless there\u2019s something really unique that makes a lot of sense for shareholders. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "John, on your question on priorities, and let me back up a second here and just say that the organizational changes that were made in December were the result of Ivan, Larry [Babio] and I talking about these changes for several months. Our feeling was that the time was right. Verizon Wireless, of course, in great shape, the transformation of the teleco to broadband well underway, and our Verizon business integration successful in \u201906, and we feel very good about that in \u201907. ", "So to your question, the priority or the goals for this year are to increase our focus on growth, organic growth, of course, in particular, to increase our rate of growth; that is, increasing product innovation and speed to market and also, of course, to enhance customer service and to continue to improve our cost structure throughout 2007. This is not only the priorities that I have but this is shared by each of the individuals who run our groups; telecom, wireless, business, and also Verizon Services we think will give us a great advantage this year in realizing economies of scale and helping us improve our cost structure. ", "Another focus with our new organization is for introducing services and bundled announcements that leverage our assets across all of our groups. In fact, you will see tomorrow that we will make the first of many announcements in which we will bundle wireless into our consumer plan. So stay tuned for that tomorrow. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Great, thank you. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, John. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from David Barden of Banc of America. ", "David Barden - Banc of America", "Thanks, guys. I\u2019ll try to keep it to two. The first would be just on the business side, obviously some strong growth in the enterprise. If you could talk about the forces at work there, you know, the mix of point of sale pricing versus technology price downs versus contract re-pricings and how that trend looks into 2007, and you know, in this fourth quarter, if anything in there is CPE type of sales. ", "Then, the second question, maybe just Denny, kind of drawing on some of your experience. Obviously very strong growth this year in wireless, especially in the fourth quarter. Some competitors are grappling with some internal questions. They\u2019re going to try to get back on their feet by the second-half of the year, focusing on handsets. Cingular is going to be trying to bring their iPhone product to the market, again another marquee handset. One criticism for Verizon, not that you see it in the numbers, but it\u2019s been that the handset mix has been moderate relative to competitors. As this becomes a new focus, what is Verizon Wireless\u2019 game plan for staying strong in the second-half of \u201907 as the wireless competitors try to bring new stuff to market? Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "David, a wide range of questions, and let me start on the business side. In pricing, we\u2019ve experienced a moderate stabilization in 2006, particularly in our legacy products. We have sales of our next generation services, such as private IP, are doing very well, and we\u2019re seeing an increased response from our competitors in that regard. ", "But our focus continues to be on profitable revenue growth. CPE, our focus this year is more, as CPE being an add-on to what we sell. On the revenue growth outlook for business, the trends are good and we saw sequential revenue growth, as you heard from Doreen, throughout 2006. We\u2019re looking forward to overall business market trends that put us into a good position for growth in \u201907. ", "We expect continued year over year total Verizon business revenue growth, particularly focusing on IT and professional services that we\u2019re able to bring to the marketplace. ", "On the wireless question, let me start with the iPhone. That\u2019s probably the most popular question these days. If you all have seen the USA Today article that Leslie Cauley wrote, our take is that she was right on. The iPhone market, the iPhone product is something where, quite frankly, we\u2019re happy that we\u2019re not first to market with the iPhone. ", "We think that innovation and a focus on music will benefit the whole industry. It really does draw attention to our data capabilities. You heard from Doreen that that\u2019s a very strong market for us, but bottom line on the iPhone, I think we\u2019re -- many are interested in comparing a future offering with what we have in the marketplace today: it\u2019s like comparing apples and oranges. ", "I will tell you that we will stay competitive and more on that as the year rolls out. ", "Looking at the product line that we have, particularly the handset lineup, we\u2019re very confident with our strategic partners and we\u2019ve had a lot of good product from all three of our major suppliers, and there too, more on that as the year rolls out. ", "David Barden - Banc of America", "All right, thanks. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, David. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Tim Horan of CIBC. ", "Timothy Horan - CIBC World Markets", "Good morning, guys. One clarification and one question. Doreen, does the cap-ex guidance include set-top box cap-ex? ", "Doreen A. Toben", "Yes, Tim. ", "Timothy Horan - CIBC World Markets", "Great. Then, on the wireless side, Denny, you had a really strong quarter here. It seems like some of your competitors are kind of injured out there. Would your preference be to go out and continue to gain market share and maybe keep margins kind of flattish where they\u2019re at now? Or do you think you can continue to expand margins at the rate that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years going forward? Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Our margin outlook continues, Tim, to be the same. We expect margins in the 43% to 45% range, so no change from the previous guidance that you\u2019ve had from us. ", "In terms of perhaps slowing down growth, if that was your indication there, we have no intentions of slowing down growth. Our goal is to continue to take share as we have quarter after quarter. We\u2019ll do that by also focusing on profitability. We\u2019ve done both quarter after quarter, grown the base and been profitable in the 43% to 45% range. ", "Timothy Horan - CIBC World Markets", "Thank you. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Just an add-on to that, Tim. We\u2019re pleased with the local member portability results that we\u2019ve had. We take in two customers for every one that we hand over to our competitors, so good result there. ", "Timothy Horan - CIBC World Markets", "Have you seen any slowdown in that metric? ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "We have not. It\u2019s been essentially the same. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, Tim. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. ", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Good morning. A couple of FiOS questions. First, on FiOS TV, about 40% of the homes you\u2019ve built passed. That\u2019s starting to accelerate. How should we think about that for \u201907 as you go to 9 million homes passed? Are you going to be able to keep that 40%, grow it to 50% or 60%? ", "Secondly, in the past, you\u2019ve given us penetration numbers for markets that have been open six, nine months or whatever. Can you give us a feel for where we are in places like Keller where you\u2019ve really been able to have a good time in the marketplace with the product? Thanks. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "I\u2019ll start with the first part. Keller is, I\u2019m looking around to see if I should give the number. Texas is probably well over 20%, 22%, 25%, Texas all by itself. Keller is very, very high. ", "We stopped giving the six, nine and twelve because we\u2019re giving you in total and because we have so many different COs that start to roll into that, so we though by giving you the total penetration, it was probably more effective. ", "Off the top of my head, I actually don\u2019t know the first part of the question on \u201907. ", "Ivan G. Seidenberg ", "I can help, maybe, but maybe Simon, we don\u2019t understand the frame of the question. We\u2019re going to do another 3 million about. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve said. ", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "You\u2019ll do 3 million TV homes? ", "Ivan G. Seidenberg ", "No, homes passed we\u2019ll do. ", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "I guess it\u2019s open for market on TV. Should we be thinking that at the end of this year, you\u2019ll be at 5 million open for market on TV? ", "Doreen A. Toben", "That\u2019s a relatively -- about that number is a good number, Simon. ", "Ivan G. Seidenberg ", "We\u2019ll clarify that over the course of the first quarter, give you a little better information but you\u2019re not that far off. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Simon, if I may add, first of all, looking at last year, we feel very good about the FiOS data adds that we had. Video actually was over our goal, and as Doreen had mentioned in her comments, penetration increased in the fourth quarter to 14%. So we feel very good about our goals and growth opportunity in \u201907. Everybody loves the service: the speed, the service quality, the reliability. As you may know, in a recent consumer reports review, we blew away the competition. ", "Our view is that the market is ready for the upgrade that we can provide. ", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, Simon. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Mike McCormack of Bear Stearns. ", "Michael McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Thanks, guys. Just a quick comment, if you would, on wireline margins. We obviously can quantify the impact on the quarter from FiOS and MCI, but maybe just a comment on seasonality and what impact that might have had on the wireline margin, because it really held up pretty well. I\u2019m just trying to see if there\u2019s still an impact there. ", "Secondly, and maybe it\u2019s a combined question here, but on data, data was I think across the industry so far a little bit weak. So maybe some trends you\u2019re seeing in the DSL marketplace. FiOS adds were good but you missed your target there, so are we seeing just sort of an aging of the base you\u2019re selling into? ", "Then, connected to that, the access line losses. The rate of decline actually worsened, but the rate of worsening actually is the best we have seen in several quarters, so maybe just some comments on the cable competitiveness. Thanks. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "First of all, we didn\u2019t miss any targets on FiOS. We feel very good about the FiOS number. ", "But let me come back to margin outlook. We expect wireline margins to stabilize, certainly not to get worse. We could see some I\u2019ll call it lumpiness from quarter to quarter, but overall, we see improvement in late \u201907 and into 2008. ", "If I can break down just the two wireline pieces, in telecom, we see continued success in our FiOS rollout. Operating expense savings, we expect to see as FiOS gains some scale. Continued ARPU growth and, as I mentioned earlier, incidentally we\u2019re very focused on elimination of time in the home to improve our overall metrics on FiOS. ", "On the business side, we\u2019re achieving the merger synergies, improving our cost structure and frankly, we are gaining market share, so we feel quite good about how we\u2019re positioned for 2007. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "If I could go back just a second on wireline margins, there was perhaps some seasonality in the fourth Q, or maybe I would suggest as you think about \u201907 and you think about on the Verizon business side, each quarter with their synergies, their margin improved, as well as the fact that the FiOS dilution is the worst in the beginning of the year, you might see -- Denny called it lumpiness, but you may see the wireline margins stabilize but sort of ramp up as opposed to flat across the whole year. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Mike, on the access line outlook, our goal is less overall line loss in \u201907 than we saw in 2006. FiOS will of course increasingly help, particularly in the second-half of the year, as we gain some scale with FiOS, but I will tell you that we also have a significant focus on retention of access lines in \u201907. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "On the competitive piece, as you would expect, the competitors that have been in market for a long time are probably flat to down, and perhaps the ones that are newer in an area are up, but I would say actually overall, the VOIP adds appear to be relatively flat Q-to-Q. ", "Michael McCormack - Bear Stearns", "I know you guys are not really focused on the cost per home number specifically, but can you give us your sense for how close you are to what the year-end goals were? ", "Doreen A. Toben", "I think what I said was we certainly beat in both cases what we told you, so we were much better. Then, the other thing I would tell you is we\u2019re probably not going to give this to you every quarter. We gave you the five-year number. We\u2019re not that far off, if you look at homes for pass to what we told you the five-year number was, and connected. Considering we beat both of them, you know what the five-year target is, I probably am not going to give you the absolute number of Q-to-Q now. ", "Michael McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Okay, thanks, Doreen. Thanks, guys. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, Mike. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Chris Larsen of Credit Suisse. ", "Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "Thanks, good morning. First question, the incremental capital spend, it looks a little bit higher, particularly in wireline. Can you give us a sense where the mix shift is? Is that more a function of incremental set-top boxes, as you\u2019re going to add about three times the number of subs this year? ", "Secondly, on the FiOS solution, Denny, how do you think about balancing growth versus the dilution? If you go back to the wireless days, it was just grow as quick and get as much market share as possible. If we look at what is going on in video, this may be the opportunity to grab that share as people are making this transition to high definition and the flat panel TVs, and this could be your one opportunity to hurry up and get in there as people decide what new TV to get in the home. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "I\u2019m going to start on the capital side, Chris. If you think about the increase, it\u2019s probably in a couple different places. One, it\u2019s much more success-based, so you see it in the set-top box and the cost to connect. However, there\u2019s also a substantial piece of it on what I would call the business side of it. We\u2019ve done real well on web hosting. That seems to be expanding, so we\u2019re going to grow web hosting. We\u2019ll do some things perhaps in international, as well as we talked about the fact we didn\u2019t spend as much as I would have anticipated in integration capital this year on trying to get access charges down, doing some more co-locations, doing some more grooming, doing some more putting buildings on net. So we\u2019re going to see that number kick up as well, so it\u2019s sort of a mix of the two different areas. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "On the FiOS growth, your comment was right on. Yes, we see that we have a window of opportunity with a superior product to what our competitors have, so our goal is to be very aggressive in FiOS, particularly on the video side. ", "I will also tell you though that as in wireless, we\u2019ve learned some lessons there, of course, we\u2019re focused not only on growing FiOS but also on controlling our costs and margin improvement. So that\u2019s the story. What we\u2019ve done in wireless, our goal is to do the same with our FiOS new product offering. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Tom Seitz of Lehman Brothers. ", "Thomas Seitz - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks for taking the question. A couple of quick ones. Could you talk debt levels? I guess I\u2019m particularly interested in Verizon Wireless. By our estimates, there essentially won\u2019t be any net debt at the end of this year. I\u2019m wondering what sort of arrangement you have with Vodafone regarding the uses of free cash flow. Are you going to have to lever back up? ", "Secondly, small business was stronger than we were looking for. I was wondering, are you engaged in win-back campaigns now, as Cablevision\u2019s entrance matures in your markets? Or is that just more of a macro environment trend? Thanks. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "Starting at the debt level, I would suggest you\u2019re probably a year off on when the debt goes perhaps to zero. Not quite sure what is happening with spectrum, when the 700 auction comes up, if we participate in the 700 auction. But when it does get to a zero, it would be at our discretion to put forth what kind of a dividend policy we wanted to have. I think that\u2019s more an \u201908 discussion than an \u201907 discussion, Tom. ", "Thomas Seitz - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Tom, let me comment on the small business piece. First, I would say that the small business market clearly to us is important. It is a growing market. I would also say that competition is not at all new in the small business space. We\u2019re focused on retention. We\u2019re focused on win-backs and I will tell you that I think we are in a good position. Our key differentiator is our reliability and our quality. We have a dedicated sales force of some 4,000 people. ", "And I will also tell you that the MCI merger has helped us in this regard, because it gives us a strong agent channel that comes from the merger. We\u2019re very focused in small business. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "Just so I was clear, it\u2019s an \u201908 -- on the dividend, it\u2019s an \u201908 discussion for probably an \u201909 implementation. ", "Thomas Seitz - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, Tom. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Qaisar Hasan of Buckingham Research. ", "Qaisar Hasan - Buckingham Research", "Good morning. I had a couple of quick questions. One, just on consumer rate increases, we understand you recently raised prices on your freedom plans by $5. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, whether in fact just new customers, existing customers? It seems to be a slight change in your strategy versus a couple of years ago, where you were actually quite aggressive on your pricing, given competition. What\u2019s changed in your thinking that\u2019s actually allowing you to actually raise prices not just on voice, but also data and video? ", "Secondly, on MCI, based on the numbers that you guys have provided in the past, I think you did about $350 million in synergies in the first three quarters, which implies probably about $250 million in the fourth quarter. Given that run-rate, the $900 million in \u201907 looks a little bit on the light side. Could you just maybe walk through the math there and where we might be off? Thanks. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "Qaisar, I\u2019ll start on the pricing. We did up the price on freedom across the county about $5. We felt based on the take rates we were getting and the churn that we were able to do that. We\u2019ve not seen a decrease in the sales because of the increase. We also had an increase in the DSL pricing, especially at the low end. The numbers that we had at $14.95, we\u2019ve seen them move up to $17, $19 and $21 in some states. I think if you compare that to any other offer, any other cable model offer, we\u2019re still at the low end. We\u2019ve seen very successful take rates and thought that we could do it. The churn has come down significantly. We\u2019re not playing on the price side at all on the video market. We\u2019ve been really pleased with our video pricing and our video ARPU, so the churn and everything has really shown us that we\u2019ve got the ability to have some pricing flexibility here. ", "On the MCI synergies, I\u2019ll take another look at it next year. I probably am always conservative, so what we\u2019ll do is we\u2019ll start with that number and as I work through \u201907, we\u2019ll see if we update it as we get into the year. ", "Qaisar Hasan - Buckingham Research", "Great, and Doreen, could you just confirm that the freedom rate increase was across your existing base and not just on new customers? ", "Doreen A. Toben", "It is my understanding, but we might have to get back to you, that it was across the base. It was not just on new. ", "Qaisar Hasan - Buckingham Research", "Great, thank you. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks. Operator, next question, please. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is from Frank Louthan of Raymond James. ", "Frank Louthan - Raymond James", "Good morning, thanks. Quickly, on the data center outlook, give us an idea on what are you seeing in the demand for that or any pricing? As far as your cap-ex expansion on that, are you planning to build entirely new data centers or build out some more? ", "Then, as far as doing the work on trying to keep the install time down on FiOS, maybe a little more color on that. What is the average install time running relative to what the target is? Do you think at some point it might make sense possibly just to run some additional cap five or something like that to try and cut that time down? I know that\u2019s not been part of the strategy, but would that possibly be an additional part of the strategy going forward, given the time constraints you\u2019re running up against? Thanks. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "I\u2019ll start on the web hosting. You meant web hosting, right, Frank, when you said data centers? ", "Frank Louthan - Raymond James", "Yes, that\u2019s what I meant, yes. ", "Doreen A. Toben", "Okay. Yes, we\u2019ve had incredible demand for web hosting all year, and so you\u2019ll probably see us do some more build-outs to try to meet the demand. It\u2019s really been an expanding product segment for us. Obviously it\u2019s in the capital numbers increase that we gave you. ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "On the install time for FiOS, as I had mentioned a little bit earlier, we are deploying some time-saving technologies, MOCA being one of them. We\u2019ve got a new software tool to help configure the PCs and also the TVs in the home. We do not disclose the number of hours, but rest assured that we\u2019re doing everything we can to get that number down and to drive costs out of our installation and we\u2019re on the targets that we had established. ", "Frank Louthan - Raymond James", "Do you think those processes will be sufficient, or it would, you know, possibly doing some additional wiring as a means just to avoid some of the hold-ups with the wiring in the house? Would that be part of the strategy, something that you would consider down the road? ", "Dennis F. Strigl", "Frank, I will comment that we are looking at all opportunities to cut our costs. ", "Frank Louthan - Raymond James", "That\u2019s great. Thank you. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks, Frank. Operator, I would like to now turn the call over to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding remarks. ", "Ivan G. Seidenberg ", "Thank you for your questions. As you can see, we feel comfortable and we\u2019re very confident that 2006 turns out to be a very solid year for us. We accomplished some significant repositioning of lots of assets in the business. We were able to unlock some value and create some substantial financial flexibility going forward for the company. ", "As you can see, we\u2019re a simpler, more focused business. All of our groups have momentum leaving \u201906 and into \u201907, the wireless group and the business group and the teleco group. Also, our Verizon Services group, which is our infrastructure support services group across the business, gained some momentum and they will certainly help to ameliorate a lot of the growth activities we have by some strong, cost management across the company. ", "Business conditions across all three of our groups appear to be gaining some momentum in \u201907, so we feel comfortable that the market will provide a little bit of a wind at our back, in addition to all of the investments that we\u2019re making. ", "Frankly, our focus for 2007 is pretty simple: we\u2019re intent on achieving higher sustainable growth rates at the same time we\u2019re delivering bottom-line performance. The management changes we made are clearly geared to help us accelerate getting bottom-line performance with all of the capital we\u2019ve deployed over the last several years going forward. ", "Many of you would like to know what we\u2019re going to do with our cash. We feel we have a great balance sheet. We have done a lot of good things. Doreen mentioned that we\u2019ll continue the share buy-back program that we have now. We\u2019re always looking for ways, as the year unfolds, to further unlock value should the opportunity arise. ", "Having said that, we thank you for your participation and we\u2019re looking forward to a positive 2007. ", "Ron Lataille ", "Operator, that concludes our call today.

Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. ", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Ivan Seidenberg for some opening remarks. ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Thank you and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your dialing in this morning. In just a moment, we will go over our quarterly results. We're pleased with the performance there, and you will see that we have lots to talk with you about on our performance in the second quarter. ", "You also know that we just announced this morning an acquisition of Rural Cellular Corporation's assets. I thought at the beginning of the call, we would take just a moment to provide you with some information and some color about this. Rural is an attractive corporation. They operate in the 850 megahertz cellular footprint. We understood over the past several days that they wanted to complete their transaction and the sale of the company by this weekend. ", "This is an asset that we have had under some surveillance for awhile. We constantly look at these things. We thought there was a significant synergy opportunity for our company. It would provide a meaningful expansion of our footprint, as well as improve service for our existing Verizon Wireless customers. Of course, we believe that the valuations for both Rural\u2019s shareholders and Verizon\u2019s shareholders were in line, and therefore, we moved forward over the weekend. ", "Just a couple of quick details about the transaction. As you read in the press release, purchase price was $2.67 billion, $45 per share. Broken down the equity price is $757 million; the residual of that is debt, for a combined total of enterprise value of $2.67 billion. The $45 represents a 16% premium over the last ten trading days and a 41% premium over the closing price on Friday. We think there are opportunities for more than $1 billion in synergies through reduced roaming and operating expense savings. We think obviously this transaction will be attractive to our shareholders. It will be neutral to modestly accretive in 2008 and accretive in 2009 and thereafter. ", "One interesting point about this is the customer base for Rural is over 700,000. They operate in about 15 states. We think regulatory approvals will take some time during the second quarter, no later than the first half of '08. Lastly, this company operates both GSM and CDMA networks. Our plan would be -- just to make sure there's clarity about it -- would be to build an overlay CDMA network, convert their existing customers to CDMA, but we will continue to operate the GSM network to serve the roaming needs of the GSM carriers that utilize those facilities. ", "We're excited about the transaction. We think it was opportunistic. Rural is a good company. We think this is very attractive for Verizon shareholders both strategically and financially. So with that, Ron, let's go back to the routine call, and we will pick up on the quarterly results. Thank you. ", "Ron Lataille", "Thank you, Ivan. Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I would like to point out that both reported and adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.58 for the second quarter. The only special item that we're excluding from adjusted results is relatively small, a $17 million after-tax charge for merger integration costs. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen. ", "Doreen Toben", "Thanks, Ron and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results were strong and we sustained our momentum. Verizon Wireless had an excellent quarter with a continuation of their very strong growth in customers, revenues, margins and cash flow. We also saw higher wireline revenue growth in both consumer and global enterprise services. Top line growth continued to accelerate this quarter as consolidated revenues grew 6.5% compared with last year. ", "We also improved margins as operating income increased 14.9% year-over-year. Our $0.58 of adjusted EPS from continuing operations resulted in another quarter of double-digit growth, up 11.5% from a year ago. For the first half of the year, EPS from continuing operations grew 13.1%. ", "Let's take a closer look at consolidated revenues and margins. Our accelerating growth has resulted in a $2.6 billion increase in consolidated revenues year-to-date. 90% of our revenue base had positive year-over-year growth. In the second quarter, we continued to see organic growth across all business units. Verizon Wireless revenues were up 17.1%, legacy consumer revenues grew 3.4% and Verizon Business had 2.4% growth. Operating income grew to $8.1 billion in the first half, an increase of $1.2 billion versus last year. So, as you can see, very profitable revenue growth as we continued to drive the business to accelerate revenues and expand margins. ", "Cash flows from continuing operations in the quarter were strong. Our first-half total of $11.6 billion represents 7.5% growth over last year. Total debt was $32.5 billion at the end of the quarter, down $2.2 billion since last quarter and just under $10 billion lower than a year ago. ", "We have continued to repurchase shares. During the quarter we bought back more than 500 million of our common stock. In early July we passed the 1 billion mark for the year. Again, our intention is to repurchase at least 2 billion over the course of this year. Our capital spending was on target at $8.5 billion for the first six months with both wireline and wireless right where we expected them to be. You see the improvement in our CapEx to revenue ratio this year compared to last. ", "Let's begin our segment review with wireless on slide 6. As you know, the retail market is our key focus. More customers use Verizon Wireless than any other wireless brand. We had another strong quarter of customer growth with more than 1.6 million retail net adds, increasing our retail customer base to 60.1 million or 96.8% of total. Retail postpaid customer grew 1.5 million to 57.7 million. ", "We continued our industry leadership in customer loyalty. Retail churn was 1.08%, and retail postpaid churn was a record low, 0.85%. Retail gross adds increased 2.2% year over year and were up nearly a 1% sequentially with more than two-thirds of these retail sales coming from direct channels. Total net adds for the quarter, including wholesale, were 1.3 million. During the quarter the wholesale customer base declined by about 300,000 primarily due to one reseller. We have removed all customers associated with this reseller from our subscriber counts this quarter. ", "Turning to slide 7, total service revenues were up 17% in the second quarter, sustaining our strong growth trends and marking the sixth consecutive quarter of better than 15% year-over-year growth. Retail service ARPU of $51.84 was up 3% year over year and 2.2% sequentially. This growth is the highest we have seen in the past two years. ", "Data products and services continue to be a significant driver of growth. In fact, more than half of the growth in total service revenues was from data. Data revenues grew 70% year-over-year and represented 19% of total service revenue, up from 13% a year ago. Retail data ARPU grew to $9.84, up 48% from a year ago. Almost two-thirds of our retail customers are data users. More than one-third of all retail data revenues came from business applications, and nearly 60% of our data revenue growth was from services other than messaging. ", "During the quarter customers using our VCast service completed about 25 million music and video downloads. Customers sent or received over 28 billion text messages in the second quarter with 10 billion in the month of June alone. ", "Verizon Wireless continues to lead the industry in retail customers, total revenue, customer loyalty and profitability. As you can see on slide 8, we have sustained a steady growth trajectory in revenues which were $10.8 billion in the second quarter. Quarterly EBITDA was well in excess of $4 billion, up 8% sequentially and 21% since last year. Our second quarter EBITDA margin was a very strong 45.8%, and we intend to sustain our leadership by differentiating ourselves from the competition. ", "Earlier this month we announced that we have expanded Rev. A to 100% of our EV-DO footprint, which covers more than 210 million pops. In May we introduced our global BlackBerry service and the new BlackBerry 8830 world addition. Both of these have been extremely well-received as we are getting great feedback from customers, particularly business travelers. We have enhanced our music capabilities with VCast Online service, which enables over-the-air recognition of tunes for digital downloading, and our VCast Mobile TV service is now available in more than 30 markets. All-in-all another excellent quarter for wireless. ", "Within wireline we had a strong quarter of residential customer growth, particularly with our FiOS services. We also saw some line loss improvement. In FiOS TV we added 167,000 net new customers to end the quarter with 515,000, a penetration of more than 13%. That is an average of about 2,600 net adds per business day this quarter. When you add in our DirecTV bundled customers, we now have nearly 1.3 million video subscribers. At the end of the quarter, we were marketing our FiOS TV service to about 3.9 million homes, up from 3.1 million at the end of first quarter and our FiOS TV ARPUs remain within industry norms. ", "We are also doing well with our FiOS Internet service. We added 203,000 net new FiOS Internet customers this quarter, which is about 15% more net adds than in the first quarter. We now have 1.1 million customers representing a penetration of 19% of homes open for sale. During the quarter, we averaged about 3,200 net adds per business day. Six of our state markets have FiOS Internet penetration rates over 20% and one state exceeds 35%. In virtually all markets, except those in which we've just introduced the service, we reached double-digit penetration. ", "Total broadband subscribers increased to 7.7 million in the second quarter, up 1.6 million or about 26% from a year ago. During the quarter there were 288,000 net broadband heads. As I noted, 203,000 of these net adds were FiOS Internet customers. Although we usually see seasonally slower DSL net adds in the second quarter, this quarter's 85,000 DSL net adds were lower than consensus. However, as we continue to scale up the availability of FiOS, some reduction in DSL volumes should be expected. Overall about 22% of FiOS Internet sales are migrations up from DSL service. ", "Overall FiOS TV and broadband, as well as our bundling initiatives, are improving customer growth trends. The total number of primary consumer units grew 2% year-over-year, and we ended the quarter with 32.4 million total RGUs, which are up on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. We have also seen an increase in retail residential bundled customers this past year. Clearly broadband and video products have proven to be more retentive, and we have seen some improvement in line losses this quarter, which is certainly a change from recent trends. The amount of total quarterly line losses have improved by 15% since the second quarter last year. On a percentage basis, the 7.8% year-over-year decline is also slightly better than last quarter. ", "Of note, the improvements were in retail lines and can be attributed to an aggressive retention program as well as win-back efforts. More specifically, retail residential line losses have improved sequentially on both an absolute and percentage basis. During the quarter, we lost 579,000 lines or 9.2% year over year. This compares with 619,000 lines or 9.3% at the end of first quarter. Clearly we see a correlation between FiOS penetration and line loss improvements in some markets. ", "Our consumer retail business is increasingly centered on broadband, video and bundles. As I mentioned earlier, our legacy consumer revenue growth was positive again this quarter, increasing 3.4%, more than doubling the rate of growth in first quarter. Broadband and video revenues grew 55% this quarter compared with the year ago. Last quarter that growth rate was 46%. ", "Increases in broadband and video revenue, more bundled customers, as well as certain strategic pricing changes all helped drive consumer retail ARPU up $5.64 or nearly 11% year over year. The 3.3% sequential growth in ARPU is primarily broadband and video-related. In Texas the retail ARPU growth was in excess of 20%, and there are several other large markets with double-digit growth including New York, New Jersey and Virginia. We continue to see growth and retention opportunities in the retail consumer market, particularly as we introduced new bundles, many of which will include wireless. ", "Let's turn now to Verizon Business on slide 11 where we are taking advantage of the positive trends in the large enterprise market to increase market share. In discussions with investors over the past few months, there seems to be less focus here than any of our other units. Our opportunities in this market should not be overlooked. Verizon Business revenues now represent 23% of our consolidated year-to-date total; which, by the way, is about 40% larger than our legacy consumer unit and there is significant upside potential here. ", "Our 2.4% revenue increase is the third consecutive quarter of positive year-over-year revenue growth, and we're seeing this growth across all units: enterprise, wholesale and international. In enterprise, which includes premier multinational customers as well as domestic and government accounts, revenues grew to $3.7 billion, up 2.7% sequentially and 2.8% year over year. Wholesale revenues, which are domestic only, grew 1.6% since last year to $844 million. International revenues, which includes services from non U.S.-based retail and wholesale customers, were just under $800 million, up 1.3% year over year. ", "Strategic services posted a 25.5% revenue increase over last year. As you can see on slide 12, strategic services is also showing strong sequential growth, increasing 9.3% over first quarter. This grouping of services which includes IP, managed services, as well as Ethernet and optical ring services, are becoming a much more larger percentage of total Verizon Business, currently representing 24% of total, up from 19% a year ago. ", "We saw strong growth in a number of products including private IP, contact center solutions and Ethernet services. Revenues also increased in managed services like enhanced 911, IP VPN and security solutions. The year-over-year growth in strategic services revenues exceeded the decline in core service revenues for the second consecutive quarter. We believe this is significant, and we are very focused on continuing this trend. ", "As noted last quarter, the impact of rate writedowns from renewal contracts is improving; nearly a 40% reduction in the rate of decline from a year ago. With the majority of our customers transitioning to IP, we see significant opportunities to increase our market share. We believe we are very well-positioned to take advantage of the global demand for IP, managed services, security and hosting. ", "The wireline business model continues to evolve. Even though we have fewer customers in total, we have increased the revenue or value per customer. This has resulted in improved revenue growth. Revenues have continued to show steady improvement as the year-over-year rate of decline has lessened each quarter. Second quarter revenues declined 1.1%, a significant top line improvement from a 6.2% decline a year ago. Excluding former MCI mass market, wireline revenues actually increased 0.6%. ", "As in wireless, data services are a big driver of growth in wireline revenues. Data now represents 35% of total wireline revenues. This quarter data revenues grew an impressive 11.6%. Our wireline operating income margins were essentially flat on a sequential basis and down 60 basis points versus last year. The year-over-year change is due primarily to FiOS customer growth and the cost of provisioning significantly more new customers in the current quarter than a year ago. ", "Our focus on growth by driving ARPU and improving customer retention carried with it some higher marketing and advertising costs this quarter, when viewed on a sequential basis. We are sharply focused on driving continuous improvements in our cost structure, not only in FiOS provisioning but throughout the entire wireline unit. We continue to target margin expansion in 2007 and beyond. FiOS earnings declined sequentially to $0.10. We are pleased with our progress in this area and expect productivity improvement to continue as we gain scale. ", "A few concluding comments, and then we will answer questions. Growth is accelerating in all our key markets. Two-thirds of our revenues now come from wireless and global business. As I said earlier, 90% of our revenue base is growing. In the consumer market, our broadband, video and bundling initiatives are driving ARPU expansion and improving retention. We are building very positive momentum in FiOS, and we have many growth opportunities ahead of us. We're making good progress in improving profitability. We still have work to do, but wireless margins remain the highest in the industry. Our strong balance sheet gives us the financial flexibility to invest in growth initiatives and return capital to shareowners. ", "In summary, we are very pleased with our second-quarter and first-half results, making us very confident as we enter the second half of the year. With that, I will turn it back to Ron so we can answer your questions. ", " Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Ivan, Denny and Doreen are now available to take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse. ", " Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "Thanks and good morning. A couple of questions on the Rural Cellular transaction, if you don't mind. Ivan, I think you said in your comments that they wanted to get the transaction wrapped up by this weekend. Is there anything specific of why that had to be done? ", "Secondly, how was the transaction going to be structured in relation to how it impacts the Vodafone relationship? Will this be all-cash out of Verizon Wireless and it does not change that? ", "Third, Doreen, on the synergies that you outlined of about $1 billion, can you break those synergies down between the roaming synergies and the actual operating call synergies that might come out of that? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "I will deal with that, Chris. On the first question, I think they had a process that has been open since May, and I think they felt that they wanted to get it completed. I think they had indicated they were looking to close it during the window prior to August 10 or 11, I believe. So there was nothing unusual as far as we were concerned, and we were able to move quickly and seize the opportunity. But I think this was really driven by the seller, and you might check with them, but we detected nothing unusual about it. ", "This will be an acquisition made by Verizon Wireless, and Vodafone enthusiastically supported it. We obviously covered it with them at a Verizon Wireless board meeting. ", "At this point, it is probably premature on the synergy question. I think we have over $1 billion. Over the course of the next six to eight months, it will be clear what that breakdown might look like, but you should expect that the vast majority of those savings will come from savings in roaming. ", " Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "A second one on the wireless side. Data ARPU continues to grow very rapidly. Could you give us as sense for what the ARPU growth might be without data cards? Are the data cards, the EV-DO cards, a big driver of the data growth, or is it mostly the messaging? ", "Denny Strigl", "It is mostly the messaging at this point. ", " Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns. ", " Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns ", "On the consumer side, just looking at the revenue growth opportunity there, how much longer do we have before the old MCI legacy consumer stuff rolls off? ", "Second on the enterprise side, I guess the trend there is slowing down a bit. So maybe you can give us a sense for the puts and takes there whether it is product mix shift that is impacting that or contract repricing really hit in the past quarter? Thanks. ", "Doreen Toben", "I will start with the consumer piece of it. They have sort of been down 25 to 30% each quarter. I think this is going to continue to roll at those kinds of levels into '08 and probably into '09. So it will take actually a couple of years before we think it rolls off in total. ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Mike, if you look overall at the VZB revenue growth, market and customer spending trends continue to be strong. We have completed over 50% of the IP migration, and after the migration, we're seeing stronger revenues. We are also, as we reported last quarter, seeing longer contracts with less pricing pressures, and we see improved global opportunities as we continue to focus on the multinational accounts. ", " Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns ", "Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America Securities. ", " David Barden - Banc of America Securities ", "Just on the consumer wireline, legacy wireline business, a couple of important inflections. One is on the line losses. I am wondering if you believe that that is related to a saturation effect in market share, if you will, the beginning of a saturation effect and whether you expect this can continue? The same question on DSL. Big slowdown there, obviously seasonal trends; probably people are waiting around for FiOS to show up, but are you starting to see some saturation there? ", "If I can ask a follow-up on that prior question on business. A lot of questions about where we are in the business cycle, Denny. Are we seeing the enterprise business start to roll over, or are we seeing some incremental strength? Are we building or diminishing on that segment? Thanks a lot. ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "David, several questions there. Let me again begin with the access line loss question. First, I would say that access lines did not improve enough, and we continue to be focused on improving our access line losses. The improvement that we did experience was not unexpected. It comes from a rollout of FiOS and bundles and a great focus in the business on retention and win back. So we expect to lose fewer lines. ", "Looking at the DSL question, I agree that 85,000 net adds were lighter than what they should have been this quarter. As Doreen mentioned, as FiOS scales up, we do expect to see a reduction in DSL volumes. But I would also add that DSL was frankly not our focus this quarter. We quickly moved and trained service reps, installation forces that normally handled DSL, we moved them to FiOS in some markets like New Jersey, California, Florida, also Indiana toward the end of the quarter. So overall we expect broadband net adds to continue to grow, and we will roll out FiOS just as fast as we can. We are also back-filling on the DSL side, the service reps and the installation forces that we move. So our expectation is going forward more focus and better DSL results. ", "On the enterprise side, you ask if the business cycle is rollover or incremental. I think as we said last quarter, we are not the market share leader in the business market so we are tending to take more share from our competitors. I think this is a good story for us. We are seeing some rollover signup business, but frankly we have got some very good growth opportunity in taking share from our competitors. ", "David Barden - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik - UBS. ", " John Hodulik - UBS ", "Thanks, good morning. Just a quick question on wireline margins. Doreen, during your remarks you mentioned that you were going to focus on some cost cutting. We also saw the FiOS dilution come down in the quarter. Can you give a little bit of a forward-looking view of how would you expect that to trend? I know that you've got quite a bit lower EBITDA margins than some of your wireline compatriots. How do you expect that to trend, not only through the end of the year but maybe into '08 as well? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Okay. John, if we look at the overall margins, they were flat, even given the lower FiOS dilution that we experienced. So they were flat sequentially, but this was not unexpected. And, in fact, we have said that we would see some lumpiness in our margins. As Doreen mentioned, we have been accelerating growth in our legacy consumer services in the small business and also in enterprise. Although some of the expenses were up for the quarter, marketing expenses in particular, I am confident that we will continue to drive our top line growth to the bottom line. We continue to be very focused on improvement in productivity and also cost reductions going forward. ", " John Hodulik - UBS ", "Are those marketing expenses expected to continue to reoccur throughout the rest of the year, or is it just a second quarter issue? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "No, it is not a second quarter issue. Our marketing expenses will be up probably on the level like we have seen in the second quarter. But I also think that our continued productivity improvements and cost reductions we will continue to see in the third and fourth quarter of this year. ", " John Hodulik - UBS ", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley. ", " Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley ", "Thanks a lot, good morning. Doreen, very strong wireless margins. You have given a guidance range here of the mid-40s, low-40s over the last several quarters. Is there a chance here that we can -- if the trend stays down here -- take that margin up to a new higher range, or is this sort of the upper end of the range and it will stabilize from here in the second half? ", "Doreen Toben", "Hi Simon. No, I think we're going to stay with our 43% to 45% margin and guidance, so no change to that really. ", " Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley ", "So what was it this quarter that sort of gave you the particularly strong numbers that will reverse next quarter? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "I think, as you have seen in our number, our growth was 1.6; subtract from it the 300,000 in the reseller side, but frankly we had a little bit lower growth than what we had anticipated. ", " Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley ", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs. ", " Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple of follow-ups on Rural Cellular and then one on the auction. On Rural Cellular, can you talk about how this impacts dividend timing out of Verizon Wireless? You've talked about 2009 as an estimated timeframe before for implementing the dividend again. Was there an assumption in there for this type of deal? I know there were assumptions built around auctions expanding there, so does this sort of delay the timing beyond 2009? ", "A second question on Rural Cellular. You are migrating a large amount of GSM subs over to CDMA. We have seen this be problematic before in the industry. What gives you confidence here that this process will be seamless? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "On the first question is this transaction is not all that gigantic. So I think when you look at the dividends, it will not impact it materially. I think that when we talked this over with Vodafone, they understood that quite correctly. Their assumption on the dividends is, I think the way they look at it has been accurate. I think absent other changes to what we do with Verizon Wireless, they have been anticipating free cash flow opportunities. So I think the way you should think about this, Jason, is that our first goal -- and it always has been -- is to continue to grow both the top line and the bottom line of Verizon Wireless. I think in this case we can deploy capital better by reinvesting in the business than moving toward a quicker dividend. I think the 2009 timing could be impacted, but it is too soon to really determine the exact date of that. ", "I think on the build what gives us the view of this, I could say this and I will say it very clearly, I don't think that Verizon Wireless misses many operating targets or misses the opportunity to do these integrations. They have done probably 60 or 70 of them over the course of the last four or five years. So I think they will be careful, and they will look at it very carefully. Remember, we're going to do something on a dual basis here. We will continue to run the GSM network so that we can take care of roaming partners, and at the same time, we will have a careful transition of new customers onto the CDMA network. ", " Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ", "That is great. Just one follow-up question on the auctions related to accepting the new rules last week, can you just sort of walk us through the perspective there? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Well, I think there is a couple of things. First of all, there is a block of spectrum is going to be auctioned off. Assuming it looks roughly like the AWS spectrum, there could be four or five licenses per market. We have made our position clear about the FCC not putting any unnecessary restrictions on any of these blocks. What we need to do now is see what the rules say and then develop a bidding strategy accordingly. I think it should be obvious to most people that the reason we're interested in the spectrum is it is attractive spectrum in the right bands and that we have had such extraordinary growth over the last few years that we tend to put the spectrum to use pretty quickly. ", "So we will just take a wait and see attitude, and I think that we will be in a position to decide how and whether we bid on any portions of any of the licenses that are open, and we will see how this unfolds during the year. ", " Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ", "Great, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup. ", " Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup", "Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you can give us an update on the MCI integration process with respect to how the profit contribution is comparing to your original numbers? Within that context, as the integration continues, is there a point where MCI margins can take a significant step upwards? Thanks. ", "Doreen Toben", "As far as the original guidance that we gave in synergies, we're actually on target and really ahead of target, so no issue there. We have done extremely well. We are very quick to move all the traffic onto our own network, which gave us an awful lot of the synergies very quickly. We have done a lot of things between the wireline and wireless to give us even more synergies. ", "What was the second part of your question? ", " Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup", "As the integration continues, can margins take a step function up at some point from where they are today? ", "Doreen Toben", "Absolutely. I think what we said coming in was that MCI was at very low margins compared to their peers and we think over the next two and three years their margins will significantly improve. We have talked to you before about the fact that we're investing in what we call our 10-point plan to reduce access costs this year. We are heavily into that. We're doing some trunking and rearrangements in co-location cases, which will give us an opportunity to significantly increase our margin going forward. ", " Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch. ", " David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch ", "Denny, you had mentioned some of the productivity and cost reduction initiatives and you continue with some of the organizational alignments, the latest being the CTL. At the corporate level, you have talked about common platform and processes. Can you update us on any initiatives, targets or timeframes related to overall productivity? ", "Denny Strigl", "We continue to focus on the productivity gains, both in our customers\u2019 premises and in our garages, preparing our installation crews to get out to do the work. We have also in some of our jurisdictions been adding a lower-paid technician. Frankly, we have appointed a new executive this last week. I think you saw the appointment of Dick Lynch. Dick will be focused on all three of our networks, productivity gains and cost efficiencies, and I think you will see further improvement going forward. ", " David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch ", "Any specifics you can give us on some of the initiatives? ", "Denny Strigl", "Not in this call. ", " David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch ", "Just one last one. Can you update us on the FairPoint process? ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Yes, I will do that. The FairPoint process has moved along. I think you know we have a shareholders meeting scheduled for August 22 I believe it is, so they have cleared the SEC. We have gotten the documents out. They are going to have a shareholder meeting. There's lots of activity in all three Northern states. To us this is all part of the process, and we will work through all the issues. FairPoint is doing a good job at making its case, and we're doing what we need to do to support them. ", "So the next step will be shareholder approval, and what we are looking for is almost all of the decisions by the Public Service Commission should be completed late this year. So we are looking for hopefully a late this year, early next year close on this transaction. ", " David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch ", "Thanks. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers. ", " Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers ", "Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on wireline margins. Can you tell us where you are at in the process of deploying the $300 million in CapEx related to bringing down access charges? I imagine the strength in enterprise sales, while you're still paying more access than you want, hurts the margin here in the near term. I am wondering if you will give us some sort of timing as to when we will start to see that savings flow through? ", "A second question, I know it is not this quarter but I think everyone is interested. Can you give us some idea as to porting activity in wireless, whether a certain other carrier perhaps is getting more ports or whether they did for the first two weeks in July and maybe that slowed down? Thanks. ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Let me begin first, Tom, with your last question. We did see an impact in our porting rates for a short period of time. But in the last week, we returned to a net positive position against all of our competitors. In fact, we are now back to approximately two customers are in for every customer that we lose. ", "The first part of your question was the $300 million in CapEx? ", "Doreen Toben", "We are not quite halfway through that program. As you would expect, that is really capital not so much an expense, and it takes some time to capture those savings. So I would say we are very early into getting the benefits in the first half of the year from those. The bigger impact will come in '08. We will start to see some, especially in the fourth quarter, smaller in the third quarter, but the real big impact I would say comes much more in '08. ", " Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers ", "Great, thank you very much. ", "Ron Lataille", "Operator, I would like to now hand the call over to Ivan Seidenberg for some concluding remarks. ", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Thanks, Ron. Just a couple of quick comments. I think when we look at the quarter, we are all very pleased with the fact that we sustained and built on our excellent momentum on the top line. So we have been deploying capital and making investments internally to create the kind of organic momentum that Doreen and Denny talked about here. That has also converted itself into some double-digit EPS growth, which is for us two quarters in a row a good milestone for us. ", "A lot of questions on this call about margins, so just let me comment from my perspective on this. I think what you are hearing, and all the questions are really very good. Our view on this is that the margin issue will continue to improve. You need to develop momentum on this. I think we have develop momentum on the top line, and I think as we make investments in IT and the network and marketing and improve productivity as Denny said, and start to deal with a lot of the longer-term synergy opportunities from the transaction with MCI, we will see this pick up momentum as we head into late '07 and into '08. But this is an issue of momentum. I think first you get the momentum on the top line, and then I think you will start to see momentum on the margin line. Nevertheless, we still had double-digit earnings growth this quarter, and we're making good progress. ", "I would also make the comment that we are in a situation where we have the best balance sheet we have ever had in our company. I think that gives us enormous flexibility, particularly in light of all of the recent crunches in the credit markets and all the things that are going on. So this has given us the ability to reduce debt. It has given us the ability to make a couple of transactions here, with CyberTrust and now Rural. So I think that we have the opportunity to acquire strategic assets to sustain both top line and EPS growth. ", "I think it also gives us a chance -- and Doreen will do this over the course of the next six months -- to think about new ways of improving returns to shareholders, given the place that the company is in. So all of the growth services that we have in wireless, broadband and managed network services in our three units are doing well. In our Verizon services organization, which basically focuses on productivity improvements and management of our infrastructure, they are also gaining momentum as we head into the year. ", "So we feel very good halfway through the year that we are positioned the way we want to be positioned, and we are very focused on increasing returns to shareholders and driving our stock price to continue to move in the right direction.

(Operator Instructions). It is now my pleasure to turn thecall over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President of InvestorRelations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", " Good morning andwelcome to our third quarter 2007 earnings conference call. Thanks for joiningus this morning. I am Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, ourPresident and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Toben, our Chief FinancialOfficer.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earningsrelease, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and thepresentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is beingwebcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from ourwebsite.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information inthis presentation contains statements about expected future events andfinancial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained inVerizon's filings with the SEC which are available on our website.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financialmeasures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directlycomparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of ourresults, I would like to cover the differences between reported and adjustedearnings for the third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.44.Adjusted earnings, or EPS before the effects of special items, were $0.63. ", "There are three special items which we are excluding fromadjusted results:", "The first is a $471 million or $0.16 per share charge forinternational taxes and related expenses that would be payable as a result ofpossible distributions from our Vodafone Omnitel investment. We're estimatingthat our portion of their distributable earnings may amount to as much as $2.5billion pre-tax over the next 12 months.", "The second item is a $44 million after-tax charge, or $0.02per share, for costs incurred in connection with the spin-off of access linesin Maine, New  Hampshire and Vermont.These costs, which we are excluding as non-operational, are mostly related tonetwork, software and other activities which will enable the impactedfacilities and systems to function on a standalone basis. We will continue toincur these types of costs between now and closing, so you can expect a similarspecial item to be excluded from our results next quarter.", "The last item is the $28 million, or $0.01 per share, chargefor MCI merger integration costs.", "With that I will now turn the call over to Doreen.", "Doreen Toben", "Thanks, Ron and good morning, everyone. Before we get intothe numbers, I would like to make a few observations. The third quarter wasanother very solid quarter for us. All key growth areas of the businessperformed well. Wireless and FiOS customer growth was particularly strong.Verizon business revenues increased once again, and we continue to makeimprovements in wireline revenues and margins. Our results once againdemonstrate the focus we have on accelerating customer and revenue growth,controlling costs and expanding margins.", "Consolidated revenues increased to $23.8 billion thisquarter, up 6% year over year and more than 2% sequentially. Our operatingincome margins expanded to 18.1% as operating income increased 18.5% year over yearand more than 3% sequentially. ", "As for earnings, this is our third consecutive quarter ofdouble-digit growth in adjusted EPS from continuing operations. Our $0.63compared with $0.55 a year ago, up 14.5%. Year-to-date, EPS from continuingoperations have increased 13.6%.", "Let's take a closer look at consolidated revenues andmargins. Our accelerating revenue growth has resulted in a $500 millionsequential increase and a $1.3 billion year-over-year improvement. During thethird quarter, we saw strong top line performance in our key growth areas.Verizon wireless revenues were up 14.4%, legacy consumer revenues grew 3.1% andVerizon business revenues increased 2.2% compared to a year ago. This revenuegrowth has resulted in higher ARPU and margin expansion.", "In addition, productivity initiatives are helping to reshapeour cost structure. On slide 4 you can see the operating income marginimprovement. Of note, both wireless and wireline are contributing to positiveoperating income growth. Our third quarter operating margin of 18.1% represents190 basis point improvement over the same quarter a year ago. ConsolidatedEBITDA was 33.3% or 100 basis points better than a year ago; so very profitablegrowth as we drive the business to accelerate revenues, increase ARPU andexpand margins.", "Our cash flows from continuing operations remain strong. Ouryear-to-date totaled $18 billion, representing 5% growth over last year. Wehave continued to repurchase shares. During the quarter we repurchased nearly $800million of our common stock. Through nine months, we have bought back more than$1.7 billion. Our capital spending remains on target at $12.8 billion for thefirst nine months with both wireline and wireless right where we expected themto be.", "Now let's look at our segment results beginning with Verizonwireless on slide 6. Inwireless, our key focus is on the retail market, and we have sustained ourindustry leadership. As we have said before, more customers use Verizon wirelessthan any other wireless brand. We had another strong quarter of customer growthwith 1.8 million retail net adds. We are up to 61.8 million retail customers,which is more than 97% of our total customer base. Almost all the retail netadds were postpaid. Retail postpaid customers grew 1.7 million to 59.4 millionthis quarter.", "I would also highlight our continued leadership in customerloyalty. Retail churn was 1.21%, and retail postpaid churn was 0.96%, bothseasonally higher on a sequential basis. Postpaid churn was essentially flatyear over year. Retail gross add performance was very strong, up 12.3% sequentiallyand 3.8% year over year with more than two-thirds of these retail sales comingfrom direct channels. Total net adds for the quarter, including wholesale, were1.6 million.", "Turning to slide 7, total service revenues were up 15.1% inthe third quarter, sustaining our strong growth trend. Retail service revenues,which comprised nearly 98% of total service, grew 15.9%. Retail service ARPU of$52.17 was up nearly $1 year over year and $0.33 sequentially. Data revenuesgrew 63% year over year and now represent more than 20% of total servicerevenue, up from 14.1% one year ago.", "Retail data ARPU grew to $10.59, up 43% from a year ago.About 68% of our retail customers are data users. More than 35% of retail datarevenues come from business applications driven by laptop AIR cards and email.Quarterly revenues from these applications are showing strong sequential growthand were up nearly 74% compared with a year ago. ", "Messaging revenues, which make up just less than half of allof our retail data, continue to grow steadily, up 58% versus last year. Duringthe quarter, customers sent or received more than 36 billion text messages, upfrom 28 billion in the second quarter. Data applications such as Get It Now, VCast,mobile web and ringback tones are also generating significant growth. ", "Verizon wireless continues to lead the industry in retailcustomers, total revenue, customer loyalty and profitability. On slide 8 youcan see steady increase in quarterly revenues, now well in excess of $11billion. In terms of the data opportunity, while we are seeing strong demand,we certainly see more upside. For example, only a little more than half of ourretail customers have a broadband capable device. ", "We have recently previewed some great new devices -- the LGVoyager and Venus, the Samsung Juke and the world's first high-speed BlackBerryPearl. These and other devices will be part of our strongest lineup ever forthe fourth quarter. In August we announced an innovative partnership with MTVand RealNetworks which will further differentiate our mobile music service. ", "Our EBITDA was $4.4 billion this quarter, up 14.3% sincelast year and our EBITDA margin was a very strong 44.7%. All in all, anotherexcellent quarter for Verizon wireless.", "Let's move to wireline. Within wireline we had a strongquarter of residential customer growth, particularly with our FiOS services. InFiOS TV we added 202,000 net new customers this quarter, about 21% more thanour second quarter net adds. That is an average of about 3,200 net adds perbusiness day for the quarter. ", "As of September 30, we were marketing FiOS TV service toabout 4.7 million homes, up from 3.9 million at the end of the second quarter.We now have 717,000 TV customers representing a penetration of more than 15%.In virtually all of our regional markets we have achieved double-digitpenetration and in one region, our TV penetration exceeds 30%.", "With respect to revenues, our FiOS TV ARPU has increasedconsistently each quarter and compares well to industry norms. We are alsoseeing great customer acceptance of FiOS Internet service. During the thirdquarter, we added 229,000 net new FiOS Internet customers, representing about a13% increase over last quarter and an average of about 3,600 net adds perbusiness day. We now have 1.3 million FiOS Internet customers, representing apenetration of 20% of the 6.5 million homes open for sale. In all of ourregions, we have reached penetration rates of 13% or better with two-thirds ofour regions exceeding 20% penetration.", "Last week we announced the new symmetrical FiOS Internetservice featuring upload and download speeds of up to 20 Mbps. This uploadspeed is unmatched with nothing else even close. ", "Total broadband subscribers increased to 8 million in thethird quarter, up 1.4 million or about 21% from a year ago. During the quarter,there were 285,000 net broadband adds. As I noted, 229,000 of these net addswere FiOS Internet customers. Our DSL net adds this quarter were 56,000.Overall, FiOS TV and broadband, as well as our bundling initiatives, areresulting in net customer growth.", "The total number of primary consumer units grew 1.8% year overyear, and we ended the quarter with 32.3 million total RGUs which were modestlyhigher than a year ago. On an absolute basis, our total line losses thisquarter increased sequentially, but were fewer than the amount we lost in thethird quarter last year.", "Retail residential line losses of 664,000 were more than welost last quarter but are 4.5% less than we lost a year ago. Today, about 72%of the 6.5 million FiOS homes open for sale can get the triple play from us. Aswe continue to increase the availability of FiOS TV, we are seeing anincreasing correlation to improve line retention. ", "We are encouraged by the fact that in highly penetratedvideo markets, access line retention is significantly better. Take Rhode  Island, for example. We began offering FiOS TV inparts of the state earlier this year. In those markets where we offer FiOS TV,we are actually seeing access line gains; where only six months ago we werelosing lines in excess of 10% annually.", "Our consumer retail business is increasingly centered onbroadband, video and bundles. As you can see on slide 10, our legacy consumerrevenue growth was positive again this quarter, increasing 3.1%. Year-to-date,legacy consumer revenues have increased by about $300 million. Increases inbroadband and video revenue and an increase in the number of bundled customershave all helped drive consumer retail ARPU up $5.73 or nearly 11% year over year.All of our regional markets had sequential ARPU accretion. ", "In total, broadband and video revenues were up 67% thisquarter compared with a year ago. Last quarter the year-over-year growth ratewas 55%. We continue to see growth and retention opportunities as we increasetriple play availability, and we have begun adding wireless to the mix. Inearly October we announced some great new home and wireless bundles.", "Now let's take a lot at Verizon business on slide 11. Wecontinue to see strong growth in data demand and some stabilization in voicepricing. Our 2.2% revenue increase is the fourth consecutive quarter ofpositive year-over-year revenue growth. In enterprise -- which includes premiermultinational customers, domestic and government accounts -- revenues grew to$3.7 billion, up 2.4% year over year and 1.3% sequentially. ", "Wholesale domestic revenues grew 3.7% year over year,primarily due to increases in wireless traffic. International revenues, whichinclude both retail and wholesale, were $789 million. This is the same as lastquarter and down $4 million versus last year. Retail revenues increased, butwere offset by volume declines in wholesale. ", "Strategic services showed strong revenue growth again thisquarter, up 28.6% versus last year and 8% higher on a sequential basis. Growthwas driven by private IP, managed services and security. Strategic services arebecoming a much larger piece of the overall revenue stream. It is now more than25% of total Verizon business, up from 20% a year ago. With the majority of ourcustomers transitioning to IP, we continue to see significant opportunities toincrease our market share. We believe we are very well-positioned to takeadvantage of the global demand for IP, managed services, security and hosting.", "Overall, we believe this quarter provides further evidencethat our strategies are paying off in the wireline business. On the residentialside, even though line losses continue, we have successfully increased revenueper customer, which has resulted in improved revenue growth. In Verizon business,we continue to win new business and increase market share. ", "And as you can see on slide 12, wireline revenues havecontinued to show steady improvement as the year-over-year rate of decline haslessened each quarter. Third quarter revenues declined 0.8%; excluding formerMCI mass-market, wireline revenues actually increased 0.9%. As in wireless, dataservices are a big driver of revenue growth. Data now represents 37% of total wirelinerevenue. This quarter, data revenues were up 13% year over year.", "In terms of profitability, third quarter wireline operatingincome margins expanded 60 basis points year over year and 40 basis pointssequentially to 9.4%. Margin expansion is being driven by revenue growth, aswell as a number of productivity initiatives currently underway.", "Wireline headcount is down more than 2,800 for the year.FiOS earnings solution declined sequentially to $0.09. We are pleased with ourprogress in improving installation productivity and expect to see betterefficiencies as we gain scale. So we're making good progress in improvingprofitability.", "So let's wrap this up and get to your questions. If I take astep back and look at the big picture, I would say that our focus on revenuegrowth, productivity and margin expansion is clearly taking hold. Our growth inearnings from continuing operations is solidly in the double-digits. All keygrowth areas are performing well. ", "Wireless had another strong quarter in terms of profitablerevenue and customer growth, as well as strong cash generation. In wireline,revenues and margins continue to improve. In the consumer market, ourbroadband, video and bundling initiatives are driving ARPU expansion and demandfor our FiOS services has never been better. We are well positioned to increasemarket share and capitalize on growth opportunities in Verizon business. ", "Our strong balance sheet gives us the financial flexibilityto continue investing for growth and at the same time return capital toshareowners. In September we raised the dividend by 6.2% or $0.10 annually, aclear indication of the confidence we have in our cash outlook. We haveincreased our share repurchase program target to at least $2.5 billion for thefull year, up about $500 million from our original guidance. ", "In sum, good progress in key strategic areas and we arepleased with our third quarter and year-to-date results. ", "With that, I will turn it back to Ron.", "Ron Lataille", "Thanks, Doreen. Operator, Denny and Doreen are now availableto take questions.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "Your first question comes from David Barden - Banc ofAmerica Securities.", "David Barden  - Banc of America Securities", "First on the wireline margins, up it looks like 50 basispoints sequentially. Is it all just incremental FiOS revenues that are movingthe margin up there? What are the moving parts behind that margin? Asimportantly, where do you think that those wireline margins can go over thenext year?", "If you could just talk to the FCC talking about getting ridof the exclusive contracts between cable companies and multi-tenant dwellingunit landlords. Is that a barrier to getting more aggressive in the MDUfootprint with the FiOS product, or are there still technological barriers tobe overcome? Thanks a lot.", "Denny Strigl", " I will handle both ofthose. First of all, on the margin question, obviously we have made progressthis quarter. We saw margins better than the last quarter. But to be candidwith you, I'm not satisfied with that. We are working to improve our marginsevery day and I am confident that we will see continued improvement. The teamis very focused on productivity improvements and overall reduction in cost.", "So looking at the opportunities that we have to improvemargins, FiOS metrics were on target to be EBITDA positive in '08. Reducingaccess costs in Verizon Business will also help. We will get our EBITDA marginsto at least 14% to 15% in the next couple of years. Also, we have some cost reductionopportunities across the business, including real estate, procurement sourcingand through IT in aggressively transforming some of the transaction-relatedoperations. So for the fourth quarter and '08, we are very focused oncontinuing to drive growth, top line revenues and overall increasing ourmargins.", "On the MDU issue, there really are no technology areas thatare in our way in MDUs. The issues for us with MDUs are first to get a premiseaccess license arrangement. That is, permission to get into a building withFiOS. Secondly, with the landlords marketing agreement, that is the ability tomarket within the building. Finally, to sign up customers. Of course, all ofthis is gated upon our ability to get a video franchise.", "Some statistics you may be interested in, about 25% of our accesslines are in MDUs. Thus far, we have cast about 2.1 million MDUs, and we haveopened 400,000. We're feeling pretty good about where we stand, and we arelooking for a strong result in '08.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns.", "Mike McCormack  - Bear Stearns", "First on the wireless side, we saw the iPhone price cut in mid-September-ish.Can you give us sense for how your margins reacted throughout the quarter andwhether or not you had a competitive response? More importantly, looking intoQ4 and the holiday season where I think we will have a number of iPhone sales,is there something we should be looking at from your margins as to how you'regoing to respond to that threat?", "Secondly, on the business access lines, it looked like anout of trend, worse than normal quarter, on a year-over-year percentage declinebasis. Is there something there from cable companies, or is there an impactfrom a softer economy we should be thinking about? Thanks.", "Denny Strigl", " On the iPhonequestion, Mike, we have seen minimal impact in the iPhone thus far. We did see,as we mentioned last quarter, an initial jump in our local number portabilityrates and quickly after two to three weeks, back to normal. We saw the sameoccur when the price was lowered on the iPhone. I think as you see from ourchurn number, not appreciably different than what you have seen in other thirdquarters. So relative to iPhone, we don't see any major impact on our business.", "Now as Doreen mentioned in her initial comments, we have avery aggressive fourth quarter planned in terms of introduction of newproducts. A product called the Voyager, which we think will be a very closecompetitive offer to the iPhone; but a number of the other handsets that arebeing introduced in the quarter. I think all are fairly priced, and we lookforward to a good fourth quarter and are not overly concerned about the impactof the iPhone.", "Mike McCormack  - Bear Stearns", "Denny, before we move off wireless, can you just give us anindication of what the wholesale disconnect issue was this quarter?", "Denny Strigl", " We have overall anumber of wholesale customers, but two large ones. The major disconnects havecome from the two major resellers that we have, as you might guess, and it is justan issue on pricing and volumes, Mike. Nothing extraordinary there; as you seeour last few quarters, we have taken some disconnect on the wholesale side. Noreal change in our strategy relative to resellers.", "Doreen Toben", "On the business access line, Mike, what I would say is therewas nothing unusual. There was no big tick-up from competition. I think youhave to be really careful with the business access line number. At least 50% ofit is enterprise, which is really not a relevant measure because there are so manyprivate lines going to DS1s, DS3s or OC12s or whatnot. So nothing unusual thathappened on the business line access line side.", "Mike McCormack  - Bear Stearns", " When you look at thenumbers, you have not had a decline of 3.8% since early 2004. So I just thoughtthat was unusual.", "Doreen Toben", "Yes, but as I said, nothing unusual. I think it is much moreon the enterprise side of the house that it was on the small business side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik - UBS.", "John Hodulik  - UBS", "First on FiOS, the dilution there seems to be coming downabout $0.01 a quarter, and you are obviously sticking with the EBITDA positiveguidance for '08. The changes we should see over the next 12 months, is thatmore a function of scale or improving cost metrics in terms of installationtimes, marketing, that kind of thing?", "Second of all on the business, growth slowed a bit duringthe quarter. Are there any underlying trends we should know about there, or howdo you expect the growth to shape up in that segment over the next 12 months?", "Denny Strigl", "John, on the overall FiOS where do we go from here, I thinkthat we definitely will be ramping up, particularly with a greater number ofhomes passed. Actually, we are rolling out FiOS probably as fast as we can atthis point. We still have some major urban markets to open in the next 18 to 24months, which will significantly expand our opportunities. Frankly, we're notgating our FiOS rollout from a dilution or a franchise perspective.", "So the answer to your question in general is yes, we will beramping FiOS even further with more homes passed. Productivity has improvedacross the board in all of our regions, but there's still more work to do inthat regard.", "Doreen Toben", "I would just add on the FiOS dilution question, you heardthat it is still going to be EBITDA positive in '08. I would say we are ontrack with where we thought we would be, and it is a mix, John. We haveproductivity improvements that will drive the number, as well as the fact asyou continue to get scale. We still have a lot more states and areas that weare opening up, of which the longer that you are in a particular region and youexpand it, your costs come down. So the answer would be a mix.", "Denny Strigl", "John, on the Verizon Business growth, the question that youasked, absolute revenues increased sequentially and the growth rate down onlyabout 10 basis points. In that regard, there's nothing really to note. We arenot seeing any change in our metrics or our sales funnels that would indicate aslowdown. We're encouraged that strategic services continued to show verystrong growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins  - Citigroup", "Good morning. On the DSL, can you talk about the slowdown inDSL out of the FiOS region? What impact FiOS might be having on the straightDSL product? Is it more of an industry or competitive issue? And is it one alsoI guess that could be economic?", "Denny Strigl", "Michael, good morning. We are really not seeing any overalldecline in our broadband metrics, and I think we need to look first at thetotal broadband market rather than just DSL alone. So this quarter we sawcontinued healthy growth in broadband. Broadband subs year over year were up21%. We have 8 million broadband customers in total. We added 285,000 newcustomers this quarter and about 1.4 million over the last 12 months. I thinkDoreen mentioned in her comments that we are adding about 3,600 FiOS Internetsubs per day. In fact, FiOS alone took more than 40,000 DSL subs in the thirdquarter.", "So just a couple of other comments on this. Looking at thepercent of homes covered by FiOS Internet and video, those number of homes areincreasing. FiOS Internet now covers about 20% of households in our footprint.That is up 35% since the beginning of the year, and our availability of FiOSvideo has doubled this year to 15% of households. So overall, we continue toexpect strong broadband growth going forward, and this will particularly relateto the increased coverage that we have.", "Michael Rollins  - Citigroup", "When you look at the FiOS adds only about 20% of that comingfrom DSL, does that mean that you're taking significantly more share from cablecompetition when you're adding high-speed Internet customers to the fiberproduct?", "Denny Strigl", "As you might guess, from cable and also some new to thecategory, but the answer to your question would be yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - MorganStanley.", "Simon Flannery  - Morgan Stanley", "Denny, first on wireless, the cost of services and sales wasup about 8% sequentially. What is driving that? Is that equipment subsidies, orare there other things going on there, some seasonality? ", "Doreen, could you just take us below the operating incomeline and talk about the tax rate? It seems to have come down a bit. What weshould expect for fourth quarter and if there's anything unusual in equity andunconsolidated or other income expense?", "Denny Strigl", "Yes, to answer your question on the wireless costs, that isprimarily handset-driven; obviously greater functionality in the handsets andhigher costs.", "Simon Flannery  - Morgan Stanley", " Should that persistin Q4?", "Denny Strigl", " I think you canexpect this to continue in the fourth quarter.", "Doreen Toben", "On the tax rate, I think we had some out of periodadjustments this quarter. We were able to amend some of our prior tax returns,which allowed us to record a benefit for additional foreign tax credits.  I would say for the full year, I have notchanged the 35% to 37% range. However, in the fourth quarter, you will probablysee a rate that is lower than the average of the first three quarters.  I actually think that you're going to see a 35%to 37% go through 2008 as well. So you will see a little bit of a higher taxrate.", "We can take you through a lot of what is below. Op incomehas to do with CANTV in particular and Omnitel one-timers that happens eitherthis year or last year. CANTV does not book in the same place PRTC orDominicana did. So I think those are the two units that really caused the \u201clooksfunny\u201d that you might see.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan - CIBC.", "Tim Horan  - CIBC", "The wireless data was a very, very strong quarter, probably thestrongest we have seen, maybe ever. Could you give us some more color aroundthat, and where do you think that can get to as a percentage of revenue?", "I might have missed it, but Doreen, could you tell us whatthe FiOS dilution was this year?", "Denny Strigl", "First, if you look at the number of data capable devicescoming into the market this of course, is a big driver. About 50% of our retailsubs currently have a broadband capable device, so we think there is lots ofopportunity there.", "The second driver is also that we're seeing new applicationscoming into the market. Obviously we will see customers increasingly use thoseapplications. We now see about 35% of our retail data revenues coming frombusiness applications, and that is up significantly from the prior year.", "But I might point out that messaging revenues continuestrong growth, about 50% to 60% remarkably each quarter. About 68% of ourretail customers are now data users.", "So to your question, where do we go long term here?Eventually we can see that we may hit the 30% range, and a lot of factors inthat coming into play. The capable handsets, deeper penetration of our productsand a rollout of new services, just to name a few. Our wireless team continuesto be highly focused on growth in data ARPU overall.", "Tim Horan  - CIBC", " But it seems like thetrends, I'm very surprised how strong it has been, but might even be like a 35%longer-term number. I know you're not putting it out there now, but do youthink that is possible?", "Denny Strigl", " It is possible.", "Doreen Toben", " Tim, in case youmissed it, on the FiOS, it was $0.11 first quarter, $0.10 second quarter and$0.09 third quarter.", "Tim Horan  - CIBC", " Can you break thatout EBITDA versus depreciation? Is there any way to get color on that?", "Doreen Toben", " No, I mean we arethinking about whether next year we will just show EBITDA if we show anything,but not off the top of my head as far as that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch.", "David Janazzo  - Merrill Lynch", " A couple of weeks agothere was some reference in the news to a meeting between Verizon and Google.Presumably it relates to 700 megahertz option, maybe wireless broadband in thefuture. In general, how are you thinking about opportunities to partner, and interms of at Verizon and at Google, what could each party do you think bring tothe other?", "Denny Strigl", "First of all, as you would expect, we meet with lots ofcompanies and people all of the time, including companies like Google. Frankly,we don't have any other comments, and as you know, it is our policy not tocomment on rumors, or discussions that we may or may not have had. So I think Iwill leave it at that.", "David Janazzo  - Merrill Lynch", " Anything justgenerally on what you could bring to a company like that or what they couldbring to you?", "Denny Strigl", " I have no furthercomment on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Lehman Brothers.", "Tom Seitz  - Lehman Brothers", "When you look at what is going on in places like Rhode  Island where you have rolled out FiOS and you'reactually increasing access lines, are you tempted at all to push back thedilution estimates such that you can take advantage of a product that has gotreal momentum right now? I mean listening to the cable operators on theearnings call, their change in tone of perception about FiOS is remarkable.", "Secondly, can you update us as to where we are in gettingmargin improvement out of the system integration with MCI and the access linesavings from the CapEx spend this year? I mean not to get perfectly exact, butcan you give us a sense of perhaps maybe what inning we are at in terms ofrecognizing those improvements?", "Doreen Toben", "Denny went through some of this, but I would say as far asincreasing FiOS deployment, at the moment at least we are about going as fastas we think we can. We do have, as you mentioned, some urban markets that wehope to open up in the next 18 to 24 months. That will significantly expand ouropportunities. I would say that from a rollout perspective, we are not tryingto manage dilution based on the rollout. So if we wanted to roll out quicker,we would go ahead and do that.", "Denny Strigl", "I will comment on the synergy targets. For Verizon businessin 2007 we're planning about $900 million in synergies. That is up,incidentally, from an original target of $825 million. In the third quarter ofthis year, approximately $300 million in synergies.", "Doreen Toben", "Yes, and then I guess if you ask me what inning, I would saywe are probably with a three-year program so we have got one more year to go,and we think we will be where we need to be.", "Ron Lataille", " Operator, that willconclude our call for today.

(NYSE:VZ) Q1 2008 Earnings Call April 28, 2008  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President Investor Relations", "Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Doreen Toben - Chief Financial Officer", "", "Analysts", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Tom Sykes - Lehman Brothers", "David Barden - Banc of America", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 JP Morgan", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the Verizon first-quarter 2008 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. ", "A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I\u2019d like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the first quarter. ", "Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.57, adjusted earnings or EPS before the effects of special items was $0.61. We are excluding the following special items from adjusted results. The first is a charge of $18 million after tax or $0.01 per share for merger integration costs. We are also excluding an $81 million after tax charge or $0.03 per share for non operational costs incurred in connection with the spin off of access lines in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont. These costs are mostly related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company.", "As you know, we completed the spin off on March 31st. I would also note that our first quarter and prior period financials include the results of the Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont operations. Beginning with the second quarter these operations will no longer be part of Verizon. To help investors adjust prior period results for the exclusion of these northern New England operations we will post reclassified historical information on our IR website within a few weeks. These reclassifications will only affect revenues, expenses and operating income. Earnings will be the same as previously reported. We will also adjust the appropriate volume metrics.", "With that I will now turn the call over to Doreen.", "Doreen Toben", "Good morning everyone. Before I get into the details let me start with the comments about our results. Results for the first quarter were strong and demonstrate that we weathered the economic uncertainty. We turned in another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth with good margin expansion and double digit earnings growth. In fact, this is the fifth consecutive quarter of double digit growth in EPS from continuing operations.", "Our key growth areas; Wireless, FiOS, and Enterprise Strategic Services continue to drive results. Verizon Wireless had a very good quarter of customer and revenue growth. Our positive momentum in FiOS drove broadband and video revenues over $1 billion this quarter. Within Verizon Business, Strategic Services revenue growth once again was in the low to mid 20% range. Now let\u2019s get to some of the details.", "As you see on slide four we\u2019ve had continued revenue growth and steady margin expansion in each of the last five quarters. Consolidated revenues grew $1.2 billion or 5.5% in the first quarter. Although Wireless is still our number one growth engine our other growth drivers are also picking up scale and momentum. As I noted just a moment ago broadband and video services toped the $1 billion mark this quarter with nearly 50% growth and Verizon Business, Strategic Services revenues of $1.4 billion grew in excess of 23%. ", "While we sustained revenue growth in the mid single digits our operating margins have expanded each and every quarter. In the first quarter the operating income margin grew 140 basis points year over year to 18.7%. Our EBITDA margins also expanded 80 basis points year over year to 33.8%, bottom line our $0.61 of diluted EPS from continuing operations this quarter was up 13% year over year demonstrating our continued ability to translate top line growth into earnings improvement.", "Turning to slide five you can see our strong cash performance. In the first quarter cash flows from continuing operations grew 6.9% year over year to $5.4 billion. With our strong balance sheet and cash flows we\u2019ve continued to invest in our network and new technologies to provide the platform for growth, innovation, and productivity. Capital expenditures were flat year over year at $4.2 billion and our capital efficiency continues to improve due to our top line growth. This quarter CapEx to revenue dropped to 17.7% an improvement of 70 basis points from a year ago.", "Obviously the recent acquisition of 700 MHz spectrum was also a key strategic investment to strengthen our ability to capture the enormous growth potential we see for years to come in Wireless. We ended the first quarter with total debt of $35.8 billion and $5.5 billion of cash on our balance sheet. This cash, along with the $4 billion of capital raised through long term borrowings in April was recently used to pay for the FCC auction 73 wireless licenses that we won.", "While investing for growth is critical to value creation we are also focused on returning value to our share owners. To that end we\u2019ve continued pay a very competitive dividend and also repurchase shares. During the first quarter we were opportunistic taking advantage of market conditions to repurchase one billion of our common stock. We expect to continue repurchasing shares at a more normal rate but maintain the ability to increase buy backs if warranted by market conditions.", "Let\u2019s look now at our segment results beginning with Verizon Wireless on slide six. We continue to see strong customer growth particularly in our retail subscriber base. Total net adds were 1.5 million of which 1.3 million were retail post-paid. Retail post-paid customers comprise nearly 93% of our total base and clearly remain the primary focus of our business. Pre-paid is still approximately 4% of the base and we added 168,000 retail pre-paid customers this quarter which is about the same as first quarter last year. As you know, only 3% of our base is not retail.", "Reseller net adds were 20,000 in the quarter. Our growth add performance was also strong this quarter with retail growth adds up 6.5% and total growth adds up 4.4% year over year. Churn remains very low with total churn of 1.19% and retail post-paid churn of 0.93%. Both were seasonally down sequentially as expected.", "Turning to revenues we sustained our record of strong double digit growth, total revenues increased to $11.7 billion in the first quarter up 13.2% over last year. Service revenue topped the $10 million mark this quarter up 12.8% year over year and 2.7% sequentially. Retail service revenue grew 13.3% year over year as retail service ARPU increased by 1.3% to $51.40. About two thirds of the growth in total service revenue is from Wireless data.", "In the first quarter Wireless data revenue exceeded $2.3 billion up nearly 49% over last year. Retail data ARPU increased almost $3.00 year over year to $11.94. Data now represents 23% of total service revenue up from 17.5% a year ago. More than 48 million or about 74% of our retail customers had some form of data usage in the quarter and 58% of our retail base has a broadband capable devise up from 40% a year ago. As strong as these results are we see continued momentum and excellent future growth opportunities ahead in Wireless data.", "As we mentioned on our Spectrum Auction conference call a few weeks ago we believe we are in a unique position to tap into the exploding data market opportunity. The acquisition of 700 MHz licenses clearly enhanced our spectrum position and we achieved all of the objectives we had going into the auction. Our first goal was to obtain nationwide clear spectrum to maximize our growth potential. We also wanted to increase the depth and breadth of our footprint particularly as it related to future capacity in key markets.", "As a result of our success we increased our spectrum inventory by about 60%. Across the top markets we have a total average spectrum depth of about 85 MHz. With regard to our open development initiative we held our developers conference a little over a month ago in New York. The feedback has been great with lots of interest on the part of the developer community and no shortage of unique ideas and opportunities for innovation.", "To say the least the combination of our global broadband networks, our enhanced spectrum position, our 4G plans with LTE and the innovation that will come from our open development initiative makes us very bullish about our future growth opportunities. ", "In summary, our strong Wireless performance demonstrates once again our ability to execute in a very competitive environment. We are confident in our ability to sustain double digit revenue growth; our continued dominance in the retail post-paid market is strengthening our high quality customer base and helping to drive further increases in data usage and growth. Our focus on retention and operational efficiencies has resulted in industry leading profitability.", "This quarter was no exception; EBITDA grew 5.7% on a sequential basis and 14.3% year over year with margins expanding to 44.9%. As the industry leader, Verizon Wireless has a long list of first in terms of products and service innovations. Most importantly we\u2019ve made all of these firsts work to our benefit in terms of growth, retention and profitability. We\u2019re feeling very good about our position to capitalize on the enormous opportunities in Wireless data for years to come. To say the least, we are very upbeat about the prospects for Wireless growth in 2008 and beyond. ", "Turning now to Wireline, our strategic FiOS product continued their impressive growth. In the first quarter growth in FiOS TV customers accelerated to 263,000. That\u2019s a sequential increase of 16%. We now have more than 1.2 million FiOS TV customers which is 19% penetration. Over the past year we have added more than 850,000 customers. Total broadband subscribers, DSL plus FiOS internet increased to 8.5 million up 1.1 million or 15% from a year ago and we added 266,000 broadband customers in the quarter. In FiOS internet we have just over 1.8 million subscribers representing 23% penetration.", "Retail residential lines declined 622,000 in the quarter compared with 616,000 last quarter and 619,000 in the first quarter a year ago. We continue to see an increasing correlation between TV availability and line retention. At the end of the quarter we were able to offer video to 82% of the 7.9 million FiOS homes open for sale expanding our Triple Play availability. Earlier this month we filed our New York City application for a video franchise covering 3.1 million homes many of which are MDUs.", "We already passed about 20% of these premises with Fiber so the FiOS initiative is going very well and we are gaining scale and momentum. As we move into new markets we have a great opportunity to sustain and accelerate both customer and revenue growth. In addition, our capital unit costs are trending lower as we scale and we continue to be focused on productivity. We are clearly on track to attain our goal of at least 25% FiOS TV penetration and 35% to 40% FiOS internet penetration. The consumer retail business is increasingly centered on broadband, video and bundles. ", "Our high growth broadband and video revenues represented almost 25% of the $3.8 billion legacy consumer revenues this quarter and were up 56% year over year. Broadband and video have also driven consumer retail ARPU to $61.02 an increase of 9.6% year over year. The average FiOS ARPU of about $129 per month is more than double the overall consumer retail ARPU. Since not everyone has all three services the Triple Play ARPU is even higher. You may recall we increased prices for selected products in the first quarter last year. We anticipate increasing prices once again on certain products and bundles in the second quarter this year. ", "Now let\u2019s take a Verizon Business. In this market we continue to see strong demand for strategic services which are focused on IP and data growth opportunities. Total revenues of $5.2 billion grew 0.4% year over year. As we discussed at our last earnings call first quarter revenues were impacted by some customers moving traffic off of our network. These strategic take backs resulted in a loss of one percentage point of year over year growth. We believe that the first quarter will be the low point in the year for Verizon Business revenue growth and expect to see steady improvement as we work through this loss.", "On the top chart on slide 12 I\u2019ve displayed our global retail enterprise revenue which is clearly our primary strategic focus. Again, the growth rates in the last two quarters reflect the effects of the strategic take backs. Strategic services now represent about 27% of total Verizon Business revenue which grew 23.5% over first quarter last year driven by private IP, managed services and security. Along with the accelerating transition to IP we\u2019re seeing a growing trend on the part of global customers to outsource their managed and professional services. We are increasing our ultra long haul capabilities and expanding our global reach to meet this continued solid demand.", "In summary, we are seeing continued shift to data in both the consumer and business markets as well as ongoing secular changes particularly in consumer. Total data revenues now represent almost 40% of total Wireline revenues and data growth is accelerating up 14.8% this quarter compared with last year. We are well positioned to address these secular changes as evidenced by the growing demand for our key strategic products. ", "We expect the customer demand for FiOS to continue as well as demand for a strategic services in the enterprise space as more customers transition to IP and look to companies like ours to manage their networks and provide data security. Similar to prior years we made investments in marketing and productivity improvement initiatives early in the year. These investments along with a full effect of the telecom pricing increases and revenue improvement in enterprise will help drive revenue growth and year over year margin expansion.", "We have significant opportunities to reduce costs, for example we expect operational improvements in FiOS to continue and we are very much on track to meet our goal of becoming EBITDA positive this year. As far as forced reductions are concerned we have steadily reduced Wireline headcount over the past several years. In 2007 we reduced our Wireline workforce by about 6,500 people. We expect this trend to continue with ongoing reductions planned throughout the year.", "We are constantly focused on reducing our access costs and we continue to work hard in the systems integration area. Overall we believe that about half of our Wireline cost structure is variable which gives us confidence in our long term outlook for Wireline margins. We remain committed to increasing Wireline EBITDA margins to the 30% to 33% range during the planning period.", "To wrap up our growth strategy once again drove strong results in the first quarter. We have built positive momentum in all key growth areas. Our network capabilities and the strength of our products and services position us well to continue driving growth and margin expansion. At the same time we have operational initiatives in place to reduce costs. We believe that our strong cash flows will enable us to continue investing for growth and improved productivity for years to come. ", "Our balance sheet is strong, we remain committed to increasing share on returns through competitive dividends and share repurchases. We are fully confident of our ability to grow the business, deliver strong operating results, and create solid long term share on returns. In short, we expect 2008 will be another year of strong operating and financial performance and with that I\u2019ll turn it back to Ron.", "Ron Lataille", "Operator, Doreen and Denny are now available to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "A couple questions on Wireline margins. They came in a little bit lighter than we expected and I heard the comments on sticking to the 30% to 33% over the planning period. Can you give us an idea of how you expect the margins to trend for the quarter, is this the low point in the quarter then you go up from here or is it going to bounce around here for the next couple quarters? How that relates to what we saw in \u201907, should it be sort of flattish versus \u201907 or up versus \u201907? You talked a little bit about some investments, some marketing and productivity; can you give us a little more color on what some of the spending was about here in the first quarter?", "Denny Strigl", "Let me begin this one. Yes, first quarter margin was flat year over year. If you look back at the last couple of years the first quarter margins are typically lower than the third and fourth quarters and the full year average. For us, this year was no different and it\u2019s what we had expected. Although there are always some puts and takes every quarter there were no changes in the key drivers, those being FiOS, EBITDA showed good improvement, definitely some secular shifts in the core but no significant change in trend.", "There are some timing issues that affected revenues and margins for example in consumer the first quarter last year included $70 to $80 million of price increases. We decided to implement those price increases or similar price increases in the second quarter of this year. Also, in enterprise, Doreen and I have mentioned this before, we had some, what we call strategic take backs. They are actually some large accounts that were lost either before or just after our MCI merger. ", "It has taken some time for those accounts to, the revenue actually to diminish. However, we are at a high point on that now. We will see that again in the second quarter of this year and then we\u2019ll work through it. What\u2019s the outlook? Our outlook for Wireline margins hasn\u2019t changed as Doreen mentioned on her formal remarks we\u2019re committed to increasing Wireline EBITDA margins to 30% to 33% range and my operating plan this year targets 80 to 100 basis point improvement in margins. Frankly it what Ivan and I are paying our executive team to do. I\u2019m targeting margins to move from the mid 27% run rate to the low 28% range.", "Doreen Toben", "On productivity, mostly I would call it blocking and tackling, it\u2019s a lot of systems work. We are really focused on reducing average handling time in the centers we\u2019ve been working on order simplification, the multi-sessions for the reps, billing simplification. We are also doing a lot on more self service trying to get more click to chat which drives our costs down. We are trying to put some things for national screening to avoid misdirected calls. I would call it a lot of blocking and tackling. On the marketing side just a lot more media spends, some of it being the TV in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Sykes of Lehman Brothers.", "Tom Sykes - Lehman Brothers", "Obviously a lot of angst, when the unlimited plans were announced earlier this year. Can you share with us what you are seeing in terms of current customers moving down and up as well as anything you are seeing with respect to new customers in this category? In a related vein, can you talk to us about what data take rates are with these unlimited plans?", "Denny Strigl", "I will take that question. The status of the unlimited plan is as follows; we don\u2019t typically comment on pricing results but given the controversy of the unlimited plans I\u2019d like to try to put this to rest. We\u2019re pleased with the results of our $99 unlimited plan. We\u2019re seeing good growth in high tier voice plans. We\u2019ve seen churn benefits and data growth and let me give you some specifics. Nearly 90% of our unlimited plan gross adds are single lines. ", "In the first quarter our unlimited plan accounted for 13% of our single line retail post-paid adds. That compares to about 4% choosing the $99 or above tiers before the plan was launched. Additionally, a high percentage of the new customers who choose an unlimited plan also choose our select or premium data packages. From a churn perspective in March which was the first full month after the launch our average daily disconnects declined 6% from previous months and that is at the voice access tier $79 and above. As expected our churn improved in the high tiers as well. At this point we\u2019re very happy with the way this plan is moving in the market for us.", "Tom Sykes - Lehman Brothers", "Even with some customers moving down this basically was accretive in the first quarter it was rolled out, is that correct?", "Danny Strigl", "Remember there\u2019s only one month in the first quarter. It was in the first month as far as we can see, very good for us and accretive, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Banc of America.", "David Barden - Banc of America", "On the flip side of the Wireline margin equation you guys were at the top end of your 43% to 45% margin expectation for the quarter. If one wanted to look at it on the positive side one would say that you guys are taking great market share even at the high end of your margin band and you might go north from here. On the other side you might say that this is the low watermark for Wireline margins and that as Wireline margins drift up you might decide to bring the Wireline margins back down to take share over the balance of the year. I\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on that.", "As a second question, to tie off the year over year comparisons I remember last year changes in deprecation methodologies and things were an issue and how they affected earnings in the quarter. Could you address what, if any changes this quarter took place?", "Doreen Toben", "You\u2019ve flipped between Wireless and Wireline, are you asking both?", "David Barden - Banc of America", "More about whether the objective with Wireline margins is either to balance off Wireline margins and as Wireline margins go up we should expect Wireless margins to come down or given that you\u2019re at the high end of your Wireless margin guidance and you\u2019re taking the highest market share in the market are you comfortable now at the higher end of these levels and maybe even going north from here?", "Doreen Toben", "First of all, no, we\u2019re not balancing off Wireless margins to Wireline margins; we don\u2019t do that at all. The first part of the question was no. I think we stay with our 43% to 45% guidance on Wireless margins. I\u2019m not going to go different than we\u2019ve given you on traditional metrics. What else was in that question was there anything else?", "David Barden - Banc of America", "That was the crux of that question. The second part was on the depreciation year over year.", "Doreen Toben", "On the depreciation we had a very small move in depreciation and we disclosed that in the K. No, there are really not many changes. If you look at our deprecation in aggregate in total you\u2019re not going to see much difference year over year when you go to the Verizon level so not much of a change.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "I wonder if you could drill down into broadband for us a little bit. We obviously saw continued strong FiOS results but DSL continues to soften. Maybe you can update us on the number of FiOS customers that are taking DSL now and some of your moves to upgrade the speed that side of the FiOS footprint. What do you think is driving the year over year declines, is it really an issue of saturation or market share or are we seeing some economy there as well?", "Denny Strigl", "Here\u2019s what I\u2019ll say about that. First DSL growth adds as you may have seen here are up sequentially this quarter 6%. Migrations to FiOS internet were up 100 basis points to 23%. Business migrations were up about 400 basis points. Excluding FiOS migrations churn has not changed. We expect this dynamic to continue. We\u2019re boosting DSL speeds, to your question to seven meg is some areas and we\u2019re also doing some additional marketing. ", "This is designed to help the gross adds but also we feel you can expect continued migrations to FiOS internet and migrations actually we think could accelerate. What\u2019s important is the total broadband remains strong. This quarter FiOS internet subs were up by one million year over year and DSL up about 170,000.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "No real impact from bad debts on the economy or anything like that?", "Doreen Toben", "No, we\u2019re taking a look, as you know I look at daily, weekly, and monthly metrics as far as uncollectible we\u2019re not really seeing it at all. No change in trends there at all or in lines so no from the DSL and uncollectible not at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Janazzo of Merrill Lynch.", "David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch", "Last quarter following up on the economy, last quarter you had ticked off a number of metrics that you were monitoring across the business, can you give us an update on that?", "Doreen Toben", "No, I still look at all of those metrics even more if I can get a hold of them. We are really not seeing changes in trend. Actually if you look at Wireline the uncollectible number is actually down year over year so it\u2019s much improved. Wireless has certainly stabilized. If I look at access line trends around the country trends have remained the same. As I look at all that it\u2019s the same. I would also point you to, if you look at our volume metrics, we had very strong Wireless net adds, the FiOS net adds were really strong. ", "Verizon Business funnel remains strong, ARPU was up both in consumer and Wireline and Wireless data revenues were up, the broadband video increased. Right now, although I\u2019m continuing to monitor, but as I\u2019m looking at this I\u2019m really not seeing any change in trends and no concerns at this time.", "David Janazzo - Merrill Lynch", "You had mentioned a correlation between FiOS and access line losses and I\u2019ve heard you give statistics on that before, can you give us an update, the latest thinking on that?", "Doreen Toben", "It continues to get stronger and stronger. I\u2019ve mentioned a couple times that I look at those essential offices or areas in every single one of the states where we have FiOS video for over six months. There is an incredible correlation at a minimum of 250 basis points many areas much higher 500, 700, 1,000 basis points. In those areas that have both data and video over six months, the correlation continues very strong.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup", "I was wondering if you could talk about how diluted FiOS is to the EBITDA and EBITDA margin currently and what are your plans to break even on that basis?", "Doreen Toben", "Right now I would say that it\u2019s really on tract to the EBITDA positive so we feel really good about the numbers. We feel really good about all the capital and expense metrics that we\u2019re seeing capital is probably better than I expected all the expense metrics on hours and what not actually better than planned. At this point FiOS is really not diluting on a sequential basis the EBITDA so you\u2019re not seeing, that is not a cause of the sequential decline at all. Expect it to be positive by the end of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Bear Stearns.", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "A couple things, first on the Verizon Business side can you guys give us an update on where you stand on the margin improvement opportunity there and also maybe just comment on the competitive dynamic? Secondly, you mentioned that there\u2019s a possibility for pricing increases in 2Q on FiOS product. Can you give us a sense for how you guys feel comfortable doing that as far as the competitive dynamics whether it\u2019s the cable pricing or demand on your side?", "Denny Strigl", "Let me begin this question. Overall for Verizon Business feeling very good about the competitive strengths we have in the marketplace. Unsurpassed global network capability, some solid sales and service teams in place with global reach and scale. Broad product portfolio led by IP capabilities both MPLS private line IP, security services and Ethernet portfolio and coverage. I think we\u2019re in very, very good shape against the competition. Maybe what\u2019s selling for us. ", "We\u2019re seeing increased opportunities with large complex deals as more enterprises look to outsource and consolidate to one vendor. We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised over the last couple of quarters in that regard. We\u2019re also selling IP network services and that\u2019s actually driven by growing data communications requirements, security services let by cyber trust offerings going well for us. Managed service for LAN, WAN and other devices looking good for us.", "One of the questions you all have asked us in the past concerns competitive pricing pressures and the market continues to be competitive but we think Verizon has benefited from consolidation and weakness in some of the other competitors. Pricing will always be competitive but we continue to focus on value. The write down activity has been stable and first quarter \u201908 pretty much in line with first quarter of \u201907.", "Doreen Toben", "On the margin side for Verizon Business we\u2019ve made great progress so that\u2019s been on plan. I would point to one thing and I think you\u2019ve heard us talk to it before. The fact the large strategic revenues that we lost from one or two particular customers actually had very good margins. That was part of the sequential decline in margins was really driven out of a particular contract or two from that standpoint. What was your FiOS question was it on pricing?", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "The price increase, how you\u2019re comfortable doing that, whether or not the cable pricing is that wide of a disparity and just thoughts generally.", "Doreen Toben", "Yes, I think you\u2019ll see us move up pricing probably end of this quarter, early next quarter. Obviously we think it\u2019s a superior product, we think we\u2019ve had great sales, we\u2019re very comfortable moving up the pricing at this point.", "Mike McCormack - Bear Stearns", "Are you seeing a disparity between the competitive pricing of where you guys are?", "Doreen Toben", "No, I think that we\u2019re actually pretty close. Everybody still has that $99 bundle. Then there\u2019s a little bit of a tax issue with us. I did disclose in the script sort of for the first time the $129 ARPU which I think is not the Triple Play, that\u2019s the average which if you were to assume that\u2019s an average not everybody has the Triple Play that is the ARPU for the Triple Play of course is much higher than that. I think that\u2019s a pretty impressive number as I at least look at the competitors.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Two clarifications and then a follow up. Is this take rate a pretty good run rate do you think, I might have missed this in your commentary and then maybe an update on where you are with your FiOS penetration in your most mature markets at this point?", "Doreen Toben", "On the tax rate actually we had given guidance of 35% to 37% I would probably tell you I might move that guidance down to 35% to 36%. I am actually looking, there are some issues that are under tax investigation and so we may have something settled next quarter which will in fact bring the rate lower for the second quarter. I would use a 35% to 36% as opposed to the 35% to 37%. On the penetration question you had as far as FiOS was what?", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "In your most mature markets the ones you\u2019ve been in for more than two years where you are at now?", "Doreen Toben", "I guess in TV I would say we\u2019re certainly well over 25, we\u2019ve got some with a four in front of it then we\u2019ve got several with threes in front of it so very strong. I would say on internet I think almost everybody has at least a two in front of it and many of them have a three in front of it. I would say some in the 40s which is at the high end then mostly in the 20s.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "In your comments you said in five quarters of double digit earnings growth and you\u2019re not seeing big impact yet from the economy. Any reason that can\u2019t continue, if I\u2019m looking at the trends here in Wireless it does seem like the margins continue to expand there and you talk about Wireline margins expanding. The tax rate being stable, depreciation being stable, doing stock buy backs, it looks like the double digit can continue for a while maybe absent the economy really slowing.", "Doreen Toben", "We don\u2019t give quarter specific guidance. We\u2019ve certainly given business plan guidance so over the plan we\u2019re certainly comfortable with double digits. I don\u2019t disagree with certainly Wireless continues to go well, Wireline, Denny gave you some guidance as to where we think it will go. I\u2019m not going to give you specific quarterly guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Larsen of Credit Suisse.", "Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "The first is just a clarification, on the price increases on the FiOS side is that an indication you\u2019re going to increase the $99 bundle or are those components in there? Secondly, you had the incremental margin pressure in this first quarter some of it came from the FiOS TV offer where you got the free TV, can you give us a quantification of maybe what we might see trend back? There was some talk of constraints in whether the installers or A/C boxes can you give us an update on where you are there and how you are doing on installations of FiOS?", "Doreen Toben", "On the price increases I think we will keep the $99 price. What we are doing is whether it\u2019s set top boxes or its premium channels or miscellaneous so I think the $99 bundle will stay because that\u2019s where everybody else is so you\u2019ll see in different spots there. As far as giving you a specific number on the TVs I won\u2019t do that. I will tell you that marketing expenses will probably trend somewhat down from where they were in the first quarter.", "Denny Strigl", "We\u2019re pretty much caught up on the HD boxes; the production is in good shape at this point. There are still some that we are replacing that had been in the field and sold early on, pretty much through the problem all together.", "Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "If I could ask one more, there\u2019s some talk that you could capitalize the interest expense in the spectrum have you made a final determination on that? If you do decide to capitalize it how long can you capitalize it, is it until you deploy the 700 MHz spectrum?", "Doreen Toben", "The answer is yes, you would capitalize it until you deploy it. At current course and speed I anticipate that we will capitalize most of it. However, I\u2019m not going to get out in front of my accountants in that we need E&Y and Deloitte to both sign off on the plan that we put together. Until that that\u2019s really signed off by them other than the intent is to capitalize most of it. When I get that all done I\u2019ll let you know. You should think about it that way.", "Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "That would be amortized over the 40 year period of the spectrum?", "Doreen Toben", "I guess I\u2019m not going to go through that until I get the final from the accountants.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "First regarding the recent access line sale in northern New England lost of nuances you saw there at the public utility commission level. I\u2019m just wondering as you look forward does this change the appetite at all for further access line sales in your base. Second, in Wireless talking about LTE here can you give us any granularity around the cost to roll that out?", "Denny Strigl", "Let me start with the access line piece and we\u2019re very pleased that we finally got into conclusion in New England with FairPoint. We think overall a good deal for both parties relative to looking at other access lines. I think it\u2019s important to say we always look at possibilities but nothing planned at the present.", "Doreen Toben", "LTE as far as looking at the planning period it\u2019s really less than EVDO was so this is not something that we see as a big increase of the capital budget.", "Operator", "Jonathan Chaplin of JP Morgan", "Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 JP Morgan", "A quick follow up on the Wireline margins, I\u2019m wondering if any of the normalizing items that you took in the quarter for Puerto Rico and for merger related expenses would have been captured in Wireline. If so, it seems like most of them probably were attributable to Wireline actually, in which case the margins would have been more, I think in the 28% range. Just looking at the sequential pressure, I understand that the large enterprise contracts or wholesale contracts, the move to where there are very high margin revenues, is there anything else besides the enterprise contracts would have accounted for the margin pressure, or is that just about all of it?", "Doreen Toben", "First of all, no, there is no PRTC or Dominican or anything in the Wireline margins, so Wireline is Wireline. I guess if you were to take, I'm not sure how helpful this is, if you were to take out some of the M&A normalization out of the Qs, you would see less of a sequential decline from fourth quarter to first quarter, if that was sort of your question. Then I think a lot of it I really talked about in the prepared remarks, which was we have got some marketing costs that were very heavy in the first quarter. You know some other mostly marketing in some of the Verizon Business contracts that were the first quarter pressure.", "Ron Lataille", "Operator, that\u2019s our last question for the day and I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us and we\u2019ll see you again next quarter.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NYSE:VZ) Q2 2008 Earnings Call July 28, 2008  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "", "Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Doreen Toben - Chief Financial Officer", "Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Analysts", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup", "David Barden - Banc of America Securities", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Michael McCormack - J.P. Morgan", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Christopher Larsen - Credit Suisse", "Operator", "", "Welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2008 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "", "I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we get started let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. ", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "As you know, we completed the spin off of access lines to FairPoint at the end of the first quarter, so our second quarter results do not include these properties. For purposes of comparability we have made available reclassified historical information on our website. These reclassifications affected revenues, expenses and operating income. Prior period earnings are unaffected by these reclassifications. We have also adjusted the appropriate volume metrics, so all the growth rates and prior period information presented in our earnings materials are on a comparable basis. ", "Before turning the call over to Doreen for a review of our results, I'd like to cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the second quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.66. Adjusted earnings per share, before the effects of special items were $0.67. The only special item we excluded from adjusted results this quarter is a charge of $22 million after-tax or $0.01 per share for MCI merger integration costs. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Doreen.", "Doreen Toben", "", "The good momentum in our key strategic areas allowed us to turn in another quarter of mid-single digit revenue growth, continued margin expansion, and double-digit earnings growth. So from a financial perspective, we met our key performance metrics.", "Verizon Wireless had a very strong quarter, with revenue growth of nearly 12%, 1.5 million retail net adds, record low churn, and an EBITDA margin of over 45%. Continued penetration of FiOS drove broadband and video revenues to $1.2\u00a0billion this quarter, and with Verizon Business, strategic service revenues grew about 19%.", "In terms of profitability, operating income margins increased to 19% and our EBITDA margins grew to 33.9%. Margin expansion is being driven by Wireless as well as improving FiOS efficiencies. ", "Our $0.67 of diluted EPS from continuing operations this quarter was up 15.5% year-over-year. ", "We also had another strong quarter of cash generation. With steady capital spending and revenues continuing to grow, our capital efficiency has improved, a trend we expect will continue. Clearly, our network investments, together with the strength of our products and services, are enabling growth at both the top and bottom lines. ", "Now let's cover some of the details.", "As you can see on Slide 4, over the past year we've been able to sustain strong earnings performance through consolidated revenue growth and steady margin expansion. This quarter was no exception. ", "Our top line grew $1.1\u00a0billion or 4.9% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Sequentially, quarterly revenues increased $549\u00a0million or 2.3%. ", "Operating income grew over $450 million or 10.9% year-over-year, and the margin increased 100\u00a0basis points. ", "Our second quarter EBITDA margin expanded 70 basis points year-over-year to 33.9%. ", "Continued mid-single digit revenue growth and steady margin expansion resulted in $0.67 EPS this quarter. ", "On the next slide you can see our strong cash generation profile. For the first half of this year cash flow from continuing operations was about $12.1 billion, up 4.2% compared with last year. We believe very strongly that our disciplined investment in networks and new technologies will continue to provide the platform for growth, innovation and productivity. ", "Our revenue growth and slightly lower capital spending is improving the capital intensity of the business. For the first half of the year, total Capex was $8.4 billion, which is around $100 million less than we spent at this time last year. Our Capex to revenue for the first half was 17.6%, an improvement of 120 basis points compared with a year ago. ", "Our higher debt balance is from borrowings relating to the purchase of the 700 megahertz spectrum and the upfront purchase of bridge debt in the pending Alltel acquisition. These two strategic investments strengthen our overall growth outlook and provide the opportunity to further expand our wireless market leadership.", "We have made the determination to capitalize the interest on the wireless licenses while they are being readied for commercial use. As a result, we incurred no incremental interest expense in the quarter related to these borrowings.", "Now let's look at our segment results, beginning with Verizon Wireless on Slide 6.", "We had another strong quarter of customer growth, particularly in the retail market. Total net adds for the second quarter were 1.5 million, essentially all of which were retail post-paid. We now have 68.7 million total customers, which are largely retail. We only have 2 million reseller customers in our base, and our 66.7 million retail customers are largely post-paid, about 2.9 million or 4% are prepaid. ", "Gross add performance was very strong again this quarter, with retail growth adds up 3.2% and nearly 5% for the first half compared with last year. Our industry leading churn rates were a record low this quarter, with total churn of 1.12% and retail post-paid churn of 0.83%, which improvements both sequentially and year-over-year. ", "Clearly, we are gaining share. Throughout last year we took between 50% and 55% of retail post-paid net adds among the top four carriers. In the first quarter, we took 78%. Since only two of us have reported so far, we don't know what the percentage will be this quarter, but we believe this will be a very impressive number once again. ", "Turning to revenues, we had another strong performance sustaining double-digit growth. Service revenue grew to $10.5 billion this quarter, up 11.6% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. Total service ARPU increased 0.9% to $51.53. ", "More than 70% of the growth in total service revenue is from wireless data, and data now represents 24.4% of total service revenue. The drivers of growth are broadband access, e-mail and messaging. Data revenues in the quarter grew 45% year-over-year and nearly 10% sequentially. Data ARPU was up 31% over last year. About 60% of this growth is from non-messaging services. Mobile broadband access through PC cards and e-mail through integrated devices and PDAs are experiencing very high growth. There is plenty of upside here, particularly as we penetrate the small and medium businesses and enterprise markets. Roughly 60% of our retail base currently has a broadband capable device. ", "In the near term, the introduction of new devices and new applications, like our push-to-talk product, will drive revenue growth. ", "Next year, our Rural Cellular and Alltel acquisitions will provide further opportunities for growth. Later this year you will be hearing more about some new converged service applications and product integrations between wireless and our FiOS platform that will be very much differentiated in the marketplace as well as some managed mobility solutions for global enterprise customers. Beyond that, our enhance spectrum position, our 4G plans with LTE, and the innovation that will be fostered by our open development initiative will provide excellent future growth opportunities in the area of wireless data. ", "In summary, our strong Wireless performance demonstrates our ability to execute in a very competitive environment. Our sharp focus on retention and further improving operational efficiency has resulted in industry leading profitability and is generating substantial cash flow. ", "EBITDA grew 5.1% on a sequential basis and 11.3% yearover-year with a very strong 45.6% EBITDA margin on service revenue this quarter. ", "Our capital spending totaled around $3.3 billion for the first half of the year, which is about 4% less than last year at this time. Our Capex to revenue ratio for the first half was 13.7%, an improvement of 230 basis points from a year ago. ", "So our Wireless strategy and outlook are unchanged. Our primary focus is on maintaining double-digit revenue growth and strong cash generation, and we will continue to prudently strive for growth while maintaining productivity within our stated range of 43% to 45% EBITDA margins.", "Let's next move to Wireline, starting with customer growth in the consumer and small business markets. ", "In terms of secular and competitive challenges, there is really nothing new here. We continue to see access line losses at roughly the same levels. FiOS is demonstrating continued strength in the marketplace, and we've achieved very good penetration in a relatively short period of time. ", "In addition we have a substantial growth opportunity as we launch FiOS TV service in New York City today. At the end of the quarter our FiOS TV customer base was 1.4 million, which is 20% penetration. During the quarter we added 176,000 net new customers. More than half of our markets are above 20% penetration. ", "In FiOS Internet we ended the quarter with 2 million customers, representing 24% penetration. About half of our markets are above 25% penetration and a [skewer] north of 30%. ", "DSL was a net negative 133,000 customers this quarter. Total broadband subscribers, that is, DSL plus FiOS Internet, now stand at 8.3 million, which is up 11.5% from a year ago. ", "Although the broadband market is maturing, it is clear that demand for higher speeds and more bandwidth is increasing, which supports our FiOS strategy. We are seeing evidence of this today, whether it's customers opting for higher-speed DSL or a DSL customer migrating to FiOS, or even a FiOS customer opting for higher speeds. We now offer 50 megabytes down and 20 megabytes up through our entire FiOS footprint. No other company can match these upstream speeds.", "The sequential decline in FiOS net adds was due primarily to a lower level of promotions, marketing and advertising activities during the quarter. For example, we ended our free TV offer. We expect promotional activity to increase in the third quarter, in part to support our New York City video launch.", "Our New York City video franchise covers 3 million premises throughout all five boroughs, about 2 million of which are in multi-dwelling units or MDUs. To date we've already passed about 25%, with a target to pass around 30% or about 900,000 premises by the end of 2008. In Staten Island, where we already offer FiOS Internet in many locations, our goal is to pass 98% with video by year end. And in Manhattan our goal is to pass 57% with video by the end of this year. Effective today there will be about 300,000 video homes open for sale with a year end target of 500,000. ", "I'm also very excited to announce that effective today we are now offering 100 high definition channels in the New York City and Northern New Jersey areas. This is clearly a significant higher number of HD channels than cable competitors currently offer. It also highlights the additional value we offer FiOS customers and further differentiates that FiOS platform. ", "Now with more than 11 million homes currently passed by FiOS, we are clearly gaining scale and momentum. To put this in perspective, a little more than 20% of our entire landline footprint can get the triple play today. Our triple play coverage will grow to at least 60% of our total homes, strengthening our ability to retain customers. As these customers increase their spending with us, it will not only help revenue metrics but also our cash flow.", "With regard to access lines, our quarterly losses continue to track within a range. During the second quarter total switch line losses were 920,000. There is usually a seasonal increase in disconnects in the second quarter, so I'd say we haven't seen any substantial changes in trend.", "From a consumer revenue perspective, broadband and video are clearly the growth drivers, topping the $1\u00a0billion mark in the second quarter. Broadband and video revenues now represent 28% of legacy consumer revenues this quarter and were up 53% year-over-year. Revenues from these services are also driving consistent growth in consumer retail ARPU, which is now nearly $64, up 10.4% from a year ago. ", "The continued deployment of FiOS and increased penetration of available homes will drive further growth in revenue and ARPU, especially as we increase triple play availability, which now stands at 84% of FiOS Internet homes open for sale. The blended FiOS ARPU is slightly over $130 per month. And since not everyone has all three services, the FiOS triple play is even higher.", "Now let's take a look at Verizon Business. In this market we continue to see solid demand and our sales funnel remains strong. We have seen some pricing stability in certain products, but it obviously remains a very competitive market. ", "The top chart on Slide 11 displays our global retail enterprise revenue, which is our primary strategic focus. Second quarter revenues were up 1.7%. ", "As we've discussed before, recent quarter growth rates have been negatively affected by strategic takebacks, with certain customers moving traffic off our network. Excluding this effect in the second quarter, global retail enterprise growth would have been over 3%. ", "We expect second half revenue growth rates will improve, especially in the fourth quarter, as we have some significant contract wins that will begin revenue contributions later this year. ", "Total revenues of $5.3\u00a0billion for Verizon Business grew 0.9% year-over-year. ", "Strategic services now represent 28% of total Verizon Business revenue. Revenue associated with these services, mainly private IP, managed services and security, grew about 19% year-over-year. ", "In summary, we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively based on the positive momentum and demand for our key strategic products. Wireline EBITDA margin was 27.3%, which is up 60 basis points year-over-year and 30 basis points sequentially. As for top line growth, we expect the customer demand for FiOS to continue, and we certainly have a great near-term opportunity ahead of us in the New York City market. We are also making progress in our discussions with some other large cities.", "Also, we expect our strategic services in the enterprise space to continue growing as more businesses transition to IP and look to companies like ours to manage their networks and provide data security.", "In addition to these revenue growth opportunities, we also have significant opportunities to reduce costs. We remain committed to further margin expansion, and we are targeting improvements during the second half of this year. ", "We expect operational improvements in FiOS to continue. Our capital unit costs are trending lower as we scale, and we continue to be focused on productivity. We have made steady progress in reducing the costs of provisioning FiOS. ", "In addition to other areas, like system consolidation and access cost reductions, we've got a number of cost reduction opportunities we are pursuing, many of which involve our centralized network, IT, marketing and service organizations. ", "Broadly speaking, we have programs to eliminate costs through network simplification. We are looking at work center consolidation, [forcing] savings in fleet and energy management programs. We've got quite a few automation and self-service programs under way to reduce average handling times and increase use of the web and automated voice services. A lot of activity, but more to do.", "In summary, we are on track to meet our financial objectives, and we delivered a solid quarter. Our strategies are intact, and our long-term outlook is unchanged, with opportunities for continued revenue growth and steady margin improvement and the ability to generate cash and deliver double-digit earnings growth over the planning period. ", "As far as pending transactions are concerned, we believe that the closing of the Rural Cellular acquisition is imminent. The Alltel approval process is well under way, and we remain optimistic that it will close by year end. ", "In terms of our outlook for the second half of the year we see our positive momentum continuing, and we don't expect any significant economic impacts. We may begin to see some softening volumes, especially in the financial sector, but we do not expect this to significantly affect our business plan. We expect consolidated results to post solid mid-single digit revenue growth, steadily increasing margins, strong cash generation, and meet earnings growth expectations. ", "As far as capital spending is concerned, we are confident that we will be below our 2007 amount of $17.5\u00a0billion, with both Wireline and Wireless being less than last year, and this includes an estimated $200\u00a0million in capital related to the Rural Cellular integration. ", "Our strong cash outlook gives us the ability to continue investing for growth, and we are comfortable in considering a dividend increase with our Board in the fall. ", "And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Ron.", "Ron Lataille", "", "We're now ready for questions.", "Questions-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", " (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik - UBS.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "", "The FiOS video numbers were a little lower than expectations. Can you give us a sense of how you expect that to trend in the second half and maybe '09 versus '08, given the new promotions and new markets you guys are opening up? And maybe some detail on the slowdown, you know, in terms of penetration of new markets or whether you're seeing slowdown really more in mature markets?", "And then related to that, do you expect the new promotions in the third quarter to have any impact or noticeable impact on the margins?", "Denny Strigl", "", "First, so FiOS net adds in the second quarter were actually about what we had expected coming off of the very good first quarter, which was that free high-def TV. We expect third quarter net adds to increase and sales, even so far in early June, are trending higher. We continue to expand homes passed and open for sale, and we think we have the opportunity to improve net adds also with our New York City launch which occurred this morning.  ", "There will also be increased marketing around the New York City launch, and we're now offering 100\u00a0HD channels on our FiOS TV service, as you heard in Doreen's comments. So this will be more high definition, incidentally, than our cable competition, so we're expecting an upturn on our FiOS numbers in the third quarter.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "And any impact on the margins from the increased activity, Doreen, or do you expect to continue to see sequential improvement?", "Doreen Toben", "No, John, I would say that we will continue to see improvement in the second half of the year, you know, consistent to what we've said. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup", "", "Just a follow up with two quick questions. Just one on the Wireline margin front, you talked about the 80 to 100 bips guidance beforehand for the full year margin improvement, and I was wondering, you know, following the second quarter where we are along that track and if you see some increment - you've mentioned some items, but if you see any incremental items really being the key factors to delivering that margin expansion?", "And then just secondly, on the consumer business, what are you seeing in terms of where the incremental line loss is going? Do you feel it's going more wireless? Do you feel it's going more to cable or VoIP? And just any thoughts on how that should move over the next sort of 12 to 18 months. Is it going to be steady? Do you think there'll be more competition or less? ", "Denny Strigl", "Okay, Mike, I'll start this and ask Doreen to add her thoughts. But we have not changed our margin targets. Both Doreen and I remain convinced that we can improve Wireline margins and that our long-term goal of - you've heard us say this before - 30% to 33% is very achievable. So the organization is focused on driving both top line and bottom line improvement, and we should be on a run rate of at least 28% in the fourth quarter of this year.", "So, Doreen, anything to add?", "Doreen Toben", "I think on the [margin,] the only thing I'd say is, you know, obviously there's puts and takes that will affect it in the short term. We'll see where the volumes are for the third and fourth quarter. Also obviously the contract. I'll have to see if there's anything major of different than I was expecting coming out of the contract. But having said all that, you know, I continue to be very comfortable with double-digit earnings growth for the year. ", "And I would, you know, we have always said I am very comfortable. There's lots more cost-saving opportunities that come. So we're comfortable with the revenues, see that there are more cost savings that we can come in, and the 30% to 33%, you know, target has not changed at all. ", "Denny Strigl", "So Mike, on the line loss question that you asked, first of all, I don't see that this will spike further. I mean, you know, we work very hard to try to contain this. It is higher than what we had been geared for, but the fact of the matter is that it is very stiff competition that we're receiving from cable and also there is a wireless impact. It is our estimate that we see probably half of our line loss going to wireless service. But then at the same time I think it's important to say going forward we will continue to focus on growing our FiOS areas out as we do, and we continue to offer triple play packages, as Doreen had indicated in her comments. We have great success in competing with the cable companies. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America Securities.", "David Barden - Banc of America Securities", "", "First just on the Wireless, obviously no complaints about performance there, but ARPU was a little bit lighter than we were looking for. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about puts and takes. We know Sprint's out there being very aggressive on, you know, giving away free months of service and such trying to hold onto their customer base. There's obviously been a ramp up, presumably, in some of the $100 unlimited plan take rates. I wonder if you could kind of talk about the trend in those variables?", "And then the second question if I could, just, Denny and Doreen, on your commentary, is that all kind of assuming that the union relationship kind of continues as it is currently, or, you know, what kind of costs could conceivably be incurred if contingency plans have to be put in place later in the quarter?", "Denny Strigl", "Well, David, on the wireless ARPU, our total ARPU this quarter was up, as you saw, $0.48 year-over-year, up $0.62 from the first quarter. And, by the way, our data ARPU this quarter was up $3.00 year-over-year and that's up $0.86 sequentially. So these are good numbers, and we're still trending higher. In fact, we've had nine consecutive quarters of year-over-year ARPU growth.", "So, as you know, our business model is focused on our post-paid market, which has better characteristics than high reseller and prepaid business models. We've had some good wins, incidentally, in the business market this quarter. And when that occurs on the business side, somewhat like the family share plans, we see somewhat lower ARPU initially but then there's more data upside from broadband and e-mail opportunities that we see over time on those business accounts. And, of course, the whole business opportunity that we've realized helps us drive our churn levels even lower.", "So I guess going forward - and you've heard us say this before - I would ask us to think in broader terms, our ARPU being just one measure. I think we need to balance the ARPU with our leading churn rates, with EBITDA growth and overall with the quality of our customer base. We're quite pleased with the ARPU growth that we've had in the quarter.", "Doreen Toben", "And I guess, David, you know, they're in the middle of negotiations, so I don't think it's, you know, appropriate to comment on this very much, but obviously you've got salary and wage, you've got pension [bands], and you've got OPEB as big swings, and countless other things.", "David Barden - Banc of America Securities", "Doreen, more on that, on the financial impact.", "Denny Strigl", "I'd like to comment just a step further on union negotiations, because we know that's been on all of your minds. So we are optimistic that we'll reach a fair settlement for our company. We have been making good progress. The key issues really haven't changed, they're wage increases, health care benefits, work rules. And I really would like you to know that our work force has been very excited about our video opportunities, particularly in New York City. It's an opportunity in New York and in other major cities as we roll out that will create new jobs and plenty of work for our existing work force.", "So, you know, having said that, questions about where do we go with a strike, we think it would be unfortunate if a strike occurred, but we'll deal with it if and when it comes. In the meantime, we'll work hard to reach a fair settlement for our company as quickly as possible.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "", "Denny, some interesting wireless initiatives that I think Doreen touched on in the call, push-to-talk, rolling that out, integrating FiOS and wireless and then some managed mobility solutions. Perhaps you can give a little bit more color on some of those. And then, Doreen, just a quick one - what should we be thinking about for the tax rate in the second half? ", "Denny Strigl", "Simon, on the push-to-talk, last week we announced a new push-to-talk device along with our partner Motorola. Of course, it leverages our EVDO Rev A network and is actually available in our stores starting today. Unlimited push-to-talk is $10 per month on any line that has a nationwide voice plan. ", "So we'll offer more devices, incidentally, in the future, and we have a second device coming up shortly, but I have to be candid with you here. I see push-to-talk as just another part of our very broad product line. So this is one product; we think we have some upside. But again, it is just one product.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "And you've got the latency fixed on that now? It's coming in.", "Denny Strigl", "You know, Simon, I think we're in very good shape on latency, unlike what you saw from us a couple of years ago. We're in a good place.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Good. And anything on the FiOS?", "Doreen Toben", "Simon, I would say currently we're sort of working with federal, state and nonU.S. settlements between now and the end of the year, and so with that sort of as a caveat, I think the range is sort of 34% to 36%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael McCormack - J.P. Morgan.", "Michael McCormack - J.P. Morgan", "", "On the small and medium size marketplace, can you give us a sense for what you're seeing there trend-wise, whether or not you're seeing incremental cable competition as well? And secondly, on the enterprise trend, it seems like we've had a couple of data points out there about, you know, slower decision making or just a little bit more of a sluggish environment. Can you give us a sense if there's any sort of price competition that's resulting from that environment? And then lastly, maybe just some preliminary comments on what impact you may be seeing right now from the iPhone launch?", "Denny Strigl", "Okay. A number of questions there, Mike. So, looking overall at the iPhone launch, let me start with that question. As we saw with the initial introduction of Apple's iPhone, we are seeing what we think is the same. It is a minimal short-term impact. I would have to say that the impact has been disproportionately less than our relative market share, so we think that that's a good sign. ", "Apple's iPhone has actually caused what we think is a stimulation of the sales of smart phones, so if we look at our PDAs and integrated devices, we're now over 30% of our handset sales. And, as you can see from our net add results over the last three or four quarters, since the iPhone hit the market we continue to be well positioned. And our continued success, by the way, is based on our focus on the best network and best customer service and actually not on any one device.", "So you asked about small business, looking at what's occurring there we've seen some competition at the low end of the small business market. There's no doubt about it. That has come from - primarily from the cable companies. But revenues actually on small business were also impacted by some of our bundled discounting. So we're expanding FiOS Internet and video in the small business market, especially to the multi-tenant units, the MTU areas. And I think we've got some good opportunity going forward in the small business market, particularly with our FiOS product.", "Michael McCormack - J.P. Morgan", "And then just on the overall competitiveness in enterprise, any pricing actions going on or is that pretty stable?", "Denny Strigl", "Okay, we do - we have really nothing new to report that Doreen and I hadn't already mentioned I think last quarter. We do see some force downsizing, office closures, sales delays, decision delays in some of the financial services sector. However, our enterprise sales funnels remain strong, and when you add new business wins and opportunities, we really don't expect that the net effect will have any significant impact on our financial results. But Doreen might want to comment further on that.", "Doreen Toben", "No, I think, you know, we've seen, you know, enterprise has been resilient to the industry. So when you look at other sectors, though, I think that that's been a real positive for us.", "Michael McCormack - J.P. Morgan", "Are you guys seeing a disproportionate impact on the SME marketplace with respect to the economy versus large enterprise?", "Doreen Toben", "I don't think so. Certainly on the enterprise, you know, it's easier for us to see. It's more segmented. But I would say probably not.", "Denny Strigl", "I agree.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ", "", "First, on pension, just sort of knowing what you know now about equity market performance this year, Doreen, can you talk us through pension plan performance and maybe help frame the 2009 earnings sensitivity for us just as it relates to pension and OPEB? ", "And then second question just related to Northern New England, where obviously you sold a lot of lines recently. You still have systems allocated to FairPoint. As you think through planning for sort of resource allocation and cost structure, what's your expectation for how long you have to support these systems?", "Doreen Toben", "Okay, on the pension and OPEB, obviously we, you know, were similar to where the market is, although we have a lot of real estate and private equity, so our returns are probably much better than you would, you know, if you looked at the Dow or something like that. And we consistently beat benchmark. ", "Having said all that, on the pension fund, even if it's a very slight negative or zero, you know, you smooth it in over five years, so I don't expect it to be a big impact. The much bigger impact is in the discount rate, and so you don't really pick the discount rate until the end of the year. To the extent that interest rates move on us, you know, you can totally offset the impact. So, you know, until you really see the interest rate, it's hard to give you a number. ", "I mean, current course and speed, I don't expect it to be very different than it was this year. It was just like '07 and '08 are relatively flat. My expectation, short of big moves in discount rate, would be sort of similar.", "On the systems allocation, you want it?", "Denny Strigl", "Yeah, I'm happy to take that one. On the systems support for FairPoint, Jason, we actually have a contract with FairPoint to provide systems support. I believe that that takes us into the late fall, November.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay, so the expectation is that they move off end of November?", "Denny Strigl", "Yes, sir.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Doreen, on the wholesale front, do you think we're basically done with the streamlining process here? And I guess it was around a 2% impact this quarter. When do you think we'll see the financial results of that? ", "And then, Denny, just a related question, why do you think the enterprise - or Doreen - why do you think the enterprise has been so resilient? And obviously you have a lot of visibility into the second half, but maybe some guesstimates on why that's still holding up real well, particularly versus consumer. ", "Doreen Toben", "Hey, Tim, yes it - what do you mean by the wholesale 2%? I'm not sure I follow.", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Oh, I'm sorry. I think you said normalized revenue growth on business would have been about 3%?", "Doreen Toben", "Oh, okay. Okay. Yes, well, third quarter, we're mostly through with it. Fourth quarter we're totally through with it. So you'll see an impact that bumps up in third, but you'll see it much more significantly - although you see a nice bump in the third in the fourth quarter. ", "You want to do enterprise?", "Denny Strigl", "Don't have anything to add to it.", "Doreen Toben", "On the enterprise side, your question was why we think it's resilient this time?", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "", "Yes, yes.", "Doreen Toben", "I think it's a lot more, you know, in the old days it was a lot more when you lost a person, when they had the layoffs, it was the voice or the data line to the desk. I think a lot, you know, this time it's much more all your high speed lines, your DS1s and your DS3s. And so I think that that's been a big difference.", "The other impact is we have a lot more global this time, right? So, you know, that can - back before we had MCI, we had no global. Now there's a significant piece of our business which is global which has been growing nicely. ", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "And what have you done on the global front to really beef that business up, because it does look like it's doing really well.", "Denny Strigl", "We've been much more focused on multinational accounts not only headquartered here in the United States but around the world, and the IP global network that we have we think is quite superior to what others offer. So that's been a big selling point for us. Once we're able to get in with the global IP network, of course we do a fair amount of consulting and some of our strategic services. So I think that's been to our advantage.", "Doreen Toben", "I would say the Cybertrust acquisition, the security products, has done extremely well internationally.", "Denny Strigl", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Christopher Larsen - Credit Suisse.", "Christopher Larsen - Credit Suisse", "", "Doreen, you alluded to cost per FiOS installations coming down. Can you give us some parameters around that, is it, you know, now meaningful that is? And then secondly, on the Qwest business that you won, when can we start to see those Qwest subs come over, and is it your expectation that they'll begin to transfer - I think they have about 900,000 customers - will they begin to transfer those customers over to your wireless business? ", "Denny Strigl", "Chris, let me start this. On the Qwest deal, as customers come out of contract they will be migrating over to Verizon Wireless service. So we see that over time. It'll happen probably over the next 12 to 18 months. ", "Doreen Toben", "And on the FiOS piece of it, just a couple of things. Just let me do the capital for a second, you know, the big two capital metric for cost per home passed and cost per home connect, and we had given you 2010 targets of like 650 and 700. We are and we've [been saying] we are now better than our target in the cost per home passed and we are right on target, maybe a little bit better, on the cost per home connected. So on the capital side we've done extremely well. And on the expense side, which is mostly the hours in the house for the most part, they have come down nicely, so we're trending to be just about on plan. So they have been impactful. ", "The most impact, obviously, to the case on an ROIC, however, was the capital, of which we've done extremely well. ", "Ron Lataille", "Stacy, at this point I'm going to hand the call over to Mr. Strigl for some closing comments.", "Denny Strigl", "Thank you very much, Ron, and thanks everybody for your questions. And before we close the call, I'd like to just take a minute to summarize a couple of things that we have said in our call this morning.", "First, hopefully you got the sense that Doreen and I and I know Ivan, also, feels very comfortable with our business plan despite some of the concerns that others have been expressing about the economy. Although we may see some softening in some of our volumes, we do not expect any significant economic impact on our financial results in the second half of the year. ", "Our focus for the remainder of the year actually is pretty simple. We're intent on delivering top line growth and at the same time delivering bottom line performance and, as you heard from Doreen, we expect consolidated results to post solid mid-single digit revenue growth, steadily increasing margins, strong cash flow generation, and double-digit earnings growth.", "I think when we look at the first half of 2008 we're pleased with the organic momentum that we've seen across all of our operating groups in telecom. We added about 450,000 FiOS Internet customers, 439,000 FiOS TV customers, and, in fact, a week ago we added our 2 millionth FiOS Internet customer. ", "In Wireless we added nearly 3 million new customers and over 90% of these net adds were into our retail post-paid category. And in Verizon Business, strategic services grew 21% and global enterprise revenues before the strategic takebacks grew at 3.3%. ", "We've deployed capital and made investments to create this kind of organic growth, and it's converting for us into solid revenue growth. ", "Another area of focus, of course, is margins, especially on the Wireline side of the business. In the first six months we grew Wireline EBITDA, our margin, by 40 basis points year-over-year, and my view here is that we should be doing better. We have not yet gained enough momentum on the margin line and, as you heard today, we expect margins will continue to improve, and we continue to drive our organization to accelerate margin improvements. ", "But despite all of the challenges, we had double-digit earnings growth this quarter and earnings were up 14.3% yearto-date. So we're making progress. We feel good about where we are halfway through the year, and we believe that we're positioned to continue to move in the right direction.", "So thank you everyone for joining us today.", "Ron Lataille", "That concludes our call today, and thank you everyone for joining us.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "Welcome to our Third Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us and I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer. ", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication, and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website. I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. ", "A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. ", "I\u2019d like to very quickly cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings for the third quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.59, adjusted earnings per share before the effects of special items was $0.66. We are excluding two special items from adjusted results. The first is a charge of $164 million after tax or $0.06 per share for severance and other related expenses. Included in this charge are costs recognized as the result of work force reductions that are currently underway. The charges associated with the reduction are approximately 2,700 employees.", "We are also excluding a charge of $32 million after tax charge or $0.01 per share for merger integration costs. With that I will now turn the call over to Ivan for some introductory remarks.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "In light of the extraordinary events and a lot of the market uncertainty we all face we\u2019d like to briefly change the format of our call this morning. Denny and I would like to provide a few opening comments and then of course Doreen will present a full financial review of the quarters results.", "To start I\u2019d like to say that we are all very pleased with our third quarter results. Base demand and interest in our products and services remain very strong. We were able to meet competitive challenges head on without deviating from our strategic business model and make progress in delivering value to shareowners. We also learned quite a bit during the quarter to help sharpen our focus even further.", "Denny, in just a moment will provide some key insights to give you some sense of some of the operating lessons that we learned during the quarter. Going forward here a very key question for us is whether in light of all this market turmoil customer spending will continue at the same rate into the fourth quarter and even into 2009.", "For the past couple of months all of us here have been talking to our partners, our vendors and surveying our customers to see what we might expect for the rest of the year. Based on these reviews and monitoring reports from companies that already reported earnings, the general consensus is that for the Christmas season consumer spending is likely to be lighter and business spending will be somewhat curtailed until next year.", "We also believe that based on our results this quarter that you can see our business has shown remarkable stability and strength. Since we are about three quarters of the way through the year, 75% actually, we can offer some outlook for the rest of 2008. We expect for the full year 2008 our earnings per share will be somewhere around the 8% level which is consistent with the targets we actually set for ourselves at the beginning of this year with our Board.", "It\u2019s also consistent with the fact that we raised our dividend recently to 7% starting on November 1st. We consider the combination of an 8% full year 2008 along with the 7% increase in dividend as a good result for the year in light of this economy. As to 2009 we\u2019re all working very hard to figure out what the glide pass will be for customer spending and capital investments on the part of our customers and so on and so forth.", "We\u2019ll continue to work on this during the months of November and December and in January when we report our fourth quarter we\u2019ll try to give you some outlook as to how we expect the broader economy to affect the company. Most important thing though is we believe our business has the underlying strength to continue making progress along the lines of our three key business units.", "During the third quarter we also made excellent progress in securing approvals for the Alltel transaction. This transaction is pending a decision before the FCC in just a few days. Just to review the state of play, as of now we have been asked to divest about 105 markets or roughly 2.3 million of the subscriber base of Alltel. This is within the range of expected divestitures. I would also point out that during the pendency of this transaction; while it\u2019s being approved the Alltel base has also grown a little bit since the beginning of the signing of the definitive agreement.", "As most of you are well aware and based on the early questions you\u2019ve given us, as in any deal there are many last chapter issues that are being worked right now. Obviously financing costs for the deal will be somewhat higher than we thought and there are a few regulatory issues under consideration by the FCC as we speak. In our view absent a surprise or an unexpected condition we still view this deal as very compelling and we believe it will be accretive in year one and we are very focused on trying to complete this transaction as soon as approvals are done.", "I would remind everyone that even after the FCC action there are notice periods and court actions required before final approvals are really secured. As most of you know, once that happens there is a 120 period in which we are required to close the deal. This will give us the flexibility and time to work through all of the issues to close. Our goal of course is to close the deal as soon as we can.", "Now I\u2019d like to ask Denny to provide all of us with some additional insights on our operational performance this quarter.", "Denny Strigl", "Before Doreen gets into the details of the quarter I\u2019d like to give you some perspective on our performance. In Wireless I believe our business model has not been challenged. We continue to successfully deliver both growth and profitability. There was clearly tough competition in Wireless this quarter but despite this competition our network, our broad based portfolio of devices are strong distribution channels and award winning customer satisfaction helped us to add 1.5 million new customers this quarter and at the same time deliver an industry leading margin of 44.2%.", "Doreen will review the specifics on revenue growth, ARPU and churn but the bottom line is that Verizon Wireless had another strong quarter and I continue to see Wireless delivering double digit revenue growth and strong margins in the 43% to 45% range. In Telco FiOS continues to show good subscriber growth, deeper penetration and growing ARPU\u2019s. ", "Over the last year we have more than doubled video subscribers to 1.6 million and increased penetration about 500 basis points. We increased video net ads to 233,000 this quarter and opened 1.2 million additional homes for sale in the quarter which of course will help growth in the fourth quarter.", "Despite the rhetoric of the cable companies and their advocates FiOS is a growing formidable competitor. For example, in just the first three months FiOS TV has achieved a 10% penetration in Staten Island here in New York City. On average FiOS TV achieves 17% penetration in just 12 months and over 26% penetration within two years. These numbers are better than we had anticipated.", "The next couple of months we will be two thirds through our fiber build out and FiOS is on plan both operationally and financially. We will continue to see a shift of access lines they\u2019ll go primarily to Wireless but FiOS is scaling and clearly helping to grow consumer ARPU and helping margins. FiOS feature enhancements should also provide further ARPU growth so this has been our strategy and we continue to see up side potential for FiOS.", "The global enterprise market remains very competitive. Demand for IP and managed services are the key drivers here as we continue to transform our product mix. Our strategic services portfolio is a good indicator of this transition and these services grew over 15% this quarter and now account for 29% of total Verizon Business revenues.", "CIO\u2019s remain heavily reliant on the RFP process and we\u2019ve seen some aggressive competition in pricing and bidding for long term contracts. We\u2019ve had our share of wins and of course we have been disciplined in our pricing. We\u2019re looking to balance new business growth and margins. Although sales funnels are strong we realize the consolidation in the financial services sector and in uncertain economic environment will likely have an impact in the short term.", "Longer term the goal is to grow Verizon Business at GDP plus levels and we\u2019re changing the product mix and developing the capabilities to deliver this level of growth in the future as enterprise customers seek more bandwidth capabilities, add new applications, and buy managed services.", "Finally, overall we\u2019ve maintained our operating flexibility seizing on a number of opportunities to reduce costs through organizational efficiencies and process improvements. Fiber for example continues for us to show great promise for lowering our operating costs. From my perspective, the key strategic areas of the business Wireless, FiOS and strategic business products are all performing well.", "We continue to try to balance these growth areas, losses in the traditional access lines and profitability. Our diversified portfolio will help us through any economic slow down but we will monitor volumes and remain operationally flexible.", "Doreen I\u2019ll turn it over to you now and Doreen will review the details of the quarter.", "Doreen Toben", "Let\u2019s start with some of the key highlights for the quarter. Consolidated revenues grew $1.3 billion or 5.4%. Verizon Wireless had another excellent quarter with double digit revenue growth of 12.5% very solid customer growth with 1.5 million retail net adds excluding acquisitions and sustained strong profitability with an EBITDA margin on service revenues of 44.2%.", "We posted improved FiOS numbers this quarter with 233,000 new TV subscribers and 225,000 new internet customers. The continued penetration of FiOS drove nearly 40% growth in total broadband and video revenues this quarter. Within Verizon Business strategic services revenues continued to grow up more than 5% sequentially and 15% year over year.", "We continue to be very disciplined and focused in our capital spending. We\u2019re on track to deliver a lower overall spend than 2007, even after taking into account about $200 million of integration capital related to rural cellular. As a result, our CapEx to revenue ratio has improved 120 basis points year to date and cash flows from operations less CapEx is significantly higher than a year ago. Our $0.66 of diluted EPS from continuing operations this quarter brings us to $1.93 year to date up 10.3% over last year.", "Let\u2019s talk about the quarter in more detail. As you can see on slide four our top line grew nearly $1.3 billion or 5.4% this quarter on a year over year basis and is up 5.3% through nine months. Operating income this quarter grew 5.3% and is up 10.1% year to date. Our year to date operating income margin grew 80 basis points to 18.6%. Consolidated EBITDA is up $1.5 billion or 6.5% year to date and our year to date EBITDA margin has expanded to 33.5%.", "On the next slide you can see our strong cash generation profile. For the first nine months of this year cash flow from continuing operations was about $19.1 billion up 5.9% compared with last year. Our revenue growth and lower capital spending are improving the capital intensity of the business. On a year to date basis total CapEx was $12.6 billion which is around $200 million less than we spent this time last year.", "Our CapEx to revenue for the nine months was 17.4% an improvement of 120 basis points compared with the year ago. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong with net debt of $44 billion and net debt to EBITDA of less than 1.4 times. I would also add that we have not experienced a significant impact on our overall borrowing from the recent spike in short term interest rates.", "At the end of the third quarter more than two thirds of our total debt portfolio consisted of fixed rate debt. As a result the rate of interest that we pay on our debt was not significantly affected by recent fluctuations in interest rates. Also access to Commercial Paper markets has not been an issue for us although for a brief period we did pay higher interest rates than we have paid under normal market conditions.", "However, we\u2019re not talking about anything of significance here. Our Commercial Paper balance at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion about the same place we were at the end of June. In addition, on September 30th we closed on a $4.4 billion three year term loan for Verizon Wireless that refinanced the majority of the 364 day credit facility that we entered into in June to purchase Alltel debt at a discount and to fund our acquisition of Rural Cellular.", "Let\u2019s now turn our attention to the segment results beginning with Verizon Wireless on slide six. We had another strong quarter of high quality retail customer growth. Excluding acquisitions total net adds for the quarter were 1.5 million all of which were retail and essentially all post paid. We also added about 650,000 customers to our base through our acquisition of Rural Cellular. Our total customer base is 70.8 million; 68.8 million are retail and largely post paid with just under three million pre-paid customers and only two million customers from re-sellers.", "Gross adds in the quarter were strong up 5.8% compared with a year ago. We continue to lead the industry in customer loyalty. Total churn of 1.33% was up six basis points year over year and retail post paid churn of 1.03% was up seven basis points from a year ago quarter. Turning to revenues, Wireless turned in another strong performance once again delivering double digit growth. Service revenue grew to $10.9 billion this quarter up 12.2% year over year and 4.2% sequentially.", "Total service ARPU increased 0.9% to $52.18. Similar to last quarter 70% of the growth in total service revenue is from Wireless data. Data now represents 25.5% of total service revenue. The main drivers of growth continue to be broadband access and usage, email and messaging. Data revenues in the quarter grew 42.5% year over year. Data ARPU was up 28.3% over last year. About two thirds of this growth is from non-messaging services. Mobile broadband access through PC cards and email through SmartPhones are experiencing very high growth.", "SmartPhones represented about 30% of the retail devices sold in the quarter. There\u2019s plenty of momentum and upside here to increase penetration.", "We have some exciting new devices coming this quarter including the much anticipated Blackberry Storm which has received a number of very positive reviews. As we said before future growth opportunities will be driven our enhanced spectrum position. Our 4G plans with LCE and the innovation we expect to see with our open development initiative. These opportunities position us well for future Wireless growth model which we believe will be driven by the number of connections and total revenues.", "To summarize Wireless, we had another strong quarter of results across the board with solid customer and revenue growth coupled with strong profitability in a very competitive environment. Our focus on increasing our retail market share customer retention and improving operational efficiency has resulted in sustained growth, industry leading margins and substantial cash flow.", "EBITDA this quarter grew 11% year over year and is up more than 12% year to date. Our EBITDA margin on service revenue was 44.2% this quarter and 44.9% year to date. Year to date Wireless capital spending totaled $4.7 billion. The CapEx to revenue ratio for the year is 12.9% an improvement of 220 basis points from a year ago.", "Lastly, Verizon Wireless has won more top honors than any other carrier in the four JD Power customer satisfaction surveys released since August. These studies looked at retail sales and customer care nationally and overall customer satisfaction and call quality by region.", "Let\u2019s next move to Wireline starting with the consumer market. Our FiOS triple play continues to be a powerful offer and remains at the center of our consumer strategy. In the third quarter we entered a number of new video markets including New York City and began marketing to an additional 1.2 million homes. We are quite pleased with our early progress in New York City although I would say that it was only one factor in the strong results across the board.", "The sharp increase in homes opened for sale this quarter bodes well for customer growth in subsequent quarters. We added 233,000 new FiOS TV customers this quarter. So far this year we have added over 670,000 new TV subscribers, expanded market availability by nearly 40% and increased penetration by almost 400 basis points to 20%.", "We are also continuing to add features, enhancements and upgrades that no other provider can match. For example, we\u2019ve expanded the multi-room features of our home media DVR to include HD content. Now customers can view a recorded HD program on other TV sets in the home provided they have an HD set top box.", "Customers can instantly upgrade to premium content channels straight from an on demand menu using the remote control. We\u2019ve introduced new channel sorting options in a way for me feature which allows customers to pause live programming, change channels and then return to the paused program and pick up watching right where they left off. ", "There\u2019s more to come very shortly including the ability to program the DVR from your cell phone, view FaceBook on your TV screen and search and view YouTube clips on the TV with your remote. These features, enhancements and upgrades help highlight the growth potential of the FiOS platform.", "On the Broadband side we added 129,000 new subscribers about 140% better than last quarter. FiOS internet ads jumped up to 225,000 and we saw some improvement in DSL. FiOS internet penetration now stands at 24% which is an improvement of more than 300 basis points this year. Fiber to the home now covers more than one third of our households and nearly 70% of these homes path can buy our video service. As we move into the end of this year we\u2019re on track with our FiOS build out and ahead of expectations with FiOS TV penetration. ", "On the traditional access line side of the business we did not see a significant sequential change in retail residential primary lines which were down 571,000 and total switch access lines declined by one million. As I said earlier FiOS remains the center of our consumer strategy and it has helped offset secular line loss trends. ", "As you can see on slide 10 broadband and video continued to be the big drivers of consumer revenue growth. Legacy consumer revenues in the quarter were up 2.1% year over year. Broadband and video revenues totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter up 45% from a year ago. We are also seeing consistently strong growth in consumer retail ARPU which is now nearly $67 up 12.8% from a year ago. The overall FiOS ARPU continues to grow and is more than $130 per month. The FiOS triple play ARPU is even higher.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at Verizon Business, revenues from IP and strategic products continue to show solid growth up over 15% in the third quarter. Sales funnels remain strong and we\u2019ve had some major customer wins. Total revenue growth for Verizon Business improved this quarter to 1.2% from last quarters 0.9%. Pricing remains competitive particularly for long term contracts with the largest enterprise customers. We will remain disciplined and balance market share wins and margins.", "Although we have not seen any significant impact from the financial services sector yet consolidation in this sector may have some impact in the next couple of quarters. As I look at the business segment there continues to be a shift to strategic services like private IP, managed services and security. We continue to work through some strategic take back losses from earlier this year and closely monitor the financial services sector. We\u2019re pursuing Federal Government networks contract opportunities and we continue to expand our international products and capabilities such as the private IP network in India.", "In summarizing Wireline I\u2019d like to say that we\u2019ve continued to make progress in improving the overall revenue mix as broadband and video revenue now comprise 29% of legacy consumer revenues as compared with 20% a year ago. We continue to believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in both the consumer and business markets. Our Wireline EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 27.3%. While we remain committed to expanding Wireline margins we now believe that our original improvement targets will take longer to achieve than originally planned.", "With regard to FiOS we are on plan both financially and operationally. Finally, we remain focused on reducing the Wireline cost structure. We have a good track record of taking costs out of the business. For example, we have reduced our Wireline work force by more than 10,000 positions in the past year. We also have additional cost reduction initiatives underway which will help lower our overall Wireline expenses.", "To summarize, through the first nine months of the year we have delivered revenue, earnings and free cash flow growth. Our balance sheet is healthy and we have access to liquidity. The 7% dividend increase announced last month reflects the confidence we have in our cash flow outlook. Verizon\u2019s dividend yield currently ranks within the top 10% of the S&P 500. From my perspective the quarter was solid. Volumes and revenues in our key strategic area grew, the capital intensity of the business continues to improve and cash flow remains strong.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it back to Ron.", "Ron Lataille", "We\u2019re now available to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Were you guys surprised with the strength that we saw in the iPhone this quarter and given the margin guidance are you going to be able to maintain the net add momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter and next year? I think Ivan said there is still expected to be accretion in the first year of the Alltel deal are we still talking in the neighborhood of about a dime?", "Denny Strigl", "I think your iPhone question probably relates to churn. Our churn rate remained very low in the quarter as you saw. On a sequential basis we tend to see some seasonality in the third quarter about 10 basis points. I\u2019m not really concerned about the year over year churn which was up about six basis points. Specifically to your question on the iPhone, yes of course we did see some churn to the iPhone during the quarter. Our focus has been on a broad based portfolio of devices and maintaining our margins in the 43% to 45% level we think we will be able to do that into the future.", "Our plan is certainly to continue to grow at the kinds of numbers you have seen in this quarter. We have a very competitive model in Wireless, I think you know this. We meet the competition head on. We\u2019re not whetted to just any one iconic device. We\u2019re pleased with our result and I think you can continue to see similar results that\u2019s our plan going forward.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "The issue on the Alltel accretion the way we would look at it is that we\u2019re not prepared to give a specific level of guidance on this. The early estimates as you said were about a dime and a lot of that is being eaten up by some of the financing costs. We still have some work to do in terms of the sequencing of the financing and we have 120 days after the final approvals. The business is performing very well so one of the things that we\u2019re very pleased with is the Alltel management people have done a very good job of maintaining their focus during this period of time.", "I think as we get more insight into the operating plan we\u2019ll be able to determine and give you better outlook as we get closer to actual close. Our goal is to still make sure in year ones its accretive.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Good progress on capital spending bringing down both the absolute and the percent of revenues. Can you talk a little bit about what we should see in 2009 given some of the macro concerns and also where we are in terms of ability to start spending on LTE and any improvements in the efficiency of cost per home pass installed on the FiOS side.", "Denny Strigl", "We have begun spending on LTE. We have a trial that is going. We are not disclosing specific spending on LTE. I can tell you looking at our capital spend plans for next year we\u2019ll continue to bring our spend as a percent of revenue down. We will probably given the economic circumstances that we\u2019re in we will probably start out slower in the first quarter than what we did first quarter this year. At this point that\u2019s about all we\u2019re prepared to say about capital other than you can see it continue to come down as a percent of revenue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan", "Can you give us maybe a little more clarity on the Wireline margin improvement story and the levers there? I know you mentioned FiOS sort of tracking in line with your expectations but can you give us any sort of magnitude on what kind of a drag it is right now? Also on the VZ Business side can you give us a sense for what the margins look like there?", "Denny Strigl", "Looking at Wireline margin FiOS is on plan. Our productivity on FiOS is on track. As you saw we had better volumes in the quarter, with some additional promotional activity. We\u2019re feeling good from the standpoint of our productivity and our FiOS plans. We had contract wins in Verizon Business as I said during the quarter. Some of those wins come with up front costs. We\u2019ve seen more competitive pricing in Verizon Business. Of course we\u2019ve seen this secular pressures continue in our Telco group. ", "We continue to manage the cost structure like forced reductions that we are undertaking now primarily in Telco but also some consolidation on the business side additionally. We expect to hold margins in the fourth quarter. We continue to target a long term goal of 30% to 33% margins for Wireline. The timing may be longer than expected. The uncertainty of the economy of course adds some risk to the timing.", "Improving Wireline margins clearly we can say it will be driven by a number of things, continued FiOS scale and productivity improvements, reducing our structural costs including access rates in VZB which we\u2019ve been working on for the last 18 months or so and seeing some progress there. We will increase non-access cost bearing services, the reductions like managed services, IP infrastructure we think we\u2019ve got some cost savings to realize there. We have been focused on that over the course of this year.", "Of course we will continue to focus on cost reductions like force automation, our VSO organization helps in that regard. Again, we expect to hold margins in the fourth quarter in spite of the economy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citigroup", "Following up on some of the comments about trying to curtail costs, I was wondering if you could talk more specifically about the opportunities for headcount reduction. I think you announced some in the quarter. Also if you go back five years ago after the last union contract if I remember correctly there was a voluntary program and the reductions I think were on a net basis or about 18,000 five years ago in the fourth quarter of \u201903. I was wondering if you could talk about the opportunities to help margins from those types of cost cutting activities over the next 12 months.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Perhaps I can just give a broader comment on this subject. If you watched over the past three or four years we\u2019ve had a steady decrease in employee headcount. In those portions of the business that\u2019s going through the biggest transition. You can see steady quarter over quarter and year over year transformation of the headcount reduction in the Telco and you can see the charge that Doreen described this quarter of 2,700 management people its just part of that.", "I think it would be fair to say that with that we\u2019ll continue to work on reducing other headcount in the Telco namely associates as we continue to roll out FiOS. We\u2019ve been doing that on a consistent steady basis. There\u2019s nothing in the union contract that either triggers that or prevents us from doing that. I think that what we wanted to make sure in this current contract is that we didn\u2019t lose any of the flexibility that we had been using for the past three or four years. That\u2019s kind of where we are.", "I would also make the point that we\u2019ve also had significant opportunities and we\u2019ve done this to remove structural costs at VZB and we\u2019ve done that as well. Denny might comment on a couple of the broader areas that we\u2019re looking at but for the most part we\u2019re dealing with continued improvements in operational flexibility with our networks and we\u2019re dealing with minding the value out of our Verizon services organization to do better with procurement, network operations and things of that nature.", "Of course you know we continue to add headcount in Wireless where we need it. Overall you should expect the headcount number to come down in those parts of the company in which we\u2019re transforming the business and as technology keeps eating away at the access line base moving many of those lines to Wireless you will see us continue to transform the base.", "Denny Strigl", "I would just add one, this is down in the weeds a bit but we have numerous real estate consolidation occurring. This should save us money into \u201909. A lot of consolidation particularly related to the downsizing in our Telco force.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America.", "David Barden - Banc of America", "On the Alltel transaction I think you kind of alluded to the fact that the difference in the credit markets today versus when the deal was struck has eroded. I think you said a good portion of the potential dime that was there the FCC is considering eliminating CEDC revenues which are a meaningful percentage of the ARPU of Alltel. I guess I understand the point that it can be done but is this a deal that still should be done under the current terms and conditions that you\u2019ve agreed to? Why wouldn\u2019t it be better for the shareholders to take advantage of your potential strength in this negotiation and try for something more attractive?", "The second question on FiOS being on track, I know you\u2019ve targeted EBITDA positive in the second half of \u201908 I was wondering if you could tell us if you hit that and whether what we\u2019re seeing on the DSL front was originally part of the business plan for FiOS and whether FiOS can really hit its plan if DSL is still falling at about $100,000 a quarter.", "Doreen Toben", "FiOS is on plan and is actually EBITDA positive this quarter so we\u2019re very pleased with that. On your DSL question no I don\u2019t think it will impact the FiOS net adds at all we will continue. We\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing certainly into the late part of the quarter and continue to be on plan which is why we\u2019ve actually upped some our own estimates on where we think we be with FiOS, very strong there.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "The Alltel transaction as I said in the opening is compelling so you start with the early estimate of $9 billion and NTV coming from the deal. You look at the fact that when you look at the future synergies of combining the Alltel customer base and the network with us I think the operating opportunities for leverage are just off the chart. The issue is that when we look at this short term issue of financing and some of these FCC issues on US, first of all the book isn\u2019t finely written on all those things so my guess is we shouldn\u2019t be drinking the Kool-Aid until we see all of the final conditions on that.", "When it\u2019s all said and done this is a transaction that pays for itself, probably will pay for itself multiple times over. We do have admittedly an issue in which the early returns will be lower than we thought but in no way will the long term benefit of this deal be negated by some of these short term issues. It is a deal that should get done and is a deal that, by the way I would make a point that the speed at which Government is looking at this should tell everybody that even they think this is a deal that should get done. ", "We haven\u2019t had to push them as hard as we normally would because they\u2019re looking at this and they\u2019re suggesting that telecommunications is one of the stable industries right now and all of this turmoil that\u2019s going on and a little consolidation is a good thing. We even read about some of it this morning in the [inaudible] base. I think it\u2019s a good thing for people to see that kind of consolidation. Yes, we agree that it didn\u2019t quite meet what we originally thought but in the longer term it\u2019s going to exceed everything we ever thought.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays.", "Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays", "I think you mentioned in your opening remarks that homes open for sale is going to increase as New York City ramps. Can you give us some sort of idea of the magnitude of that? For example, in 4Q07 I think you opened 1.2 million new home opened for sale. In first quarter it was closer to 500,000. Are we going to be north of a million for the next several quarters or somewhere in between that range?", "Denny Strigl", "Actually where we will be is very close to what you saw in the third quarter. We did have New York City opening in the third quarter but we continue to ramp up I\u2019d say that our range will be in about the one million level.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse.", "Chris Larsen - Credit Suisse", "A point of clarification do you need to sell the 105 markets that need to be divested in order to close the Alltel transaction? The last recession we saw a slower wireless growth which eventually led to competitive pricing. We\u2019re in a different environment now that where everybody\u2019s got significant share. How do you think either Verizon plays itself out in a slower wireless market or how some of your competitors may also play it out?", "Denny Strigl", "We\u2019re really not seeing any significant slow down or impact in Wireless at this point. We\u2019re right on the target that we had set for ourselves. We don\u2019t see any shifting to lower priced packages, but as you may have seen in our numbers a very good data growth. Our expectation is that we\u2019ll continue to see that data accelerate. We had 80 billion text messages alone in the quarter. A big part of that is text but also use of email, PDA, SmartPhones, I think we\u2019ve got a good growth opportunity going forward.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "On the Alltel question we will be permitted to put the markets in trust and they will be operated separately. I might add by the way when you put all those subscribers into our company it\u2019s a fairly substantially sized business. It will be operated separate and are out the close the deal pending the final sales of those properties.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Do you expect any other regulatory changes out of the FCC between now and the end of the year? They sent out a fairly large agenda for the meeting next week. Secondly on the enterprise business front do you think the pricing pressure is coming more from competition or is it just more from new technologies bundling voice and with data. It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of competitors out there really on the business front it\u2019s really just you and AT&T have the lion\u2019s share of the market out there.", "Denny Strigl", "I don\u2019t see anything other than everything we all know about what the FCC is going. I think obviously the devil is always in the details. We\u2019re doing our part to work through it but I think the November 4th agenda is the last big thing for the year. Hopefully there are a lot of things that the FCC is doing that we think will continue to make the industry more rational depending on the absolute details and we\u2019re working our way through that. I don\u2019t see anything of a major surprise happening November 4th.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "On the enterprise competition question I think this is coming strictly from competition. It is competition that is driving the prices down. We know this; we participate in every big deal across the country and around the world. Our goal here is to be very careful in balancing our new customers, resigning our existing customers and protecting the margin at the same time. As I mentioned in my opening remarks our goal is to grow at GDP plus levels. ", "Some of the new product that we see which includes by the way just more bandwidth that customers are asking for but also new applications and managed services, those come at a very good profit margin for us, as you see in our numbers some very good growth out of managed services in particular. The overall answer to your question is competition is what\u2019s impacting pricing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "On Wireless, what percent of the customer base upgraded handsets this quarter? I know you talked about the external channel 30% of gross adds coming in on SmartPhones. What is that percentage look like for the subscribers upgrading within your own base? I know it\u2019s early but any comments on pensions in terms of the magnitude of the EPS impact in \u201909. Do you think there\u2019s going to be any sort cash contribution requirements in the pension funds?", "Doreen Toben", "Similar to any other investor\u2019s portfolio certainly our portfolio is negative at this point. Where it ends the year is anybody\u2019s guess at this point as far as end of December. We do have a smoothing impact so it will take us five years to smooth it in. Depending on the discount rate which we can\u2019t pick until December 31st there might be some mitigation. We really don\u2019t know the full impact from a P&L standpoint until the end of December.", "However, from a funding perspective our last K had a number of a little bit over $300 million. Current course and speed that is still a good number for funding in \u201909 so in the $300 million assuming the fund is sort of where it is as of mid-October. As far as the upgrade number that is not a number that we give out as far as percentage of upgrades.", "Ron Lataille", "That will conclude our questions and I\u2019d like to hand it off to Ivan now for a couple of summary comments.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Thank you all for attending the call. A couple of quick points, if there are any points of emphasis we\u2019d like you to consider this quarter a couple of things. First of all we had what we thought is a good quarter in light of this entire economic uncertainty around the world. A couple things unique to us is that our business shows remarkable stability and strength. We think we have an approach to dealing with the competitive forces that will continue to allow us to sustain good performance in this marketplace.", "In Wireless you can see we have the belief we can continue to grow. We can continue to add vertical capabilities and ARPU\u2019s and at the same time manage our costs and our overall business to maintain our margin levels. FiOS what we\u2019re seeing is in spite of all of the secular shifts going on we were able to increase ARPU\u2019s and increase penetration so that is a physics problem for us which is how quickly can we get the stuff deployed and as Denny said we\u2019re two thirds of the way through which is pretty significant. We have very, very specific performance metrics that we have been meeting now for the past two or three years and you can see that.", "In Verizon Enterprise what you see there is that we also have a very disciplined approach. Our sales activities are very vibrant but we are running into the fact that customers are beginning to time some of their spending a little differently. As Denny said we\u2019re working really hard to make sure that we improve the product mix within Verizon Business so we can keep adding all of those strategic capabilities that customers are looking for.", "The unspoken thing on this call is this whole issue of access line loss and just very quickly what I\u2019d like to say on that is that we\u2019re not surprised at the access line loss. We\u2019ve been saying now for a couple years that DSL itself was going to become less potent. Wireless is obviously much more of a substitute capability going forward. ", "The issue for us is that this issue of Wireline margins and access line losses trying to balance this issue on the head of a pin has been difficult. What we feel is that we have momentum going in all of the growth areas so that as we get through this tunnel and we are beginning to see light at the end of it we can start to continue to show a lot of growth. ", "Somebody earlier mentioned that they see our CapEx to spending ratio as coming down so you can see that all of the capital that we\u2019ve been putting into these growth areas is starting to give us some leverage to improve the capital ratios and return on investor capital for the business. ", "Lastly, we tried to give you some outlook for the fourth quarter. We think an 8% EPS return in this environment is a very good result along with a 7% dividend. We\u2019re anxious to talk to you about 2009 and we\u2019ll do that in January. With that we think you all for your attending the call.", "Ron Lataille", "That concludes our call today.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "Good morning everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter 2008 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us and I\u2019m Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer and Doreen Toben, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the investor relations website. This call is being web cast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. A discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC which of course are available on our website.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "I\u2019d like to very quickly cover the differences between reported and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter. Reported earnings per diluted share were $0.43. Adjusted earnings per share before the effects of special items were $0.61. We are excluding two special items from adjusted results. The first is an after-tax charge of $424 million or $0.15 per share for severance and other related expenses. Included in this charge are pension settlement losses for employees receiving lump sum distributions resulting from our previous separation plan as well as charges associated with additional employee severance in 2009.", "We are also excluding an after-tax charge of $35 million or $0.01 per share for merger integration costs as well as a charge of $31 million after tax or $0.01 related to an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investments in certain marketable securities. With that I will now turn the call over to Ivan for some opening remarks.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Thank you Ron and good morning everyone. Before Doreen presents a full financial review of the quarter\u2019s results, Denny and I would like to provide a few opening comments.", "To state the obvious, 2008 was a difficult economic environment and there was more than the usual uncertainty as we try to plan for 2009. It is pleasing to report however that throughout 2008 we stayed focused on our strategic business model and made progress in delivering value to our customers and shareholders. We were able to grow earnings more than 7%, increase the dividend by 7% and grow free cash flow before dividends by about 14%.", "We feel confident that we took the right steps during the year to maximize growth and potential returns of the business going forward. For example, we improved our spectrum position with the purchase of nationwide 700 MHz licenses, we acquired the Rural Cellular and Alltel properties and we spun off some wire line properties in northern New England, passed more than 3 million additional phones with fiber, opened 3.3 million homes for sale of our FiOS TV service and expanded FiOS availability in big city markets like New York.", "We also reached long-term agreements with our labor unions, the CWA and IBEW and very progressively put that issue behind us. As we expanded our worldwide reach, product and service portfolio and customer support capabilities for our large enterprise customers served by Verizon Business.", "Our strategic investments are driving innovation and allow us to have better products and services and therefore be a very formidable competitor in every market we serve. As a result, we were able to effectively gain share and at the same time grow revenues by 5% and increase ARPU\u2019s, the key metrics for our success.", "Denny and Doreen will review many of the operating numbers with you but I think the results reflect solid execution by each business unit and in the context of 2009 indicate that we clearly have the potential to continue to perform well both absolutely and relatively in this very challenging market.", "With that I would like to ask Denny now to provide us with some additional comments on our operational performance.", "Denny Strigl", "Thank you Ivan. Good morning everyone. I share Ivan\u2019s confidence. Our business will continue to compete effectively and we think it will do so within any environment. Within each of our businesses that means we must continue to innovate and be leaders in the marketplace and I think we can demonstrate that leadership in each of our strategic areas in 2008 and I\u2019d like to give you some examples.", "In wireless we launched a total of 36 new devices in 2008, more than 1/3 of which were PDA\u2019s or Smart phones and we already have about two dozen new devices scheduled to launch in the first half of 2009. We were the first to introduce nationwide unlimited plan aimed at the high end of the market and the first to introduce megabit pricing for data usage.", "Our open development initiative is another platform for innovation and we made solid progress partnering with developers this past year with 29 approved open development devices. We were again recognized by industry organizations and publications in 2008 for providing the highest level of satisfaction and setting the standard for customer service for the wireless industry. Just last week our focus on providing customers with the most reliable network service paid off at the Presidential inauguration when our service held up under the strain of significantly higher than normal usage while others struggled.", "FiOS was also a market leader in 2008. In terms of speed we expanded our industry leading consumer broadband connection speeds of up to 50MB downstream and 20MB upstream to our entire FiOS footprint. We expanded our high definition offer to include over 100 HD channels. We continued to add features, enhancements and upgrades that no other provider has matched in our home media DVR, interactive media guide, content search and interactive widgets. FiOS has been recognized by various publications and surveys as being a superior, best in class service.", "In Verizon Business we continued to expand our capabilities as a leading provider of advanced communications and IT solutions to governments and businesses throughout the world. Nearly 70% of our customers have or are in the process of transitioning to private IP services. As in our other businesses, industry experts and partners gave us recognition for our capabilities throughout the year.", "Although the environment continues to be challenging from both a competitive and economic perspective our strategic focus has not changed. We will continue to focus on growing revenue, taking share and at the same time improving profitability. So from our perspective the fourth quarter demonstrates that our business continues to perform well both operationally and financially. If you look at the fourth quarter in absolute terms or relative to our historic growth it was a good quarter.", "We delivered year-over-year revenue growth in all strategic areas, over 12% in wireless, nearly 37% in broadband and video and over 8% in the key strategic services offered by Verizon Business. In addition, ARPU grew 1.4% in wireless and over 14% in consumer. Customer growth was also good this quarter. 1.4 million wireless net adds, record net adds for FiOS with over 300,000 new TV subscribers and 282,000 new FiOS internet customers.", "We also saw some sequential improvement in retail residence primary line losses and DSL. We were also focused on productivity of course and improving productivity throughout 2008. Wireless once again showed improvement in our already industry-leading cash cost for subscriber metrics and we remain the industry leader in margins. In FiOS we reduced install times by 15%. In addition the Telco group reduced force by over 10,000 last year and by the way over 22,000 in the last three years.", "So as we said in the third quarter, Verizon Business also saw some increasing competitive pricing pressures and some up front costs related to new contract wins that affected our margins. This quarter some volume declines tied to a weakening economy increased the pressures on margins.", "In summary, we made progress but we can do more and we will stay operationally flexible and look for ways to simplify the business and manage the cost structure for long-term margin improvement.", "Doreen, I will now turn it over to you for a review of the details of the quarter.", "Doreen Toben", "Thanks Denny. Turning to slide five, consolidated revenues grew nearly $1.1 billion or 4.6% in the fourth quarter, finishing the year at $97.1 billion representing top line growth of 5.1% in 2008. Our margins also expanded in the fourth quarter and full year. Operating income grew 6.6% in the fourth quarter and 9.2% for the year with full year margin expansion of 70 basis points.", "EBITDA grew 5.4% in the fourth quarter and 6.2% for the full year with a 2008 EBITDA margin increasing to 33.5%. Finally, we ended the year with earnings from continuing operations of $2.54 per share, up 7.6%.", "Turning next to cash flows and the balance sheet we ended the year with $26.6 billion in cash flows from continuing operations. As we expected, total capital spending declined $300 million year-over-year to $17.2 billion. A ratio of CapEx to revenue improved 120 basis points to finish the year at 17.8%.", "In 2008 we also returned value to share owners paying $5 billion in dividends and repurchasing approximately 1.4 billion of our stock. Our balance sheet metrics remain strong with net debt of $42.2 billion including more than $9 billion in cash held in anticipation of the Alltel closing and net debt to EBITDA of about 1.3 times at the end of 2008.", "With regard to the financing for the Alltel transaction we used a combination of Verizon Wireless and Alltel cash, proceeds from pre-funding and the $12.35 billion bank ridge loan to fund the acquisition. Looking ahead we anticipate the bridge loan will be paid off with Verizon Wireless free cash flow, proceeds from the required asset divestitures and turn out financing which we estimate will be somewhere between $6-7 billion.", "Now let\u2019s look at our segments beginning with wireless.  Wireless had a strong quarter of high quality retail customer growth capping a year in which we added 5.8 million organic net new retail customers. Excluding divestitures, total net adds for the fourth quarter were 1.4 million, all of these were retail and 93% were post-paid. We divested a net 122,000 customers, primarily rural cellular markets as part of a previously announced exchange agreement with another carrier. We ended the year with a total customer base of 72.1 million, 67 million of which were retail post paid.", "We have just over 3 million pre-paid customers and only 2 million customers from resellers. Retail gross adds in the fourth quarter were essentially flat both sequentially and year-over-year. On an annual basis retail gross adds were up 3.5%. Churn was up two basis points sequentially and on a year-over-year basis total churn was up 15 basis points to 1.35% and retail post paid churn was up 11 basis points to 1.05%.", "We also maintained a strong wireless revenue performance delivering double digit revenue growth for the quarter and for the year. Total revenue grew 12.3% in the fourth quarter and 12.4% for the full year. Service revenue grew by 12% on both a quarterly and annual basis. Total service APRU increased 1.4% in the quarter and 1.2% for the full year making this 11 consecutive quarter\u2019s of year-over-year growth in ARPU.", "As we have seen all year, about 70% of service revenue growth is driven by wireless data. Wireless data represented 26.8% of total service revenue in the fourth quarter. Data revenue is now in excess of $10 billion annually, up 44% in 2008. Total data ARPU in the fourth quarter grew by $3.02 or nearly 28% year-over-year.", "The main drivers of this growth continue to be broadband access and usage, email and messaging. Revenue from non-messaging data services represents more than half of the total wireless data revenue. Non-messaging data revenues grew 2% in the fourth quarter and 53% for the year. The fact is, we are still in the early stages of non-messaging services with relatively modest adoption rates so far so we continue to see plenty of upside potential as we further penetrate the customer base and as the proliferation of new devices stimulates demand for more and more wireless data usage.", "Smart phone sales continue to accelerate representing more than 37% of the retail devices sold in the fourth quarter up from 30% last quarter. Obviously we expect that the ARPU, particularly the data component, will be significantly higher from these devices. With our enhanced spectrum position, 4G plans with LTE and our open development initiatives we are well positioned to compete for future wireless data growth. As it is today, our focus will be on driving revenue growth, increasing ARPU and generating cash flow.", "We also enhanced our growth opportunities through the acquisition of Alltel. This acquisition has many compelling, long-term strategic benefits. It expands our network to cover nearly the entire United States population, improves our revenue mix by increasing the wireless portion to about 55% of total Verizon and makes us the largest U.S. carrier in terms of total customers which will be in excess of 80 million following the required divestitures.", "In addition, the Alltel merger also provides us with significant synergy opportunities. To refresh your memory, we identified saving opportunities with a net present value in excess of $9 billion. Our estimate for cost synergies both capital and expense as well as the estimates for integration costs to achieve those synergies are unchanged from our announcement last June. Having just closed the transaction we are still reviewing the Alltel financials to determine our opening balance sheet. Higher than expected financing and interest costs will impact earnings accretion in the short-term however this is clearly a value creating transaction.", "To summarize, Verizon wireless continues to demonstrate success in achieving both strong growth and profitability. Chart ten displays an impressive list of metrics for 2008. Our continued focus on increasing retail market share, retaining customers and improving operational efficiency has resulted in sustained double-digit revenue growth, increasing ARPU, industry leading margins and substantial cash flow.", "The EBITDA margin on service revenue was 37.2% in the fourth quarter and 45.5% for the full year. We have some favorable impact in the fourth quarter which resulted in higher profitability than normal. Absent these items the fourth quarter and full-year margin would have been in the 45%+ range. Going forward you should continue to expect us to maintain EBITDA margins within the previously stated range of 43-45%.", "Wireless capital spending for the year was $6.5 billion and the CapEx to ratio revenue was 13.2% at year end, an annual improvement of 160 basis points.", "Let\u2019s next move to wire line, starting with the consumer market. Our FiOS results this quarter demonstrate the power of our triple play offer and show the resilience of our value proposition even in a slowing economy. We had our best FiOS quarter ever with record net adds for both TV and internet. While we remain pleased with our progress in New York City I will once again say it was only one factor in a strong result across the board.", "During the fourth quarter we added 303,000 new FiOS TV customers, ending the year with just over 1.9 million subscribers and a penetration rate of 21%. During 2008 we more than doubled our TV subscriber base, adding 975,000 customers and increased our penetration by roughly 500 basis points. At the same time we also significantly expanded the availability of the FiOS triple play, ending 2008 with 9.2 million homes open for sale for FiOS TV and a 57% increase in market availability in just one year.", "More than 2.2 million of these homes opened for sale in the third and fourth quarters and earlier this month we passed the one million mark for premises open for sale in the multi dwelling unit or MDU category. So we are clearly building momentum and gaining critical mass. As we have previously said, there is a strong correlation between homes open for sale and customer growth in subsequent quarters.", "On the broadband side, we added 214,000 net new subscribers in the fourth quarter, a 66% sequential improvement. We added a record number of new FiOS internet customers with 282,000 and we saw some sequential improvement in DSL. We ended 2008 with 2.5 million FiOS internet subscribers adding 956,000 customers during the year for an increase of 63%.", "We also saw our penetration rate increase by about 400 basis points to 25%. From a FiOS deployment perspective, we have passed 12.7 million homes as of the end of 2008 so we are a bit ahead of our planned roll out schedule of 3 million homes per year. Fiber to the home now passes about 40% of the total households in our landline footprint and 93% of the 10 million FiOS data homes open for sale can purchase the triple play, up from 80% a year ago. We will continue to expand FiOS triple play availability  as we further expand existing markets and enter new urban markets later this year.", "On the traditional access line side of the business we saw some sequential improvement in retail residential primary lines which were down 460,000. Total switched access lines declined by 911,000. We continue to see an increasing correlation between our triple play availability and line retention. In the past, we have referenced an average improvement in line retention of about 250 basis points when we look at video markets open for sale for more than six months compared with markets with no fiber to the home.", "By the end of the year we were tracking average improvements of about 400 basis points. As FiOS continues to scale and we extend triple play coverage we are optimistic that this correlation will strengthen and we see a more meaningful improvement in overall line loss trends.", "FiOS remains at the center of our consumer strategy as our broadband and video services continue to drive consumer revenue growth. Legacy consumer revenues grew by 2.9% in the fourth quarter and were up 1.7% for the full year. Broadband and video revenues totaled $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter, up 42% and totaled more than $4.2 billion for the full year. We are also seeing consistently strong growth in consumer retail ARPU which increased 14.3% from fourth quarter a year ago. About 80% of this increase is attributable to new services we have introduced within the past few years.", "Our overall FiOS ARPU continues to grow and now stands over $133 per month. The FiOS triple play ARPU is even higher.", "Now let\u2019s take a look at Verizon Business. Total revenues in the fourth quarter declined $124 million or 2.3% year-over-year. We are starting to see some revenue softness that we believe is cyclical and economy related due to a combination of delayed decision making on the part of the CIO\u2019s and lower volumes tied to rising unemployment. With the strengthening of the dollar the negative FX impact this quarter was also significant.", "As we said all along, there continues to be a shift within enterprise customer spending towards strategic services like private IP, managed services and security. Our strategic services now comprise 30% of the total Verizon Business revenues. Revenue from these services continues to grow up 8.4% in the quarter.", "Looking ahead you can expect us to continue to be disciplined and balance new sales and profitability and we are focused on increasing the range of our professional consulting services and improving our competitive position in this area. In summarizing wire line I would emphasize that we made good progress in improving our revenue mix and competitive positioning. Broadband and video services now comprise more than 31% of legacy consumer revenue. FiOS is on plan both financially and operationally and will continue to provide us great opportunity to drive customer growth and revenue growth.", "We are also very focused on continuing to improve capital and operational efficiency. In Verizon Business the continued shift to services like private IP resulted in strategic services revenue growth in excess of 16% in 2008. So we are well positioned to compete in all the strategic growth areas of the company.", "As you can see, wire line EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter fell below the 27% we experienced in the first three quarters. There were several reasons for this. First, pressure in Verizon Business as significant increases in non-farm unemployment late in the fourth quarter resulted in volume declines in higher margin services as well as lower volumes for small business customers. In addition there were some timing issues related to force reductions and organizational realignments as well as increases in bad debt, marketing and some information system contracts.", "To wrap up, from a financial perspective in 2008 we were able to continue growing revenues in the mid single digits, deliver bottom line earnings growth, generate solid cash flow growth and return value to share owners through dividend and share repurchases. We were able to arrange the necessary financing to fund the $28 billion acquisition of Alltel. All things considered, solid performance. Our balance sheet is healthy and we are in a strong financial position. Our investments are clearly paying off, driving volumes and revenues in our key strategic areas and the capital efficiency of the business continues to improve.", "In terms of net pension and other post-retirement benefits expense, we are estimating an incremental negative impact on earnings per share of between $0.09 and $0.11 in 2009. From a funding perspective, we estimate a $300 million funding requirement in 2009 for our qualified pension trust which is slightly less than last year.", "For 2009 we are targeting capital spending excluding amounts related to the Alltel acquisition to be less than the 2008 total of $17.2 billion. We have indicated that as a precautionary measure we intend to start out the year at a lower annual run rate and ramp up as we move through the year as appropriate. We expect that our ratio of CapEx to revenue will continue to improve.", "Finally, we have confidence in our ability to generate cash, invest for growth and return value to share owners.", "With that I will turn it back to you Ron.", "Ron Lataille", "Thank you Doreen. Stacy, Ivan, Denny and Doreen are now available to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", " ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays.", "Tom Sykes \u2013 Barclays", "Can you describe the economic forecast that underpins your view you will be able to grow earnings this year? I think you previously said that. Are you assuming current trends will hold throughout the year or does growing earnings require some improvement in the economy? Then, secondly we are just through the election. Can you give us some early insight into whether or not you think the more radical net neutrality proposals might start popping up?", "Ivan Seidenberg", "I don\u2019t think we have any magic economic forecast that we have looked at. Here is the theory of the case. When we look at 2008 our view is we stayed focused on our strategic innovation, capital investments and the execution on the part of Denny and his team. We obviously layer in things like the Alltel transaction and our view is, as I said earlier, we have the potential to continue to perform well absolutely and relatively. I don\u2019t think we have any specific forecast. I think Doreen will reaffirm this but the idea is visibility in 2009 is less clear than it has been in other years but the pieces here for us it is clear to focus on out performing our competitors in the market and doing more relatively.", "On the election, I think the new administration is very responsive. They have been reaching out. There is lots of dialogue. I think they recognize the most important issues they have right now are to focus on the balance in the stimulus package between tax benefits versus grant approaches to things. Stimulus spending versus tax. There are lots of meetings going on. The business roundtable is focused on this issue. We have been working with the administration. Net neutrality I haven\u2019t had anybody ask me that in the last couple of weeks. I am sure it is out there some place but even some of the players in net neutrality have already modified their position on it. I don\u2019t view that as an issue that will sort of dominate the headlines for awhile.", "Operator", "The next question comes from John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "If we could talk about margins real quick both on the wireless and wire line side. On the wireless side obviously above the long-term corporate guidance. Could you just talk about some of the drivers there and then as we look out into how the competitive environment keeps evolving is that sort of what we can expect going forward? On the wire line side obviously very different than your sort of longer term guidance. Is this the sort of level or in this range of what we could expect while the economy remains weak? It sounds like a lot of the drivers you talked about in the prepared remarks were really driven by the economy. Obviously it could be some time before things improve plus this sector is generally thought of as something of a lagging indicator. Is this sort of the right level for going forward in 2009?", "Doreen Toben", "I\u2019ll start with the wire line and wireless margins. I think as I said every time I meet with investors there can always be a quarter that can bump up over the 43-45%. Clearly if you wanted to miss you want to miss on the upside. This quarter there were some one-times having to do with vendor credits, some other systems pieces so I would look at this as more of a one-time and we will go back to the 43-45%. Nothing earth shattering that happened. A lot of moving pieces this particular quarter.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Can you maybe quantify for that or is it just a lot of little this and that\u2019s you don\u2019t want to break down?", "Doreen Toben", "Nothing was significant. I\u2019m not going to give you the vendor credit number because that is not something we disclose but it was more significant than it typically is in the Q and the rest were this and that\u2019s that added up to a number that bumped over the 45%.", "Denny Strigl", "On the wire line margin, I would make several comments on this. First of all FiOS is on plan and helping. EBITDA positive for the full year 2008. As we look at FiOS the strategic transformation has gone very well for us and of course there is always a lag in the margin when you go through a transformation like we have on FiOS. FiOS productivity is improving. On the line loss side as you have heard there is no change there. We continue to reduce force in areas that are not growing and we are in the process of consolidating our wire line, telecom and business network organization. We expect that will generate some efficiency and productivity improvements in the network planning area, engineering, the maintenance functions and we have a number of ongoing initiatives in the areas of customer self-service, process automation, flow through, back office productivity and so forth.", "Longer term, our guidance on wire line margins really hasn\u2019t changed.", "Doreen Toben", "One additional comment I would add is I did give the guidance of pension and [OPEB] between $0.09 and $0.11. You should think of that as almost exclusively as wire line which will hit obviously in 2009. So that will certainly be an impact for next year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan", "On the wireless side can you just give us a little more data? You talked about non-messaging data revenue being an opportunity but maybe comments on the impact of the economy, headcount reductions, the use of BlackBerry and also the air card business and secondly on the enterprise side can you just give us some sense of the impact of FX on the international side? It certainly looked like it rolled over pretty hard on growth rates.", "Doreen Toben", "I\u2019ll start on the FX and Denny do you want to go? The impact was the largest impact that we have seen ever to the tune of $110-120 million sequentially. We have a very sizeable international portfolio so it was in fact a very big number sequentially.", "Denny Strigl", "On the wireless question I guess the underlying question is there a slow down in wireless or what has changed in wireless. I think you need to look at a number of factors. Service revenue grew 12%. ARPU increased 1.4%. Data revenues for us continued to grow, about 41% as Doreen had said, and non-messaging revenue increased 52%. We are selling more Smart phones as Doreen mentioned in her comments, about 37% of the retail devices that have been sold. We are increasing our focus on the business segment where we have relatively lower share. Our growth drivers are clearly performing for us. We are first to report but I don\u2019t think we lost share this quarter. Our reporting ratio actually improved. We have no evidence of slowing or customers trading down either on plans or features. Our churn did tick up a bit compared to the prior year, I think you saw about 11 basis points increase on post paid churn. I can give you specifically where we see most of that.", "About 5 basis points from excess cards. That probably reflects the employment issue and the layoffs in many businesses. About 4 basis points on third and fourth line disconnects. We see no reporting evidence that they are going to other providers. I think that is economy related. I would just conclude that I think we are well positioned to compete and I think we will continue to have strong performance in our wireless company.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan", "As you look into 2009 with the boost of [metro] entering your markets is there anything you guys are going to do differently?", "Denny Strigl", "No. We are going to do nothing differently. This always comes up two or three times a year. If you look at Sprint, Boost, Leap, Metro I think as you know that is not our primary focus. Our primary focus is on the retail post pay market. That is not something that we are going after strongly and I don\u2019t see it having any impact or at least a negligible impact to date. I don\u2019t think there is any need for us to respond.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 JP Morgan", "Do you feel the same way on the wire line business from a replacement standpoint?", "Denny Strigl", "Yes. We do.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Barden - Banc of America.", "David Barden - Banc of America", "Number one, if you could just share how the Qwest relationship impacted net adds reporting in the quarter. Obviously we were expecting you guys to see an acceleration in that bringing add over to your base over the course of the year. Second, maybe Doreen on enterprise obviously incremental to the currencies can you talk a little bit about the financial sector and some of the consolidation we are seeing there and what kind of impact that might have incremental to the stand alone currency impacts we saw year-to-date?", "Denny Strigl", "Let me start with your question and frankly I don\u2019t have much to tell you there. Qwest started selling Verizon Wireless service to new customers in the fourth quarter. These are Verizon customers. It is not, I think as you know, a reseller agreement. Notification of Qwest\u2019s Spring customers will occur starting this quarter so no specifics to give you but we expect Qwest to be overall a very good distribution partner.", "Doreen Toben", "I think we saw an impact in both the financial and retail sectors in particular in LD minutes after we started to see in November and December unemployment and the job losses is where we really saw it kick in. Verizon Business is probably the hardest visibility for next year. You saw all the job announcements yesterday so trying to determine what impact that is going to have on the different sectors has been difficult. The one thing is the financial and retail is the biggest changes in to date.", "David Barden - Banc of America", "Doreen, just on CapEx you have been talking about slowing it up a little bit at the beginning of the year and trying to come in lower than last year. Is this more of a containing wire line to right size the business? Is this maybe holding off on LTE deployments to see how the year unfolds? Where are the savings going to be emerging in this business?", "Doreen Toben", "I would say it is not a containment. It is really to start out slow, see what we need to do so we don\u2019t get ahead of ourselves in putting in capacity that we don\u2019t need.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Denny I wonder if you could expand a bit on the open development initiative. You talked about 29 devices approved. Are we going to see those coming on line in the next month or two or is that somewhat longer term? Also, on the LTE if you could just update us on the timeline of what we might see in the remainder of 2009 and into 2010?", "Denny Strigl", "We are planning on the LTE piece to do our market trials later this year. So they are scheduled for 2009. We are working with our manufacturers. Very good cooperation in that regard. Commercial availability in 2010. Our goal is within the first half of 2010. On the ODI, those devices will come on line as we roll out our LTE initiatives so in conjunction with that. The 29 devices some of them are actually ready to go on our existing 3G network. I think it is positioned very well. Obviously machine to machine is the focus of our ODI and I think we have a good start in that regard.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "A delay on the digital TV shouldn\u2019t cause problems there?", "Denny Strigl", "No it shouldn\u2019t. We are trying to work through that issue but certainly later in the year had been our plan on the trials and we are trying to work through even with the DTV delay whether we could use some of that spectrum to work out the trial.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Concerning the bill as we understand it, it allows certain programmers to cut over sooner if they are ready and it gives us a chance to use that spectrum where it is available for testing and to move forward. I think the way the bill is currently constructed the potential for further delay beyond the June 12 date is probably pretty low.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "A follow-up on the wireless side, as growth in the industry slows and potentially more of the growth comes from data and upselling customers, why wouldn\u2019t margins improve above the guidance that you have had of 43-45% over time just as that marketing can be scaled across slower adds but better revenue from existing users?", "Doreen Toben", "This is sort of the age-old question and it is the same answer. We continue to balance growth and margins. So we want to make sure as the growth is available to us we don\u2019t slow down the growth enough to impact the margins. So it is really a growth in margin and we just see that as continuing to see the right balance.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "First, one more on the wireless margin outlook maybe from a different angle. 43-45% range that we have talked about, the Alltel deal synergy targets get you somewhere in the range of 150-200 basis points of margin enhancement. I guess the question is what keeps us at the 43-45% in the context of the Alltel enhancement because what it implies if you stay there is that you intend to reinvest those synergies back into the business. Then, the second question on enterprise, you have obviously flagged the pricing pressure, there is the FX headwinds. Denny you mentioned volumes slowing down. Can you give us the outlook for this business?  A lot of us look at a framework of the last cycle where enterprise was down double digits. Can you just help us think through that?", "Doreen Toben", "I guess if I start on the Alltel, I don\u2019t know that I agree that is should kick us up above 45%. There clearly is reinvestment that we are doing. If you think about the handsets that need to be replaced for Alltel to enable us to get more data revenue growth that is probably a short-term piece. I still think 43-45% is alright and will not bump us up above that on an ongoing basis.", "Denny Strigl", "On the enterprise side, let me cover just a number of things that hopefully will help here. We did see of course specifically weakness in financial services and in the retail sectors. I think we are seeing a correlation between the significant force reductions. Certainly Doreen had mentioned this and the force reductions are causing lower volumes. LD usage dropped from quarter to quarter and was at the lowest level in at least two years. We expect the layoffs and consolidations will probably continue to have an impact through 2009. Certainly as Doreen indicated the announcements you heard yesterday will have an impact.", "For our part though we are still focused on driving growth where we can and we are enhancing our long-term growth opportunities. Long-term enterprise customers we think will seek more bandwidth capabilities, add new applications, buy our managed services and we are well positioned to deliver in all of those areas. Of course we continue to manage the cost side of the business.", "I might mention here too that we continue to look for ways to partner and you will soon see a formal press release that Verizon and Accenture have reached agreement on a strategic partnership that leverages our complementary assets and capabilities. We will do joint marketing sales initiatives which will be launched first in the United States and then will extend globally as opportunities arise. Again, you can expect to see a formal press release in that regard shortly.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Denny, on the enterprise side as you think about how we could bottom out this cycle how we bottomed out last cycle, people think the positive is that you have a lot more pricing discipline this cycle than the last cycle. The negative is this cycle is a heck of a lot more broad based across enterprise. If you look at a framework of down high singles, low double digits is it better or worse this time?", "Ivan Seidenberg", "I think we all have opinions but let me just make a couple of points. First of all we have a much better industry structure than we did the last time so we are more consolidated. We are more focused. We have better products. I think we have much better products to sell into the market once the market starts to pick up. My guess is there are some positives there. You are correct, it is broader, so you have some issues on that side but this is where I think Denny has talked about productivity and costs and building partnerships. So net to me the industry is healthier this time around so I think we should bottom out differently and we should see the upside in a much better way.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Back to the enterprise front again. Can you talk about maybe what percentage of revenues are more usage base correlated there? Secondly, maybe where you think some of the pricing pressure is coming from because clearly the industry structure is a lot better than we saw last time.", "Doreen Toben", "The biggest usage base is LD and I don\u2019t have at the tip of my tongue what percentage of it is really LD to be honest. Ron has it here. He thinks it is about 20-25% so that would be the usage piece.", "The second part of your question?", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "What do you think the pricing competition is coming from? Is it driven by customers? Because it doesn\u2019t seem like you have an awful lot of competitors right now.", "Denny Strigl", "It is driven by contract renewals. So every time we see a customer, a 3 year or 4 year contract expiring, there is various competition and essentially that is where you see it. It is price take downs on renewals.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Doreen, as you do all your puts and takes it looks like your mass market revenue should turn positive here in 2009. Do you think that [access] have peaked or how are you feeling about those trends in overall mass markets if not maybe this year when do you think that turns positive?", "Doreen Toben ", "The consumer revenue is positive this quarter, right so if you take out when we have mass market we have if you will the old MCI long distance which is national so you have already seen consumer be positive this quarter. Obviously FiOS just gets better from here.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Chris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chris King \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus ", "First of all I was wondering if you had any broad commentary on the various stimulus proposals that have been flying around Washington over the course of the last couple of weeks and what you are looking for or what you would not like to see in any of those plans. Secondly, I was wondering you guys are evidently selling a Femtocell now over the course of the last couple of days. It really is just kind of a signal enhancer it appears at this point. Any kind of longer term plans for that product offering?", "Denny Strigl", "I\u2019ll take the stimulus issue. I think we are part of the process. We appreciate to give you sort of a benchmark. What we like are things like depreciation and tax policy. What we probably don\u2019t like are grants that have a lot of government conditions on them. So given those two benchmarks so far the dialogue has been pretty good and we will continue to comment on that. I think as you look at our company we have made a lot of investments in broadband and what we don\u2019t want to see is additional government regulation on any new broadband that would have any sort of backward looking impact on the company.", "Femtocell, as you know, is the secret weapon of the century. So you will I\u2019m sure after one day of sales we can tell you it is the next millennium secret weapon.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "I do think it has opened some good opportunity for us. For those of you that haven\u2019t followed this closely yet it is a signal enhancing device for both homes and businesses where we have weak signal. We just see a good opportunity here particularly as more and more customers begin to use broadband applications in the home and in business and want to be portable with those devices.", "Nothing specific to tell you at this point.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Phil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie Research.", "Phil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie Research ", "Working capital management was really good in this quarter and in particular inventories were down 16% sequentially which isn\u2019t what typically happens. Can you talk about if that was an effort by you and if you expect that to go down further going forward or how are you think about it?", "Doreen Toben", "I think one of the biggest changes we had in the quarter was set top boxes and it was a concerted effort on our part to manage that process better. That was really the biggest change to tell you the truth and we are very focused on set top box management going forward. Also to some extent handsets. We had some handsets in the third quarter that we needed to work on and move those through which we did. Those are the two biggest changes that we will continue to work on all through 2009.", "Phil Cusick \u2013 Macquarie Research ", "Do you expect that inventory to come down further going forward?", "Doreen Toben", "The absolute inventory number in the balance sheet I\u2019m not sure. Do I expect the inventory in the set top boxes to come down? Yes.", "Ron Lataille", "I\u2019d like to now turn the call back over to Ivan for some concluding remarks.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Thank you Ron. Thank you all. We are exhausted from all these questions here. We appreciate all your interest and your interest in probing the business. Just a couple of comments. We think we had a very solid quarter. We had an excellent year and we think we have built solid momentum as we head into 2009. Hopefully you think of us in 2009 as having built a solid foundation on execution, great financial discipline and innovation. We see no reason why the momentum we have developed in terms of our progress in the marketplace should not continue in some way. Like all of you we don\u2019t have perfect visibility into the economy so the level of success we have will be tempered somewhat by what the economy gives us. At this point our view is that we will continue to perform well absolutely and perform well relatively. We are looking to continue to be a formidable player in the markets we serve. As the year unfolds we will obviously have more insights to our view as we start to build a track record in 2009.", "Ron Lataille", "That concludes our call today. Once again I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us and we will see you next quarter.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect at this time.

(NYSE:VZ) Q1 2009 Earnings Call April 27, 2009  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "", "Ron Lataille - Senior Vice President Investor Relations", "John F. Killian - Chief Financial Officer", "Denny Strigl - President and Chief Operating Officer", "Analysts", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup", "David Barden - BAS-ML", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Tom Seitz - Barclays Capital", "Mike McCormack - J.P. Morgan", "Christopher King - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Operator", "", "Good morning and welcome to the Verizon first quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your conference host, Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "[Inaudible] our 2009 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. ", "I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Denny Strigl, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are on the Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website. ", "I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "Next I'd like to quickly cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings for the first quarter of 2009. In the first quarter reported earnings per diluted share were $0.58. Adjusted earnings per share before the effects of special items were $0.63. The $0.05 per share difference is due to the exclusion of certain merger integration costs and acquisition-related charges due to their nonrecurring and/or non-operational nature. These specific income statement line item effects are detailed in the reconciliation table. Merger integration costs totaled $50 million after tax or $0.02 per share. Acquisition-related charges totaled $96 million after tax or $0.03 per share. This includes transaction costs and nonrecurring finance fees associated with the bridge loan. The finance fees include upfront and duration fees amortized over the life of the loan. ", "I would also point out that the amortization expense related to customer lists is not part of the special items that we've normalized from adjusted results. This represented a little more than $0.01 of EPS in the quarter and should be about $0.05 for the full year. ", "Before turning the call over to John, I'd like to make sure that you are aware that for purposes of comparability and modeling future performance we have made available on our website historical pro forma financial and metric information for the Alltel acquisition, historical Wireline revenue under the new reporting classification, and a required financial statement presentation change due to the adoption of FAS No. 160, Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. ", "With that I will now turn the call over to John Killian.", "John F. Killian", "Thanks, Ron, and good morning to everyone. ", "Before I get into the review of first quarter's results I would like to provide a few opening comments. First, I would like to offer my congratulations and best wishes to Doreen Toben as she soon enters retirement. The CFO baton was passed to me less than two months ago, but I can tell you that I intend to build on the strong foundation she helped create. Like Doreen, I will be very focused on continuing Verizon's strong legacy of financial discipline, transparent reporting, stringent control requirements, and prudent risk management. ", "One of my first priorities as CFO was to review the business plan in detail and ensure that I can help the business achieve not only this year's financial and operating targets but also the long-term goal of sustainable value creation for shareholders. As a member of Ivan's leadership council for the last few years, I can tell you that the executive team has never been more optimistic about the outlook of the business. Everyone recognizes the current economic challenges, but we remain confident in our ability to execute and to compete well. In fact, I think our first quarter results prove this point. ", "We're also focused on improving shareholder value. As I reviewed the business plan and talked to business unit heads about their opportunities and challenges, it's clear to me that the investments in strategic changes we have made over the last several years have positioned us well for the future. It is also clear to me that we need to transition from building a competitive advantage to a model that more closely links this competitive advantage with strong and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow. ", "I understand that you as shareholders and prospective shareholders look for Verizon to be a market leader and to demonstrate financial and operational stability and strength. My goal as CFO is to enhance business performance and shareholder value. I feel strongly that Verizon's ability to grow cash flow and deliver a competitive dividend is an important vehicle for generating shareholder returns over the long term.", "As you know, it is our policy not to provide point estimate guidance on earnings and other key metrics. We believe it's more important to help investors identify the key drivers and how management thinks about growth and total shareholder returns. ", "For example, at a conference in January Ivan discussed the outlook for 2009 and highlighted some of the headwinds expected from the economy and pension plan performance. But he felt that we were well positioned in the market and despite the headwinds we could see some earnings growth this year, and we're off to a good start in the first quarter. ", "From a total shareholder returns perspective, management's goal was to provide shareholders consistent returns in the low double digits, driven by both earnings growth and a commitment to a strong and growing dividend. So as I look at current results, the business plan, capital allocation and potential M&A I will be asking: Are we creating value for shareholders and, if so, by how much? Are our actions and plans accretive to earnings and cash flow? Which areas of the business are creating value and which are not? What are the plans to improve performance in areas that are not meeting certain thresholds? And how would alternative strategic plans benefit shareholder value?", "The key drivers are obvious - revenue growth, profit margins and capital investments - and in the end how they generate returns and cash flow. Looking at our Wireless business, we'll maintain our approach of balancing growth and profitability. Alltel gives us a great opportunity and I think a very visible and achievable opportunity to drive Verizon's wireless's industry leading performance throughout the Alltel properties, improving penetration and driving free cash flow. We are also focused on achieving our synergy targets; in fact, we should realize about $1\u00a0billion in expense savings by the end of next year. ", "Verizon Wireless is a great asset, which will continue grow and generate substantial increases in free cash flow. The move to LTE over the next several years will only strengthen our position in the marketplace and establish a new platform for growth with no significant increases or bubble in CapEx. The value creation for this business is strong, with revenue continuing to grow nicely, coupled with productivity improvements producing consistent double-digit growth in free cash flow.", "In Wireline, our strategic investments have helped drive improvement in the top line, but I am also committed to driving improvement in margins over the next several years. We all know that there are secular changes impacting access lines, there are cyclical impacts on the business sector from the economy, and recently market returns will affect non-cash pension and OPEB costs. All of these issues are reflected in our current margin results; however, we still have work to do to restructure and optimize the Wireline portfolio. Our Wireline segment continues to be focused on shifting our center of gravity to the growing broadband, video and global IT markets. Our goal is to continue to improve EBITDA margins in this business. ", "We are not standing still and will not stand still. We are taking numerous actions to improve performance, including an unrelenting focus on maximizing the value of FiOS in our targeted upgrade areas. This includes focusing as much on efficiency and productivity as penetration, similar to how we manage the Wireless business - driving synergies in our newly formed Wireline network organization, which integrates the network organizations of Verizon Telecom and Verizon Business, increasing the mix of global enterprise revenue from higher margin strategic services, continuing to look at rationalizing our access line business, especially in non-FiOS areas through strategic alternatives, and lastly, continuing to resize our cost structure in all areas of the business. ", "The last area I want to touch upon is capital allocation and efficiency. We are focused on lowering the level of capital expenditures over the next several years. The key drivers here include the completion of our 18 million homes passed for FiOS, synergies from the consolidation of Wireline networks, and scale economies, network optimization and cost avoidance resulting from the acquisition of Alltel. The savings from these initiatives will more than offset Alltel integration capital requirements and the depreciation of LTE. Our 2009 first quarter CapEx results demonstrate our focus here. This will fuel our growth in free cash flow. As we pay down the debt related to Alltel over the next two to three years, debt-to-EBITDA should return to about 1.3 times level. ", "I hope this provides you with a sense of how I see the business and my assessment of how we plan to drive shareowner value. Now let's go through the details of the first quarter.", "As I said, I believe our results show that we're off to a good start. First quarter adjusted earnings were $0.63 per share, up 3.3% both sequentially and year-over-year. ", "Cash flow from operations was a very strong $6.4 billion, up 19% compared with the first quarter last year. ", "Capital spending for the quarter was $3.7 billion, which is lower than our run rate trend but consistent with our planned conservative start to the year. ", "Our strong cash flow performance, coupled with lower capital spending, resulted in $2.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter, which was $1.5 billion more than a year ago, so cash generation looks to be very healthy and our capital efficiency is certainly improving. Our network investment strategy is paying off, and I can assure you that we will continue to be disciplined in terms of how we allocate and spend capital to maximize free cash flow. ", "Net debt is obviously higher as a result of the Alltel acquisition and was $65.2 billion or about 1.8 times pro forma EBITDA for the last 12 months. Subsequent to drawing the $12.35 billion bridge loan to close the transaction in early January we issued $4.25 billion of three and five-year notes, with the proceeds being applied against the bridge facility. We also paid down a portion of the loan with VZW free cash flow. As a result, the balance on the bridge loan now stands at $5.9 billion. ", "Our cash flow outlook provides us with the financial strength to fund our capital program, reduce debt, and return value to shareholders with a very competitive dividend. ", "Turning to Slide 4, let's take a look at consolidated revenue and margins. The inclusion of Alltel increased consolidated revenues to $26.6 billion, up 12.8% compared with first quarter last year. On a pro forma basis revenue growth was 3.3% year-over-year, driven by top line increases in all strategic areas. Consolidated operating income of $4.9 billion grew 11.7% year-over-year, driven by the inclusion of Alltel. On a pro forma basis we were able to hold operating income stable in spite of the cyclical challenges in parts of the Wireline business. ", "We remain sharply focused on cost controls, with the objective of driving efficiencies to offset business volume declines. As I go through the segments, you'll see this operating and financial discipline. Let's start with Wireless. ", "In Wireless our first quarter results once again demonstrate the effectiveness of our continued focus on the retail postpaid market, the strength of our network, products and services and customer service, all of which contribute to our industry leading customer loyalty and profitability. ", "Of course, what really sets Verizon Wireless apart is its ability to generate significant cash flow. Total revenues for the quarter were $15.1 billion, up 29.6% from a year ago. On a pro forma basis total revenues were up $1.25 billion or 9%, while service revenue grew 10.5%. ", "I should point out that the properties were are required to divest are fully included in our Wireless results and will be until they are sold. ", "EBITDA topped the $6 billion mark this quarter, up 32.2% from a year ago. On a pro forma basis, EBITDA growth was 12.2%. The EBITDA margin on service revenue was 46%.", "Wireless capital spending was $1.6 billion in the first quarter, again, a bit lower than last year. And our capital efficiency continues to improve, now in the 10% range. At this point we have not done a lot of integration spending on the capital side beyond billing systems work, but this will pick up as the year progresses. ", "So our top and bottom line Wireless results continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently achieve both growth and profitability at the same time. Let's take a closer look at the drivers of Wireless revenue growth on the next slide.", "Total service revenues grew to $13.1 billion, up 10.5% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Total service ARPU had pro forma growth of 1.1% in the quarter, continuing our strong track record of year-over-year accretion. Nearly 80% of the growth in service revenue was driven by wireless data, which was up 36.8% compared with the first quarter a year ago on a pro forma basis. ", "Total data ARPU grew to $14.16, up 25% year-over-year and wireless data represented 27.9% of total service revenue in the first quarter. The main drivers of this growth continue to be e-mail, broadband access and usage, and messaging. Revenue from non-messaging data services now represents 58% of total Wireless data revenue. Non-messaging data revenues grew 47% on a pro forma basis in the first quarter. ", "PDA and smart phone sales remain strong and the good news here, of course, is that ARPU, particularly the data component, is significantly higher with these devices. We believe that wireless data, which totaled $12.2 billion on a pro forma basis in 2008 will continue to be a significant driver of revenue growth. ", "In the first quarter pro forma growth was just under $1\u00a0billion year-over-year. We see plenty of near-term upside and expect that the proliferation of new devices in the pipeline, like smart phones and netbooks, will stimulate both interest and demand for increased wireless data usage. ", "Our leadership in the deployment of LTE will incent application and device developers to create product and service capabilities that will dramatically expand the overall market potential for next-generation data technologies. As you know, we've already selected the key infrastructure partners and we intend to have a few commercially ready markets up by the end of 2009, with an objective of provide commercial service in 25 to 30 markets in 2010. ", "Our open development program is going very well and we expect the number of new devices and applications to significantly increase once we've deployed 4G. And we've announced plans to open the Verizon Wireless LTE Innovation Center later this year, which will provide an environment for testing, prototyping and trialing new LTE products and concepts. ", "Taking a look at customer results, we turned in another very strong quarter of high-quality customer growth - 1.3 million net adds, essentially all retail. Nearly 1 million net adds were postpaid and about 300,000 were prepaid. We ended the quarter with a total of 86.6 million customer, 91% of which were retail postpaid. We have 5.2 million prepaid customers and about 2.5\u00a0million customers from resellers. Retail gross adds this quarter were up 4.3% on a pro forma basis compared with first quarter last year. ", "Our total churn rate of 1.47 was up 16 basis points compared with a year ago pro forma. On the same basis, retail postpaid churn was up 15 basis points to 1.14. The reasons for the uptick are similar to what we observed last quarter - predominantly broadband access PC cards and additional line disconnects in small business. ", "Clearly, we feel very good about the competitiveness of our Wireless business. Our operating and financial performance is resulting in strong revenue growth, improving profitability and substantial cash flow generation. The Alltel integration process is going very well, with no surprises, and we are aggressively pursuing synergy opportunities. With great experience integrating wireless assets, we have confidence in our ability to execute and capitalize on the strategic benefits of this acquisition. ", "Let's move to Wireline next. In spite of the macroeconomic environment and the cyclical challenges in the business markets, I'd say that the consumer market is holding up very well and overall we've made good progress improving our competitive position. Consumer revenue is growing. Broadband and video services now comprise more than one-third of consumer revenue. Our strong operating momentum in FiOS will continue to provide us with a great opportunity to drive both customer and revenue growth. ", "In the global enterprise and wholesale markets we are seeing the cyclical effects of unemployment on business volumes, delayed decision-making on the part of some large business customers, and some negative foreign exchange currency effects. ", "The Wireline EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 25.1%. As expected higher pension and OPEB expenses contributed to the decline. ", "Let's take a closer look at revenues, starting with mass markets. Mass markets includes revenue from consumer and small-medium business, with the exception of the former MCI mass markets, which we now classify as other. ", "The majority of the revenues are in the consumer market, where FiOS, broadband and video services continue to drive revenue and ARPU growth. In the first quarter consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year. Broadband and video revenues totaled nearly $1.3 billion, representing an increase of 36.3% compared with the first quarter last year. We've also seen consistently strong growth in consumer retail ARPU, which increased to just under $70 this quarter, up 13.7% from a year ago. ", "Our FiOS customer performance continued its strong momentum, with good results in all markets, a tribute to the strength of our triple-play value proposition in a slowing economy. We had a great quarter, with sequential penetration gains of 210 basis points in TV and 190 basis points in FiOS Internet. We added 299,000 new FiOS TV customers in the quarter, ending with a total of 2.2 million subscribers and a penetration rate of 23%. So in the past 12 months we've added 1 million TV customers and expanded the availability of the FiOS triple play by almost 50%, from 6.5 million homes a year ago to 9.7 million homes open for sale at the end of March. ", "On the broadband side we added 252,000 new net subscribers in the first quarter, including a record number of 298,000 new FiOS Internet customers. We also saw some sequential improvement in DSL. ", "We ended the quarter with a total of 2.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers and a penetration rate of 27% based on 10.4 million homes open for sale. From a FiOS deployment perspective we passed an additional 500,000 homes in the quarter, which put us at 13.2 million total, still a bit ahead of schedule. And above 30% of the total households in our footprint can purchase our FiOS triple-play service today. We will continue to expand FiOS triple-play availability as we further expand existing markets and enter new urban markets later this year, like Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia. ", "On the traditional access line side of the business we saw some stability in the level of retail residential primary line losses, which were 462,000 this quarter. Total switched access lines declined by 964,000. ", "Let's turn next to the rest of the Wireline revenues, starting with global enterprise revenue. Revenue for the first quarter was $3.7 billion, down $133 million or 3.4% year-over-year, which was exaggerated by an unfavorable foreign currency translation, so the revenue decline, excluding FX, was only 1.5%. ", "Revenue from strategic services, like private IT, managed services and security, grew 7.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Strategic services are becoming a larger portion of the revenue stream. ", "We continue to take a very disciplined approach in terms of evaluating new sales and profitability, with a sharp focus on controlling our costs and improving incremental margins. We're also looking to increase our professional consulting expertise as a way to further improve the revenue mix toward higher-margin services. We continue to compete very well in terms of new contracts and we had a number of significant customer wins this quarter. ", "Moving next to our new Wireline revenue category, global wholesale, you can see that revenues were down $243 million or 9.2%. This category has several components. Special access revenues continue to grow based on increasing demands for higher bandwidth. The declining portions of this category are local wholesale, which includes the former UNEP business, switched access, where minutes are used from other carriers have declined, and long-haul transport, domestic and international, where volumes are down. ", "So in terms of our overall Wireline business, we continue to believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in both the consumer and business markets. Broadband and video revenues now comprise one-third of consumer revenue. FiOS is going very well, both operationally and financially, and will continue to provide us a great opportunity to drive growth and improve profitability. In the enterprise space, the continued shift to private IP and minutes services is creating global growth opportunities. There are clearly some cyclical pressures in the business markets, but we are focused on operating and financial discipline, driving changes in our cost structure to offset volume declines.", "So to quickly sum up and get to your questions, I'd reiterate that we're off to a great start. Our first quarter performance reflects solid execution and demonstrates both operating and financial discipline as we delivered revenue, earnings and cash flow growth in a challenging environment. Our focus on cost controls and disciplined capital spending resulted in an increase in free cash flow of $1.5 billion compared with a year ago, and I can assure you that we will continue to exercise discipline in terms of how we allocate and spend capital to maximize free cash flow. Our network investment strategy is resulting in sustained profitable growth in our key strategic areas. Our growth fundamentals in these areas remain very solid and we certainly have the potential to continue performing well throughout 2009. Our balance sheet is healthy and we are in a strong financial position. ", "And with that I'll turn it back to you, Ron.", "Ron Lataille", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik \u2013 UBS.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "[Break in audio] and about 45% for the second quarter in a row. Previously you've talked about 43% to 45% as a good range, but going forward, with a lot of the Alltel synergies still ahead of you, can we expect margins to remain above this level going forward?", "And then a second quick one. There's another article today about Verizon potentially getting access to the iPhone. Is that something that you expect to potentially happen before the conversion to LTE or just any color around that would be great, Denny.", "John F. Killian", "We're very pleased with our Wireless results in the quarter. Yes, we've had a very strong focus on both growing revenue and cash flow and margins in the business. We grew service revenue in the quarter by 10.5% and we were pleased with the 46% service margin level.", "From my perspective the EBITDA margin target of 43% to 45% that we've had out there is really no longer that helpful. As you can see, we don't manage exactly to that particular range. We came in at 46%. You are right that we do believe Alltel will give us additional opportunities in the future as we go through this year. ", "We don't think it makes sense to put out a new range, so I really would just focus on the overall performance in the quarter and you get the strong feeling here that we are very focused on both growth and profitability. ", "Denny will take the iPhone question.", "Denny Strigl", "You know, we have said in the past we're always open to discussion with any suppliers. We have no announcements to make relative to Apple today. ", "But let me say that we historically have not been dependent on any one device. We're very well positioned with high-value customers. We believe that we have currently a strong handset lineup; you'll see more from us as the year goes on. And smart phones and PDA sales overall in the quarter were very strong at 41% of our direct device sales and at the end of the first quarter we had 19.3 million integrated devices and that's in our core - the VZW base, in other words, not counting what is in Alltel - and, of course, those integrated devices are PDAs, smart phones, other devices with a keyboard and that's double what we had in the same quarter last year. ", "So, John, a bit more than what you asked for, but we're always to talking to suppliers.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins - Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup", "First, I was wondering on Wireline side if you could talk a little bit more about the wholesale business in terms of maybe what some of the factors were in the step down of revenue sequentially?", "And then secondly I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more in detail about the opportunities for you to grow margins per your comments earlier in the call on the Wireline side and maybe just give us a sense of some of the key priorities over the next 12 to 18 months as you look to execute on that goal.", "John F. Killian", "The wholesale business, yes, our revenue performance was down 9.2% in the quarter. FX did affect that. If you adjust out FX, we were down by about 7.4%. ", "There are several different pieces of this business. We continued to see growth in our special access business in the quarter. The areas of the business where we saw the decline were really twofold. One was a decline we've seen before in the local wholesale business, which is really the UNEP business, so we have a decline in UNEP lines there. We're holding in pretty good on revenue per unit in that business, which is good. ", "The second one, really, where the bigger impact was was really the carrier side of the business, which is really driven by the economy and long distance minutes in many ways. It's both a domestic and an international business. We did take some decisions, particularly on the international side, where on some of our routes we did do some price increases there. Some of that resulted in volume declines. Now to be quite candid with you, it wasn't very profitable in those particular routes and we were trying to improve the profitability there. ", "So that gives you a good sense here in terms of the wholesale business. I think Denny's going to add a comment and then we'll come back and talk about the EBITDA margin in the Wireline business.", "Denny Strigl", "Well, John, I was going to comment on margin. You're welcome to go ahead, please. I just had a couple of comments for Mike on the Wireline margin.", "John F. Killian", "So, Mike, we continue to resize the business, reducing our force in areas that are not growing. And if you look, for example, in our traditional telecom business, that is non-FiOS, the work force is down by nearly 13,000 from the end of '07 through the first quarter of this year. We are in the process of consolidating our network organizations across telecom and our business groups and we expect to generate greater efficiency and productivity improvements in network planning and engineering and in our maintenance functions. In addition to that, we look continually for new technologies and training of our force to save us time and gain efficiency.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Barden - BAS-ML.", "David Barden - BAS-ML", "Just following up on two things real quick, just on data ARPU and kind of the outlook as you see it for this year. I think we heard some comments from AT&T about drivers of slowing data ARPU, revenue growth, corporate liable subscriptions, some price downs, even some talk around the margin potentially of getting to some point of saturation in devices in the base. I think you've given us some new data there. It sounds like you guys are roughly equivalently penetrated. I wonder if you could kind of give us your thoughts about how we should think about the data ARPU trend in the current economic climate?", "And if I could, just returning to an earlier question on the Wireless margins, I know you guys don't want to give out a target, but philosophically you've got more firepower now from a margin standpoint with the Alltel merger done. Is the objective to focus on the cash flows and the growth year-over-year and bring those margins back to the stockholder or is it to kind of see what opportunities can be derived from deploying that margin back down into the lower 40% to kind of go out and mine the last units of market share out there?", "John F. Killian", "Let me just start with the second part of the question and then Denny will come back on the data ARPU. ", "You know, as you can see in the quarter, we drove to a 46% margin. We have always said our focus in this business is to drive both to growth and profitability. We're not going to limit the profitability in the business. We do have more synergies coming in. We also do believe there continues to be growth opportunities out in the marketplace.", "I said in my opening remarks we're very focused on shareowner returns. We have a very healthy dividend. And we will continue to be focused on that. ", "We're also, let me just reiterate, very pleased with the cash flow in the quarter. If you look at cash flow from ops, that was up $1\u00a0billion year-over-year. With the discipline we had on CapEx, free cash flow was up $1.5\u00a0billion. We understand the importance of that and we're not going to lose focus on that. ", "", "Denny Strigl", "", "Dave, I guess I would add in this way. As John said in his opening remarks, the data ARPU was a very solid result of $14.16, up 25% year-over-year. We believe going forward that there is more penetration to be mined in data devices. We have a very robust lineup and I think we've got some good upside, particularly with the introduction of LTE and our open development initiative later this year and into next. So I think we have good data upside.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "You talked about the strong CapEx driving free cash flow and I think up to now your guidance has been CapEx down year-over-year before the Alltel impact, but it looks like at the moment at least you're running at a pretty significant year-over-year decline. Now that you've got a little bit more visibility do you think there's an opportunity here for sort of a 10% - 15% drop in CapEx year-over-year?", "And secondly, on Alltel you talked about $1 billion in synergies by the end of '10. Can you just talk a little bit more about, again, now that you've had a better look at it, what's in Q1 in terms of synergies - roaming and stuff like that - and what should we look at for the rest of '09 to come through from that?", "John F. Killian", "I'll start with the first part on CapEx and then Denny will hit the second part of your question. ", "We were pleased with our CapEx performance in the first quarter. We had indicated to everybody that we were going to start off this year in a disciplined fashion. Coming out of the fourth quarter no one knew how bad the economy was going to be so we thought it was prudent for us to do that. So we ran at a $3.7 billion level in the first quarter. If you annualize that you're at $15 billion for the full year.", "The first quarter isn't representative of the run rate for the full year. Now that being said, we have said before that our intention this year is to bring CapEx as a percent of revenue down and we will continue to be very disciplined as we go through the year. We recognize the importance that that has on our cash flow performance. We also recognize that our business is weathering the economic situation in a very strong fashion, with good growth numbers on both sides of the business, on the FiOS side and on the Wireless side. ", "So I think you can expect some uptick from the first quarter, but again, if you look at the full year as a percent of revenue, we will be down and we are going to be very disciplined. ", "Denny Strigl", "So, Simon, then, if I may, I'll comment specifically on your point on roaming and then comment on Alltel in general.", "So not much roaming in the first quarter. We really have been focused on integration. So in that regard we have found no surprises with Alltel following the acquisition and our integration plans have remained on track. We've targeted synergies. They're visible; they're achievable. And they're in the order of over $9 billion in net present value and John and I are both comfortable with that number.", "From an operating perspective, our goal is to achieve the expense and the capital synergies as soon as we possibly can, and I think we can have a significant portion of the synergy initiatives in place by the end of this year.", "And then just a comment regarding the overall integration effort, we're preparing to convert former Alltel customers to our billing system over the next several months and you will see our store and overall signage changes made before the fourth quarter, in time for our holiday season selling. ", "The bottom line for John and I is that we're on plan and we're where we discussed June of last year and we know how to integrate acquisitions and extract synergies and we're in the process of doing just that.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Tom Seitz - Barclays Capital.", "Tom Seitz - Barclays Capital", "If I could, Denny, maybe I'll just follow up on the Alltel acquisition for a second. ", "I know you want to talk about the business as a whole, but can you give us some sort of sense as to what subscriber trends were in the Alltel legacy market? They were running at roughly about a 300,000 net add run rate and I'm wondering was that a little bit lower because you were in the middle of transforming the business to the Verizon platform, a little bit higher because everybody was excited about Verizon? Just sort of some trend there.", "And then the second question, with respect to strategic services growth you mentioned in the remarks that consulting revenue on the managed platforms is an opportunity that you're looking at. Is that a capability you can build out internally or is this an area that we might expect you to do some sort of acquisition in a bolt-on fashion to add those capabilities?", "Denny Strigl", "Tom, I will take the first part of your question. Looking at Alltel and actually looking at our overall results, as we've indicated, we're quite pleased with our Wireless net add results for the quarter. We do not comment specifically on any pieces of either our partners or properties that we've acquired.", "I would say that overall we've acquired 13.4 million Alltel customers and the Alltel properties grew during the first quarter, primarily all retail. So we feel good about what Alltel has done for us during the quarter. And, Tom, I'm going to leave it at that. ", "John F. Killian", "I'll take the second part. If you think about our enterprise business, as we've always said, it builds off the strength of the global network that we have. We believe we have the leading global IP network in place when you look at, really, the entire world, but we are focused around also building out more and more capability on the higher-margin strategic services. That includes IP; it's network services offering, our IP services. ", "On the professional services there's a couple of different areas where we have some strength. We did make an acquisition in mid-2007 of a company by the name of Cybertrust, who brought a number of professional service individuals to us with particular expertise in security but also in the IT area. Through some reorganization within the enterprise group we've added to some of those capabilities. It's actually a very good time in the marketplace to get skill sets there. And not really additive to the total force, but as we've changed out some of the force we have had the opportunity. ", "We also look here to partnerships so, you know, we announced and Denny mentioned late last year or maybe it was the first quarter the relationship with have with Accenture and we will continue to explore other kinds of partnership vehicles to get that done.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack - J.P. Morgan.", "Mike McCormack - J.P. Morgan", "On the enterprise side, can you give us, John, maybe a little more sense on the trends, maybe domestic versus international, with respect to economic impact - obviously there's an FX impact on your international side - but demand trends and economic trends between those two areas?", "And then lastly, Wireline D&A took a step back, which it sometimes does, in the first quarter of the year. Is that something we should be building off of for the rest of the year or how should we be looking at that?", "John F. Killian", "Let me give you a couple of reactions here.", "Look, the global economy is having an impact on our enterprise business both domestically and outside the United States. Currency clearly had an impact. If you look at our performance, we were down 3.4% year-over-year. If you break out the impact of FX we were down about a point and a half. So, you know, I wouldn't say, Mike, to be honest that outside the U.S. is worse than the U.S. I think we're all kind of suffering right now from the same kind of situation.", "Now related to that the very good news is our customer relationships are very much intact, so we have not lost them. That's very important for when business comes back because the big driver here clearly is employment. As you're losing jobs, it has some effect on revenue. But as that economy turns our customer relationships are very much intact. We've had no losses and we've actually picked up some new ones.", "I wouldn't read anything major into the change in the Wireline depreciation. It was up slightly but, as you know, we go through an annual review process here. Our CapEx in '08 was down from the '07 level slightly. Our fiber program, those are longer-lived assets that we're investing in. The copper network's lives have shorted over time, but the remaining life on a lot of that depreciation has also shortened down. So I think we'll run similar to how we have run the last couple of years.", "Denny Strigl", "And, John, if I could just add more color for Mike here. On the enterprise side overall, as John indicated, we're still making new sales; a number of wins in the quarter. The economy has slowed down buying decisions overall. And we're not necessarily seeing things get worse during the first quarter; I think I would classify the trends as consistent. ", "And just one more piece I would say as we have made this point in the past, we're being very disciplined on pricing. We're focused on eliminating costs and, as John has indicated, we're looking very closely at capital expenses. ", "So I think overall we're well positioned to delivery products and services when the economy starts improving. ", "Mike McCormack - J.P. Morgan", "", "I think, Denny, last quarter you guys had made mention that your nearest peer got maybe slightly more aggressive on some areas of pricing. Is that still occurring or has that sort of straightened out? ", "Denny Strigl", "I have no further comment on that at this point.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Christopher King - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc..", "Christopher King - Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Inc.", "First of all, just a follow up to Mike's question. Assuming then that the enterprise revenue decline year-over-year from an overall demand standpoint is generally usage based just in terms of lower headcount reductions worldwide by some of your customers, I just wanted to clarify that if I could.", "And then the second question relates to the hub product offering. You guys are obviously putting some more marketing muscle behind that it appears over the course of the last couple of months. I just was wondering if that was a material driver in the quarter of either Wireline churn or Wireless net adds during the first quarter?", "And then just generally speaking with respect to the hub what your feedback has been from the broader customer base with respect to that product offering? Is it trending in line with your expectations?", "John F. Killian", "Chris, on your first part of that, which was the usage component, yes, it is minutes of use, it's LD, voice minutes that we're talking about there in particular. ", "And then Denny will comment on the hub.", "Denny Strigl", "Chris, on the hub, yes, we have been aggressive in promoting the hub. It has not been material to what we've been doing in Wireless. We do tend to believe that it is of some modest assistance on churn, but frankly, Chris, it's way too early to tell.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Maybe first on just Wireless ARPU, lots of moving parts here. Can you help us get behind the numbers a bit more, maybe talk about trend rates and smart phone ARPUs versus non-smart phone ARPUs and what elements of ARPU ultimately are proving to be impacted by macro?", "And then maybe second quarter just on netbooks. You mentioned that upfront as an opportunity. A fair amount of industry buzz around this one. What do you think about sort of the economic model behind netbooks for you? Obviously, this is sort of going to test the economics of high capacity wireless data without really the ability for voice to contribute to the model so, given this, how shall we think about the subsidy model that you'll think about putting around networks?", "Denny Strigl", "Jason, if I may, I'll start here and to put your question into perspective, I would first note on the Wireless side, of course, revenues grew, as John mentioned, at 10.5%, so I would say that our Wireless business continues to perform well in a challenging environment. ", "We do see pockets of pressure due to the economy; I would say more the economy than competition related. ", "So trying to give you some perspective on the overall ARPU, we continue to see very good growth on the data side. We have no evidence of customers trading down on plans or features. Churn ticked up a bit compared to the prior year, about a 15 basis point increase on postpaid predominantly economy related. And like we said in the fourth quarter, about half of the impact is from broadband access cards, which probably reflects layoffs by many businesses, but broadband access is still growing very nicely. The economy probably has led to seeing some third, fourth, fifth-line disconnects. ", "On a pro forma basis, as John mentioned, ARPU increased 1.1%. Our data revenue continued to grow at 37%. Our non-messaging revenue increased 47%, so demand is resilient on average and we find that new customers to VZW spend more on services. In fact, on BlackBerry devices we tend to see that the ARPU is around $100. We also believe that Alltel presents us with some data upside. As you may know, Alltel's reported data ARPU was about $4 below the historical Verizon Wireless level, so we think some good upside there. ", "On netbook, frankly, we have nothing more, Jason, to add. We did say that we would introduce it later this year and as we have more information on it we certainly will let you know.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co..", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Denny first, on the wireless data front, I would assume with the PDAs and all the new netbooks coming out that you're seeing some fairly explosive growth on your wireless networks. Can you maybe talk about what that growth rate is year-over-year? ", "And I guess with non-messaging up over 50% that would translate into a lot more volume growth. Can you handle this continued rate of growth with this level of CapEx spending? ", "And then, John, maybe with the threshold that you've kind of taking here, where do you think the most opportunity to create stockholder value is with the business? Is it on the M&A front, acquisitions, divestitures, internal restructuring, or do you think it's just going to be kind of more execution on what you have at this point?", "John F. Killian", "Tim, on the first thought, our Wireless network is in a very good position. We've always prided ourselves as network being our crown jewel of our business. It's holding up very well and is a differentiator for us. So we will continue to invest along the normal lines that we have been doing from a data side. If you look at our data ARPU, we've talked about it, up very nicely. Denny mentioned the opportunity or Alltel. We think there's a great opportunity because of where they were to lift that. ", "So, you know, on stockholder value, just a couple of thoughts here for you. There's nothing more important than execution, so continuing to build and drive the business day in, day out, and we have great leaders running the different units, so we're in a very good position there. ", "We've done a lot in the last several years. If I date back, Tim, when I knew you several years ago, obviously the business has changed a lot and that was done intentionally. So our reliance on lower-growth areas of the business, we've taken care of a lot of that, particularly if you think about what we did with the directory business, some of the things we've done on the access line side. So continued strong execution in blocking and tackling; we also recognize how important free cash flow generation is, so there will be a lot of focus around free cash flow generation. ", "Ron Lataille", "[Stacy], I'd now like to turn the call over to Denny for some closing comments.", "Denny Strigl", "Okay, Ron, thank you and thank you all for joining us and thank you for your questions. ", "And let me take just the last couple of minutes here and try to wrap up. As expected, we had some headwinds this quarter, but the results reflect the combination of solid execution and the strength of our consolidated business model. The resilience in our top line growth in this challenging environment reflects both the continuous transition of our business and our focus on key growth markets. ", "We've evolved to a stronger position over the last few years by investing in our crown jewels - our Wireless network, our FiOS network and our global IP network - and at the same time we have strategically transformed the business. We divested our directories business. We monetized most of our international equity holdings. We sold some access lines and acquired assets that improved our position in the global enterprise and also the Wireless markets. ", "So if we look at the business overall, 57% of Verizon's total revenue comes from Wireless. And as John discussed, Wireless service revenues grew 10.5% in the first quarter. I would say that we're weathering the effects of the economy very well. And I believe that we also extended our industry leadership position in Wireless, in postpaid subscribers, in revenue growth and also, of course, in margin. ", "And there are significant opportunities ahead of us with Alltel, with our LTE deployment and our open development initiative, as I mentioned earlier, and we're excited about some of the handsets, software and applications that we'll be introducing later this year. All of this will help deliver solid data growth opportunities for many years to come. ", "In Wireline our strategy has been to focus on our growth markets, drive continuous cost reductions, especially in our legacy businesses, and therefore to narrow the scope of risk. We've spun off or sold some landline assets and FiOS now covers over 40% of our remaining households; that will grow to over 60% by year end. And looking at the results in the first quarter, consumer retail revenues were up 2% and broadband and video revenue grew by over 30%. Again, this was excellent performance in a challenging economy, but I believe that we can do even better, primarily by focusing on our cost structure or particularly on our cost structure. ", "On the business side, strategic services grew over 7%. We did, as John indicated, see some cyclical impacts. This market will turnaround and we have the assets and capabilities in place to capitalize on future growth.", "The other key takeaway today is the framework that John laid out in his opening remarks. We will continue to tap into new opportunities for growth, but at the same time we'll transform our cost structure and leverage our assets to grow shareowner value. John described a business model that is disciplined and focused on balancing the key drivers in growing the top line, cash flow and total shareholder returns.", "So thank you all very much for joining us on our call today.", "Ron Lataille", "Okay, that concludes our call today.

Seidenberg - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "David Barden - BAS-ML", "Phil Cusick - Macquarie Research Equities", "Chris King - Stifel Nicolaus", "Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the Verizon third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your conference host, Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2009 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning are Ivan Seidenberg, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations Web site. This call is being webcast and if you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our Web site. ", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our Web site.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our Web site.", "Next, I would like to quickly cover the difference between reported and adjusted earnings for the third quarter. In the third quarter, reported earnings per diluted share were $0.41. adjusted earnings per share, before the effects of special items, were $0.60. ", "We are excluding the following special items from adjusted results. The first item is an after-tax charge of $372.0 million, or $0.13 per share, for pension settlement losses resulting from our separation plans. Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached.", "The next item is an after-tax charge of $103.0 million, or $0.04 per share, which is for merger, integration, and acquisition costs relating to Alltel.", "We are also excluding a $41.0 million after-tax charge, or $0.02 per share, for non-operational costs incurred in connection with the spinoff of our local exchange business in 14 states. These costs are primarily related to network, software, and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.", "John F. Killian", "Good morning to everyone. Before we get into the details of the third quarter, I want to make just a few general comments. When I look at the quarter, I believe the results show good financial discipline throughout the business, which is driving excellent growth in cash flow from operations and free cash flow.", "We continue to tightly manage capital spending and while the economy continues to create headwinds for us, we are taking steps to offset the current impacts as much as possible and I am confident that as the economy gets better we will see improvements in our results. We are also taking longer-term actions to significantly reduce our cost structure to improve productivity as our business evolves.", "With that, starting on Slide 3, you can see that we produced $0.60 of adjusted earnings per share in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.86 per share. Cash flow from operations of $23.1 billion in the first nine months increased $3.2 billion, or 16% year-over-year, driven by strong cash generation in wireless. Free cash flow of $10.7 billion year-to-date was significantly higher than last year, up $3.3 billion for 45%. We have seen strong cash flow growth each quarter this year, and particularly this quarter, reflecting growth in strategic areas and our continued focus on operating and capital discipline. ", "Capital expenditures, including amounts related to our Alltel acquisition, were down $125.0 million, or 1% year-to-date, reflecting the tightness with which we are managing capital. And our capex to revenue ratio continues to improve. As you know, our board of directors approved a 3.3% dividend increase in September, which on an annual basis, increases our dividend from $1.84 to $1.90 per share. This is the third consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, for a cumulative total of 17.3%.", "These dividend increases demonstrate our board's confidence and the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet, our financial discipline, and our commitment to return cash to shareholders while continuing to invest for long-term growth.", "We also reduced debt this quarter. On a consolidated basis, net debt at the end of the third quarter was $61.6 billion, down $2.5 billion since the end of June, which is about 1.7x EBITDA for the last twelve months on a pro forma basis.", "Let's take a closer look at the revenue trends, starting on Slide 4. In spite of the challenging environment, third quarter consolidated revenues grew both sequentially and year-over-year. Similarly, last quarter, top-line results were mixed. All of our strategic areas continue to post good growth, particularly wireless data and files, but we continue to see weakness in the business markets, primarily in volume-driven voice products.", "Let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 5. Our Wireless business turned in another quarter of solid revenue growth, industry-leading profitability, and exceptionally strong cash generation. Total operating revenues for the quarter were $15.8 billion, up 24.4% from a year ago. On a pro forma basis, total operating revenue growth was 4.9% while total service revenue was up 6.1% year-over-year.", "EBITDA was $6.2 billion in the quarter, up 9.2% from last year on a pro forma basis. And our EBITDA margin on service revenue remained very strong at 46.1%. Wireless capital spending was $1.8 billion in the third quarter, bringing us to a year-to-date total of $5.1 billion. EBITDA less capex was $13.3 billion year-to-date, which is very strong cash flow performance.", "The integration of Alltel is going according to plan. Our store rebranding efforts across the country are complete. Network conversions are well underway and on track. Essentially all of the former post-paid Alltel customers have been converted to our billing system, and prepaid customers will be completely converted by the end of November.", "So another quarter of disciplined performance by our Wireless business as we continue to effectively balance both growth and profitability. ", "Let's take a closer look now at the Wireless retail market on Slide 6. Retail continues to be our primary focus and represents the largest portion of our Wireless business. 97% of our 89.0 million customer base is retail. 81.0 million, or 91%, are retail, post-paid subscribers. ", "In terms of customer growth, we continue to take a strong share of overall gross adds and maintain excellent churn metrics. Gross adds were 5.2 million in the quarter, total net adds were 1.2 million with 970,000 retail additions, 943,000 of which were retail post-paid.", "Net adds from resellers totaled 270,000 in the quarter, including one-time customer conversions from some of our reseller partners. An example would be Great Call, which announced in August that its Jitterbug cell phone would utilize the Verizon Wireless network through our open-development program.", "I would also note that we have no arrangements with resellers that provide for unlimited usage for a fixed price. My key point here is that we look for opportunities to capture share in both the retail and reseller markets on a profitable basis. But as I said earlier, our primary focus continues to be on the retail, post-paid market.", "Moving to our churn metrics, retail post-paid churn of 1.13% was up 5 basis points year-over-year and total churn was up 6 basis points, which are improvements over the past several quarterly comparisons. We continue to attribute these upticks primarily to cyclical factors that have driven business customers-related disconnects of PC cards and voice lines.", "Retail service revenue in the third quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year. Retail post-paid ARPU of $52.78 was stable with 0.2% growth compared with the third quarter of last year. We did see some year-over-year declines this quarter in air time usage in prepaid and reseller, which resulted in a 0.5% decline in retail service ARPU and a 0.8% decline in total service ARPU.", "We still believe that strong data growth will continue to offset pressures on the voice side, particularly on a retail, post-paid base. The continued introduction of new smartphone devices and increased adoption of mobile broadband should drive retail, post-paid ARPU and overall revenue growth.", "Total data revenues, as highlighted on Slide 7, topped the $4.0 billion mark this quarter, up more than $900.0 million, or nearly 29% growth. Growth in wireless data has been nothing short of remarkable. Think about this: in 2006 data revenues for the year totaled $4.0 billion. Now, less than three years later, we are generating $4.0 billion per quarter, and we are planning for continued growth, driven by increasing mobile broadband adoption in innovative new applications. Total data ARPU was up 20.7% and retail data ARPU was slightly higher, with 21.6% growth. ", "Data revenues represented just over 30% of total service revenues this quarter compared with 25% a year ago.", "Non-messaging services, which make up about 60% of total data revenue, increased 34% compared with third quarter last year. Clearly, more and more customers are taking advantage of data products and applications that leverage our extensive 3G data network capabilities. Messaging, which makes up the remaining 40% of data revenue, grew 22% versus the same quarter last year.", "PDAs and smartphone sales remained strong, once again representing about 40% of new device sales this quarter. The percentage of retail post-paid customers with these devices nearly doubled in the past year and now represent 23% of our base.", "And there is certainly upside to further penetration as we introduce more of these high-end devices, which generally require data plants. In addition, continued growth in mobile broadband devices, including new products like netbooks and MiFi devices, are also helping to expand the wireless data market.", "We also recently expanded our data pricing plans to include two new lower-cost usage-based options for customers with feature phones who may not necessarily want to pay for unlimited data. We think the new plans will be an attractive for moderate data users and will stimulate demand and expand the market.", "So looking ahead in the wireless market, we see plenty of revenue growth opportunities, driven, of course, by mobile broadband. We see several catalysts for the next phases of growth, including innovative devices, applications and content, and the much higher bandwidth and capacity of 4G technology.", "In the near term, we are very excited about our new device lineup, which we think will create demand and stimulate further broadband data usage. We also see exciting development in terms of applications and content, including the launch of our Vcast application store soon.", "Our recent announcement with Google, which leverages our network and the Android open platform, gives us a great opportunity to innovate and accelerate delivery of unique applications to customers.", "The 4G technology evolution with LTE is a huge growth opportunity for us and one that we believe we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on. We have the largest and most reliable 3G network today and we will extend our leadership position with our 4G network. We are on schedule for commercial introduction LTE next year with 25 to 30 markets, covering approximately 100.0 million POPs [points of presence] by year end.", "We expect to have nation-wide 4G coverage with LTE, featuring our contiguous, coast-to-coast 700 Mega Hertz spectrum with its unmatched capabilities for speed and network efficiency by the end of 2013.", "Let's move now to our Wireline segment on Slide 9. In the Wireline business, bios continue to gain scale and broadband and video drive growth and consumer revenue. As I mentioned earlier, business revenues have been adversely affected by the economy but we are competing well and we had several large customers wins in the enterprise market in the last few months.", "From a profitability perspective, Wireline margins continue to be pressured by both cyclical and secular effects, as well as incremental pension and OPEB costs. EBITDA declined $69.0 million sequentially, resulting in an EBITDA margin of 23.7% this quarter. We expect margins will improve over time through a combination of better revenue performance, an improving economy, ongoing workforce reductions, and other cost-saving initiatives.", "Earlier this month we announced a reorganization of our Wireline segment. We believe combining our telecom and business groups into one will enhance our effectiveness, and more significantly, reduce our costs. I will provide more details on our Wireline transformation and cost initiatives in a few minutes, but before I get to that, let's take a closer look at Wireline revenues, starting with mass markets.", "In mass markets, demand for our broadband and video products continues to drive revenue and ARPU growth. Consumer revenues in the third quarter grew 1.2% over last year, quarterly FiOS revenues totaled more than $1.4 billion, up 56% compared with the third quarter last year. Consumer ARPU also increased to just over $75.00 this quarter, up 12.6% from a year ago. And FiOS ARPU remains very strong, at more than $137.00 per month.", "Let's take a closer look at our FiOS results on Slide 11. On a year-to-date basis, we have added about 18% more FiOS TV and Internet customers than last year. This growth comes from both new markets and deeper penetration in existing markets. In the third quarter we added 191,000 FiOS TV and 198,000 FiOS Internet customers, increasing our penetration to 25% for TV and 29% for Internet.", "Although net adds were less than the record adds of the last two quarters, FiOS continues to have good momentum in the market. Churn remained low in the quarter, gross sales were lower, primarily due to a change in promotional activity.", "Overall, we are on track from a deployment standpoint, with about 45% of our premises passed. FiOS Triple-Play availability has expanded to 10.9 million homes, or about 34% of total households. And last week we announced new Quad-Play and Triple-Play bundles in several East Coast markets, so we continue to believe we can add about 1.0 million new FiOS customers each year.", "Let's turn next to the rest of our Wireline revenues, which include a global enterprise and global wholesale. In our global markets I see mixed results and a continuation of some trends that have been affecting both the retail and wholesale markets. On a positive side, we generated sequential growth of 2.5% in global enterprise revenues in the third quarter, primarily driven by continued demand for IP services. We also had a smaller impact from foreign exchange effects in the quarter. However, the cumulative effect of unemployment continues to impact usage volumes. We are also not seeing any significant change in capital or IT spending by our large customers.", "The primary leading indicator for sustained improvement in the business market will be a return to hiring on the part of our enterprise customers. We did see a pickup in CPE sales from our existing customers this quarter but not enough for me to get too optimistic. While certain volumetrics have shown some stabilization, I am still not seeing meaningful improvement. For example, enterprise business long distance voice minutes were down 4.5% year-over-year but were stable on a sequential basis. ", "So while I'm certainly not comfortable calling a bottom, I would say that I am cautiously optimistic. As I said a few minutes ago, we had several very good wins this quarter, including Jet Blue, Manulife Financial, and several government contracts. Some of these wins included integrated IT and communication solutions as well as security and consulting services. Enterprise customers are increasingly interested in managed and professional services capabilities and I believe we are well positioned in these areas.", "One last area I would like to discuss is the evolving Wireline business model. Specifically I am referring to the continuing transformation of our network, products and services, customer interfaces, capital programs, workforce, and cost structure.", "I think you are well aware of the strategic divestitures and investments we have made to accelerate growth in the consumer broadband and video market and in the global enterprise market. And you also know that these transformative moves have changed our revenue mix and driven improvement in top-line performance. But there is more to do. The investments in broadband video and global IP will also help us transform the cost structure of our business.", "For example, the FiOS platform creates an enormous opportunity for consumers to purchase innovative products and services which will drive revenue growth. But it also enables us to develop a business model with a different lower cost structure, with less reliance on a traditional copper network infrastructure. ", "The changes we recently made in our wireline organization are to simplify the business and accelerate getting bottom-line performance. We believe this is the right time to do this and we are in the process of aligning our cost structure to improve productivity.", "From a headcount prospective, as the businesses change, we have been shifting forth to the growth areas and steadily reducing our overall workforce, but we need to do more and at an accelerated pace. Our goal in the second half of 2009 is to downsize by more than 8,000 in workforce and contractors. We reduced Wireline headcount by 4,000 in the third quarter and we are on track to downsize by at least that amount in the fourth quarter. Total headcount was down 5,000 from the end of last quarter.", "Along with these force reductions, we are also looking at a comprehensive redesign of our entire call center infrastructure, including the reducing of the number of call centers and improving our utilization and efficiency metrics, and we have a Wireline network convergence initiative underway that will result in operating efficiency improvements.", "Throughout the year we have been very focused on improving our capital efficiency and operating with a great deal of financial discipline. Wireline capital spending is down by $704.0 million, or 9.6% year-to-date, and should continue to run below last year's levels.", "I mentioned earlier how tightly we were managing these costs and we will continue to do so. I am expecting that we will substantially complete our FiOS build program by the end of 2010, which alone should result in about $2.0 billion of capital savings each year. Obviously this will significantly reduce our capital requirements beginning in 2011, thus improving free cash flow and investment returns.", "I am confident that the steps we will be taking will simplify our organization, improve our ability to capitalize on new areas of growth, and achieve improved levels of productivity. ", "So to quickly sum up, we turned in another quarter of solid growth in all our strategic areas. Our cash flow growth remains strong and our balance sheet is healthy and will continue to improve over the next few years as we reduce wireless debt. We have industry-leading margins in our Wireless business, with tremendous growth opportunities ahead in mobile broadband. As I just discussed, we will continue transforming the Wireline business. ", "On the strategic front, our Alltel integration continues to go very well and our access line divestitures are on track.", "And with that, I would like to turn it back to Ron.", "Ron Lataille", "Ivan and John are now available to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik - UBS.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Could you talk a little about the wireless market in terms of the competitive pressure you're seeing? We saw some new pricing out from T-Mobile today and correspondingly, I think both Verizon and AT&T saw lower minutes of use, so if you could talk a little bit, maybe separate the data side from the voice side and what you see going forward.", "And then, Ivan, while we have you, could you just update us on where we are in terms of the access line spin, if you are seeing any potential slowdown from a regulatory standpoint in light of what we saw from FairPoint?", "John F. Killian", "I will start on the wireless side. You know, we were pleased with our quarter. When you look at net adds, 1.2 million in total, 970,000 on the retail side, we thought it was a very good performance in the third quarter. We are very excited about the opportunity ahead of us in the fourth quarter. Many of you have seen the advertising that we've had out for the launch of the Droid. ", "We announced, really today, that the Storm 2 will be available starting Wednesday. I happen to be using the Storm 2 and it's a great enhancement from where we were before. The Droid device, a number of our wireless team and Chingon are using it in pre-launch and really think it's going to be ground-breaking and have a lot of opportunity.", "We continue to see very good growth on data ARPU. Obviously we are watching all of the pricing changes. The T-Mobile changes just came out overnight. They look to be on the conservative side of what all the rumors were, in terms of what was going to happen with that pricing. We really don't see it breaking new ground, don't see, in our mind, a need to respond to that.", "I think the other point here I would make is our network, we believe, continues to differentiate ourselves and puts us in a very good position.", "Ivan G. Seidenberg", "And on the access line spins, the regulatory proceedings are moving along. There are three or four jurisdictions that are getting closer to decisions. Frontier has done a very good job at differentiating why this transaction is different than any of their previous transactions, so we are still confident that this will get closed on time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "You talked in your comments about the LTE roll out. Can you help us think about the capital spend and the potential dilution from that? What are we seeing in terms of your spending in the second half of this year and next year? Are you able to pretty much incorporate this into a sort of run rate capex and run rate margins or is there likely to be some additional pressure from that?", "John F. Killian", "From a capex perspective, we put guidance out back in September for the full year of 2009 of a range of $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion. I am sure you have already done the math and in order to hit the low end of that, we would have to spend about $5.0 billion of capex in the fourth quarter. We have been spending something like $4.3 billion, around that, per quarter, in that range.", "So at worst case, we're going to be on the very low end of the $17.4 billion to $17.8 billion. I actually think we'll do better than that and run below that for the full year.", "The LTE roll out, we are spending some capital on LTE in 2009. As you know, we're in trial mode right now. I do not see that being incremental. I see our ability to absorb that within run rates of existing capital. We have, as you look ahead to 2010, in 2009 we had more spending on Alltel integration capital. We won't have much of that in 2010 so I don't think you're really going to see any blip whatsoever from the LTE program.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Just a follow-up on some of your comments on the enterprise side of the business, and wholesale as well. Enterprise and wholesale showed upticks sequentially. Should we be surprised by that in the context of the comments that you made about still the business condition as being on the software side. And as you look at the competitive landscape, are you seeing more pricing pressure or is the pressures on revenue in the year-over-year basis more a volume issue?", "John F. Killian", "We are very pleased with where our enterprise business is. We've been saying that repeatedly over the last couple of quarters. We've had great success in the marketplace with customer relationships. We've won several new deals. We really have had virtually no defections, so the business is performing extremely well. We were pleased with the sequential growth in revenue that was up 2.5%. We are showing improvements there. I think a lot of that is driven by the success we've had with various wins in the marketplace.", "We're seeing CIOs start to be a little bit more willing to spend on new capital, new initiatives. We still see a slight drag from employment, that we think once employment really comes back in a bigger way, we will do extremely well in the enterprise space and we are very well positioned.", "Our sales funnels are very strong. The sales force, I still have personally a lot of discussions with the sales team, visit customers with them from time to time. I think we have a lot of opportunities globally in front of us, not just domestically in the U.S.", "Another point we made was we saw basically no sequential decline in LD minutes going over the network. So sequentially we saw some stabilization there. Year-on-year we were down but from that perspective. You know, pricing is about where it is. We haven't seen much of a drop on the pricing side. We've seen more stability. That's what we would expect as we go through and enter 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden - BAS-ML.", "David Barden - BAS-ML", "A couple on wireless if I could. John, with respect to the Alltel transaction and the synergies we were targeting for run rate by the end of this year and into next, could you update us with respect to your thinking on balancing how you are deploying that margin competitively in the market from a handset perspective, and should we be seeing now, even though it's a seasonally tougher market quarter, should we be looking for rising margins again in wireless as a function of that.", "And if I could, on wireline, go back to comments you made a few weeks ago about wireline. You were more conservative on wireline margins coming into the third quarter, looking for growth into fourth quarter and 2010. I'm wondering if, based on your plans, you can reiterate or clarify those expectations for wireline margin.", "John F. Killian", "A lot there in the question so let me see if I hit the items. When you take Alltel, to begin with, we are very pleased with the Alltel transaction. We are well ahead in terms of integration. We have converted all of the four area billing systems onto Verizon. Our team has done a terrific job with rebranding, capturing the roaming synergies. We said for the full year we would have $500.0 million to $600.0 million of expense synergies. We are very confident with that and think we will have a nice contribution in 2010.", "From a margin perspective, we've have three quarters in a row of 46%. We have always said we're very focused on balancing both growth and profitability and we continue to be focused there. The synergies, there are a number of moving parts in the wireless business beyond just the synergy in equipment subsidies or cost of acquisition. If you actually look at equipment subsidies, they were down, on a per unit basis, in the third quarter from the second quarter.", "Our operating team, at times, wanted to be a little more aggressive in the quarter. We intentionally held them back, recognizing that we had more of our product launches coming in the fourth quarter and we're very excited about the product launches we have coming along. ", "So we are very confident in the wireless business continuing to grow, continuing to deliver the industry-leading profitability that it has been delivering, continuing to grow cash flow, because cash flow is extremely strong in that business.", "Now on the wireline side, we are very confident that we have all of the right initiatives in place to improve margin over time. We are focused on the FiOS side, we are pleased with FiOS development, focused on continuing to drive penetration and we continue to look at all kinds of revenue opportunities in that business. We think FiOS will continue to expand opportunities to enhance revenue.", "From a cost standpoint, there isn't a line of costs that we're not focused on. As you know, we had said we would reduce the workforce, including contractors, by at least 8,000 in the second half of the year. Total business, we reduced 5,000 this quarter; the wireline side, we reduced 4,000. We are well on track for the cost-reduction efforts we have. All other areas of both SG&A\u2014real estate, procurement, cost centers\u2014we have plans in all of those areas to continue to take costs out of the equation.", "We are also watching our capital spend in that business. We think we will get some help ultimately as the economy comes back, in the enterprise and wholesale space. So we think we've got all the right initiatives to drive that margin improvement over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick - Macquarie Research Equities.", "Phil Cusick - Macquarie Research Equities", "Can we talk about your device strategy a little bit? You're integrated devices are ramping up really quickly. Where do you expect that to be as a portion of the mix next year?", "And then how do you plan to focus? Do you want to focus on, really, the differentiated devices here but you've got Palm Pre and we believe Pixie coming fairly soon. Are you just going to have a wide range and then focus on a couple that are very differentiated?", "And finally, within that, also, the sort of Android App Store, Palm App Store, versus your own application suite, how do you think about that these days? Does it even matter anymore?", "John F. Killian", "From a device perspective here, we have always said that we were going to have a wide array of product offerings in our lineup. We have continued to do that. We rolled out, in July, the BlackBerry Tour. That has done extremely well for us; we believe it will continue to do well. Storm 2 being launched this week. I mentioned on the front end here, we're working very closely on Android-based devices. ", "And I want to make the distinction that the Droid will have very different capabilities. Yes, it uses the Android open platform but the design of the set by Motorola, the browsing capability, the speed, we believe will really set those apart.", "We will be introducing the Palm early next year but our focus right now is maximizing the devices that we're launching in the fourth quarter right now.", "From an applications perspective, we will be launching the Vcast applications store later this year. We are working with over 1,000 developers on that right now. We had our open development conference. So we see a huge opportunity to generate additional data revenue, additional subscribers, from the applications work that we're doing. So we think we're in a very well, good position.", "Ivan wants to add a comment.", "Ivan G. Seidenberg", "Just to add sort of a strategic framework for this, the other way that we would ask our investors to think about this is when you deploy 4G that really pushes you to think about a broad array of devices as opposed to just the specific smart devices that we see out there now. The ones that are out now are terrific, they're getting better. So when you look at 4G and then you look at machine-to-machine, data revenue opportunity will come in so many different places that we would want to make sure that our strategy has the breadth to capture a lot of things and not to focus just on any one or two or three devices. ", "So our view is to lay the groundwork for a very broad array of data growth, which leads, obviously, to the combination of integrated applications, video, and also to sophisticated data applications.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris King - Stifel Nicolaus.", "Chris King - Stifel Nicolaus", "Two quick questions. First of all, with respect to LTE, just to follow-up on your last comment there, was wondering if there was any change, really, in the LTE handset development time line that you were looking at from your various vendors? In other words, are you guys still planning on essentially doing broadband laptop cards and the like next year over the 100.0 million POPs or so that you would plan to have done by year end?", "And secondly, it may be a little too early for this, but just wanted to see if you had an initial take on pension and OPEB costs going into 2010 and how we should begin to think about that from an earnings standpoint? ", "John F. Killian", "On LTE, in terms of devices, really no change from what we were thinking before. The initial roll out will be with laptop air cards, broadband access applications. I think we do believe as LTE begins to get more and more excitement, which we think it is and you see more and more carriers start talking about it, even on the handset side, people will start looking to move more aggressively. But that is our initial plan there.", "On pension and OPEB, it's too early to give you any kind of indication for 2010. Obviously the factors that will drive this is what's the ROA this year on our assets. We're performing well, as you would expect, through the end of September and October looks like it's going to be a pretty good month so we think that will probably be good. Discount rate will be another factor. We will have to see where that is as we end at year end.", "Our employee levels are changing and that will also be an impact here but we're not ready to provide any guidance on 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.", "Ivan, while we have you, maybe a couple of strategic questions. Can you maybe talk about where we think the initiatives going with wireline/wireless integration? Is it more important to enterprise versus consumer? ", "And I guess related to that, the second part of that is how important is having this capability on a global basis? It seems like you were emphasizing it a little bit more in the press release.", "And then third, maybe you can't comment on it too much, but on the iPhone, could you talk about if you would like to get the iPhone or not and maybe why Apple wouldn't build a cd-made version of the iPhone for the U.S.", "Ivan G. Seidenberg", "I think the way we think about what you call wireline integration is we have a chance of developing combinations of applications around the services, so rather than just a bundling of the products\u2014as you know, we've just introduced a quad-play\u2014we have other forms of products that we have in the pipeline where you would be able to use your handsets from wireless to do different things on your fixed-line network.", "So our view of this integrations is very important and I think it's important because it adds a marginal expansion of revenue growth in places where we can develop these kind of cross-integration products.", "And I think globally the reason we emphasize that is that we feel we have a really strong BlackBerry lineup and we have a lot of new devices coming out. We have lots of great capabilities in our global IP network, and as John said earlier, we feel we're well positioned in our enterprise space. ", "So I think you will see us, from a global standpoint, focus mostly our efforts there on the business market. We're doing that.", "Now in terms of the iPhone, there's nothing really different about this. I think Lowell would remind us all that this is a decision that's exclusively in Apple's court. We obviously would be interested at any point in the future they thought it would make sense for them to have us as a partner. And so we will leave it with them on that score.", "I have no further thoughts about why they may have done whatever they did. What they've done has been successful so we have to sit back and give them credit for that. But in the future, what we've done is what John said earlier, we've expanded our BlackBerry base, we've expanded our base of other devices. We now have the Droid coming out. We have an updated Storm coming out. We have application stores coming out. So I think our view is to broaden the base of choice for customers and hopefully along the way Apple, as well as others, will decide to jump on the bandwagon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Couple of questions, but maybe first back to just the wireline margin compression we've seen. Just maybe more of a hindsight-type of question. If you think about the different segments\u2014enterprise, wholesale, and consumer\u2014which segment would you say you are experiencing sort of disproportionately higher margin pressure to this point?", "And then, quickly, on FiOS symmetrics, you took up pricing in the quarter, you pulled off some other promotional activity, which had an unexpected hit to the net add trajectory, to some extent. As we look forward, is this a new run rate of net add growth that we should think about if you look to balance growth with the return profile?", "John F. Killian", "If you look at the margin compression, enterprise has held up fairly well. We've had the revenue declines but on a relative basis we knew that was coming, we were able to take costs out fairly early in the process, so enterprise has held up relatively well.", "Consumer, we've had a little bit more pressure. Now, that was expected, as you're in the middle of the FiOS roll out, you're being aggressive in terms of customer acquisition. You have some of the secular change going on, you experience a little bit more pressure on that side.", "From a wireless run rate, we indicated that we thought we had the ability to continue to grow at about 1.0 million post-paid net adds per quarter, a million net adds, and we performed well in the third quarter. We are not about to say we're going to limit the possibility of growth. We think we have a great lineup in the fourth quarter, a great lineup as we enter 2010, with LTE coming. We think there are substantial growth opportunities ahead of us.", "I mentioned earlier, we kind of kept our powder a little bit dry. We actually spent less advertising dollars in the third quarter than we had in the second quarter. Part of that was we knew that the new device lineup was coming in the fourth quarter.", "So we are still very optimistic and bullish about the ability to grow the wireless business.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. On the second part of the question, it was actually more on FiOS metrics, on the wireline side, where you had took up pricing and then pulled off some of the promotions. Just wondering if we sort of reset to a new net add profile on that side of the business.", "Ivan G. Seidenberg", "I think I would like to answer that from an operating standpoint and then if John wants to clarify further\u2014I don't think we intend to reset. What happened is that in the very beginning of the year we had targeted about a million plus and we had a couple of good quarters in a row and so we try to see how much we can continue to super charge that. As it turns out, we had a couple of promotions that worked, didn't work as well, so I don't think it's a question of are we resetting it, we've never changed our view of the million. What happened is we had a couple of better quarters and we toyed with how we could sustain that and found that it was difficult in light of maintaining a fiscal discipline against it. So the issue is we've never changed off the million plus.", "Ron Lataille", "That concludes our questions session. What I'd like to do now is hand it over to Ivan for some concluding remarks.", "Ivan G. Seidenberg", "Just a couple of quick points. I think the third quarter for us was a good balancing quarter for us to get line of sight on what we feel we need to do for the rest of this year and as we prepare ourselves for 2010. What we found is that we focused a great deal on balancing our growth against our margin performance and our net income performance and as we go forward we have better of line of sight now, in terms of what we feel that we need to do to accelerate data growth and wireless through handset deployment, applications deployment, and focus on the fundamentals in that business, to improve our net add performance as we go into next year.", "In the wireline business our view there is, as John said, we have good line of sight in where we think enterprise is and what we need to do in consumer is maintain the focus on revenue growth as it relates to FiOS and data and to balance the net add costs but at the same time pick up the pace on our efficiency initiatives, which we have a lot in place and you're seeing the benefits of some of that begin to take hold in the third and fourth quarter of this year.", "So looking out into 2010, I think our company feels that we have good line of sight in terms of what we need to do to do a better job next year than we've done this year.", "Ron Lataille", "That concludes our call today and I thank everybody for joining us.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time all participants have been placed in listen only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation.  (Operator Instructions)", "Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.  If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "Good morning and welcome to our First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.  Thanks for joining us this morning.  I\u2019m Ron Lataille and with me this morning is John Killian our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our investor relations website.  This call is being webcast.  If you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website.  ", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor Statement.  Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties.  Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC which are available on our website.  This presentation also contains certain non- GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "As we indicated on our last earnings conference call, beginning this quarter we are no longer adjusting reported earnings results.  Instead, we are only reporting GAAP earnings, consistent with trends in corporate reporting.  Of course we will continue to provide the detailed information you need to understand and analyze our reported results, including the identification of material, non-operational items.", "For the first quarter GAAP earnings were $0.14 per share.  These earnings results include a total of $0.42 of non-operational charges, the largest of which is for reduced tax benefits related to retiree healthcare.  This onetime, non-cash tax charge totaled $962 million or $0.34 per share.  In addition, we incurred a non-cash charge of $0.03 per share related to pension settlement losses resulting from our previously announced separation plan.  As you know, pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached.", "We also incurred non-operational costs in connection with the spinoff of our local exchange business in 14 states.  As we\u2019ve previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company.  This quarter these get ready costs amounted to $0.04 per share.  Lastly, we incurred $0.01 per share this quarter related to Alltel merger integration costs.", "I would also point out that all of these non-operational items are reported at the consolidated level and therefore do affect any comparison for wireless or wireline segment results to prior periods.  ", "One last item I\u2019d like to mention relates to certain revenue reclassifications within the wireline segment, due primarily to business customer shifts between mass market, global enterprise and global wholesale.  The largest shift involved businesses with 20 or more employees.  These accounts are now being managed by our enterprise sales teams and the corresponding revenues will be reported on the global enterprise line.  Revenue from businesses with less than 20 employees will continue to be included in the mass market line.", "Prior period history has been reclassified and is provided in the supplemental schedule and historical files on our website.  These changes in revenue line item reporting did not have a significant effect on historical growth rates.  With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.", "John F. Killian", "Thanks, Ron, and good morning everyone.  Before we get into the operational details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some perspective to the results for this quarter.  In January, we outlined our key focus areas for 2010.  In summary, we said that we expect to continue generating solid cash flows and maintain tight control over capital spending.  ", "Second, we would continue to capitalize on our investments in wireless, FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenues and market share, drive deeper penetration and increase ARPU.  Finally, we would remain focused on our cost structure, achieve meaningful cost reductions, and make sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in employment figures in the overall economy.  ", "In the first quarter, we executed on the business plan we described to you.  Free cash flow grew over 25% this quarter, driven by strong cash flow from operations and a lower capital spending.  We saw good customer growth in wireless and FiOS and we may be seeing some positive early signs of recovery in the business markets.", "Revenue trends this quarter were better on a consolidated basis, as well as in the wireless and wireline segments.  In wireless, data growth was particularly strong this quarter driven by the significant amount of smart phone sales and upgrades.  We feel very good about our retail postpaid ARPU and customer retention performance this quarter.", "On the cost side, we continue to benefit from the synergy savings of the Alltel acquisition and wireless margins expanded this quarter.  In our wireline segment we continue to be aggressive and persistent in our cost restructuring to preserve margins.  Cost reductions of 5,000 last quarter and 2,300 this quarter resulted in cost savings of about $80 million in the first quarter.  However, the continued economic pressures on the top line, incremental pension and retiree benefit costs, and a higher cost related to record setting storms, affecting much of our franchise territory, resulted in a lower margin.  ", "My goal continues to be to stabilize the wireline margin this year.  We are on track with our plans to accomplish this goal.  I am confident that we can achieve this objective and expand margins in the future.  Lastly, on the strategic front, our pending transactions involving the sale of the Alltel divestiture markets and the spinoff of access lines are both moving forward.  With this as an overview, let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 and start our detailed discussion of the quarter.", "As Ron indicated earlier, our first quarter earnings results included the non-operational charges you see here.  A majority being non-cash and related to deferred tax and pension expense recognition.  Our cash summary presents a much different growth picture.  Cash flow from operations in the quarter was strong, up 7.5% over last year.  Our capital spending was down $251 million or 6.8%.  Free cash flow at the end of the quarter was $3.7 billion up almost $750 million or 25.6%.  ", "In wireline, first quarter capital expenditures of $1.6 billion were down $437 million year over year.  In wireless, capital costs were higher by $219 million.  Although we\u2019ve started the year conservatively, I\u2019d reiterate that our 2010 guidance for capital spending is in the $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion range.  As far as the balance sheet is concerned, we continue to reduce leverage.  In the first 3 months we\u2019ve reduced net debt by $1.7 billion and net debt is down more than 10% from a year ago.  ", "Let\u2019s now turn to revenue trends, which are on Slide 5.  Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.9 billion, up 1.2% from the first quarter a year ago; a better growth rate than each of the last two quarters.  This reflects improvements in both wireless and wireline.  Wireless revenues were up $661 million or 4.4% driven primarily by data.  Wireline revenues were down 2.9% this quarter due primarily to continued economic pressures in our business markets.  FiOS revenue growth continues to be strong, up 40% year on year.  This is the third consecutive quarter of lower year over year revenue decline in wireline.  ", "With that snapshot of revenues, let\u2019s move to the segments next, starting with wireless on Slide 6.  In the first quarter, total service revenues were up $770 million or 5.9% versus the year ago quarter and we saw strong sequential improvement of 2.2% which is the highest sequential growth rate we\u2019ve see in the last six quarters.  ", "This revenue performance is of course driven by our strong focus on expanding the data market.  Data revenues, which comprised one-third of total service revenues in the quarter, grew 26.4% year-over-year.  Total ARPU was 18% higher than a year ago.", "In terms of the components of data growth, quarterly revenues from web and email services was $2.4 billion, up 43.5% from first quarter last year. Messaging revenues of $1.8 billion grew 16.2%.  ", "Our strategy continues to center on taking advantage of the expanding smart phone category.  Our approach has been to feature a number of different operating systems and platforms which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but aggressively upgrade existing customers to high end data capable devices.  ", "In addition to the obvious benefits to metrics like ARPU and churn, this will drive sustained data revenue growth.  We have plenty of upside in terms of data penetration.  At the end of the first quarter, more than 30% of our retail postpaid base had 3G multimedia devices or smartphones, up from 26% at the end of 2009.  17% had smartphones and 13% had 3G multimedia devices.  We believe customer demand for data mobility for connections not previously disclosed were counted in our subscriber metrics in the past.", "At the end of the first quarter we had 92.8 million customers and more than 100 million total connections.  Our high quality customer base is heavily weighted toward retail postpaid customers which comprised 89% of our subscriber base.", "This customer segment remains our key focus as we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage in penetration.  In the first quarter we added more than 1.5 million net new customers with 423,000 retail postpaid net adds and 1.3 million reseller additions.", "With regard to the change in mix, we typically see seasonal effects in the first quarter.  In any given year the sequential decline in retail postpaid net adds between fourth and first quarter can be about 25% to 30%.  This quarter the decline was magnified.  But we did not see any significant shift in market share, overall porting ratios or any increase in churn.  In fact our churn rates improved.  Total churn showed declines both on a year over year basis and sequentially.", "In postpaid, churn posted a 6% improvement compared to the first quarter last year.  I would also add that these improvements are from already remarkably low industry leading churn levels.  Although total wireless market penetration is above 90%, we are still very bullish about our growth opportunities in the retail postpaid market.", "By continuing to strengthen our smart phone device lineup, in ordering differentiated services like NFL mobile and Skype mobile, we will stimulate upgrades within our existing base as well as attract and retain high value customers.", "Net adds in our reseller channel were very strong again this quarter which is not surprising given typical prepaid seasonality.  The reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract the incremental prepaid customer.  I would also remind you that we do not have unlimited pricing arrangements with our reseller partners.", "The new category \u2013 other connections \u2013 totals 7.3 million at this time and will include all kinds of machine to machine devices like vehicle tracking, telematics, e-readers, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions, medical alert devices, essentially anything that has a wireless chip in it.", "Looking ahead, particularly when we commercialize LTE, the proliferation of these types of devices will be another source of incremental wireless growth.  As we\u2019ve mentioned in the past we have a separate organization dedicated to open development and Verizon wireless is taking a leadership role in facilitating and stimulating innovation in this area.  Examples include nPhase which is our joint venture with Qualcomm to provide advanced M2M solutions, the establishment of the Verizon Technology Innovation Center in Waltham and the creation of the 4G Venture Forum.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 8.  Our focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market.  It is the largest and most important portion of our business.  Retail service revenue -- which accounts for about 85% of total wireless revenues -- grew 5% in the first quarter on a year over year basis.", "As I mentioned earlier, our retail postpaid ARPU grew 0.6% versus the year ago quarter.  This accretion is driven by our data growth strategy with an increasing percentage of our customers using smart phones and multimedia devices.", "Device upgrades were strong as 8.6% of our postpaid base upgraded in the first quarter representing an increase of almost 15% from a year ago.  This is extremely positive from a churn and ARPU accretion perspective.", "Customers are responding very well to our portfolios, smart phones, and multimedia devices.  36% of device sales from our direct channels were smart phones with a $30 monthly data plan and 24% were from multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached.", "The pricing simplification we implemented in January is helping to drive some of these excellent metrics and the results were exactly what we anticipated.  While we experienced the downward migration of customers from the $99 unlimited price point, we also saw a healthy migration of customers up to new $69 unlimited price point.", "Another positive development is an increasing percentage of gross adds or new customers opting for voice plans at 900 minutes per month or more, which obviously bodes well for revenue and ARPU.", "As [Lowell] described on the investor call in January, our goal is to drive further smart phone penetration and stimulate data growth; which will offset some of the voice declines.  In addition, as we launch LTE later this year, having a large number of data customers provides us with a great opportunity to meet their increasing need for higher speed and more sophisticated application-based devices.", "The first quarter results indicate that this is the right strategy.  Revenue growth improved, our key customer retention metrics improved, and we saw retail postpaid ARPU accretion.", "In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating 6.4 billion of EBITDA up 5.7% from first quarter last year.  Our first quarter margin performance of 46% is a strong result, reflecting both lower retail gross additions and stronger upgrades to higher end devices.", "I think the wireless team did a great job this quarter driving this margin result given our aggressive upgrade strategy.  Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smart phones and other data devices which will further expand the data market.", "Let\u2019s move now to our wireline segment on Slide 10.  As I mentioned earlier, we continued to see both cyclical and secular pressures in our wireline consumer and business markets, with total wireline revenues down 2.9% from a year ago.", "Our broadband and video products are driving a significant shift in our consumer revenue mix and we continue to be very pleased with the success of FiOS.  FiOS revenues are up 40% and ARPU increased 5% year over year.", "Managed and IP services continue to transform the business revenue mix.  In the first quarter, strategic services revenue and enterprise was up 4.2%.  Let\u2019s take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 11.", "A year ago FiOS made up about 30% of our consumer revenue.  At the end of this quarter, FiOS represented more than 41%, a significant increase in just four quarters.  The strength of our broadband and video products continues to drive consumer revenue and ARPU growth.", "Consumer revenue in the first quarter grew 0.9% on a year over year basis and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU which increased to more than $78 this quarter, up 12.3% from a year ago.", "The entire FiOS initiative continues to be very successful and we saw very positive levels of customer additions for both FiOS TV and internet this quarter.  We have surpassed the three million customer mark in FiOS TV, with 168,000 net adds this quarter, and with 12 million homes open for sale, penetration of FiOS TV is 25%.  In FiOS internet we added 185,000 customers this quarter bringing our total to 3.6 million.  With 12.6 million homes open for sale, internet penetration is 29%.", "Let\u2019s move next to our business markets on Slide 12 which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance.  As you can see, revenue in each of these categories has been relatively stable for the last five quarters.", "As a result we\u2019re seeing improved comparisons on a year over year basis.  Global enterprise revenues was down $57 million or 1.4% in the first quarter, compared with a 4.8% year over year decline in the fourth quarter.", "The steady increase in the number of private IT site activations is an encouraging indicator, as are CPE sales, which were higher than we typically see in the first quarter. Enterprise long distance usage volumes which have typically seasonal fluctuations show year over year growth for the first time in quite a while. All of these factors point to early signs of a recovery. That should help our review performance in future quarters. ", "Global wholesale revenue in the first quarter declined $69 million but 2.9% year-over-year compared with a 4.9% decline in the fourth quarter. While we continue to see growth in ethernet services related to wireless back wall, we are not seeing a pick-up in wholesale long distance usage volumes yet. Foreign currency effects this quarter were similar to what we have experience in the fourth quarter. So the key point here is that revenue is stable and there is some optimism for improved performance in a recovery starting in the second half of the year. ", "Let\u2019s cover wireline profitability next. From my perspective we\u2019re competing well in the market and we remain focused within the wireline segment on four key strategies, driving FiOS growth, improving enterprise, driving costs out, and capital efficiency. In the first quarter, the fundamental trends underline the overall wireline results have not changed. The secular changes in the consumer market and the impact of the economic downturn in our business markets are still quite evident and while wireline revenues are still declining it is at a lower rate which is positive. ", "The facts are that in the first quarter the sequential decline in wireline revenues was nearly a quarter of a billion dollars. We did realize about $80 million in savings this quarter attributable to force reductions. However, these savings were more than offset by a combination of cost pressures including, an unusually high amount of storm related costs and incremental pension and retiree benefit expenses. I am confident that as we go through the year we will be able to stabilize the wireline margin with a combination of better revenue performance and our cost restructuring efforts. Every line item of expense is being attacked within our wireline business. ", "Let\u2019s take a look at some of the key areas. First, head counts.  In January I indicated that our plans were to reduce the wireline workforce by a similar level to what we achieved in 2009. A reduction of 10,000 people for example results in an annual run rate cost savings of about $600 million. In the first quarter we reduced our workforce by 2,300.  Keep in mind that our teams have executed well in this area with more than 28,000 reductions since the beginning of 2008.", "Next, real estate. We have been doing an extensive amount of work rationalizing our real estate portfolio to reduce costs. This included plans to close facilities and reducing square footage, reductions in energy usage as well as facility maintenance savings. Our plan identifies roughly $125 million in cost savings in 2010 alone. Over the course of the next three years we plan to reduce our total square footage by about 10%. ", "Other initiatives involve cost savings from network convergence which include center consolidations, operating and support system eliminations and new technology efficiencies. We\u2019ve identified $100 million in projected savings here by the end of 2010. Other areas of projected savings include managing third part interconnecting, content costs and a variety of reduction initiatives associated with supply chain inventory management and energy. Over the course of the next two years we have plans in place to resize our cost structure and capture run rate savings in the range of $1.5 to $2 billion. Once again we have a well organized and realistic plan and I am confident that we will capture these savings. ", "To sum up, as we move into the second quarter we remain focused on the key areas I mentioned earlier. First, continuing to generate solid cash flows and maintaining tight control over capital spending. Second, continuing to capitalize our investments and wireless FiOS and global IP networks to grow revenue in market share, drive deeper penetration and increase output. and third remaining focused on our cost structure, achieving meaningful cost reductions and making sure the business is ready to quickly benefit from improvements in the employment rates and the overall economy. ", "Ron, I will turn it back to you now for questions. ", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Ron Lataille ", "Thanks John. Brad, John is now available to take questions. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. ", "John Hodulik - UBS     ", "", "Maybe just a couple of quick questions on wireless. The growth seems to be draining out of the postpaid market in general pretty quickly. Is this a good sort of mix of net adds that we can expect between post paid and reseller going forward? And if so I know there\u2019s a lot of moving parts including some pretty some pretty strong postpaid ARPU trends but what are the margin implications here, we typically in the past talked about sort of mid 40s but given this potential shift in growth going forward, how do you see margins playing out from here? ", "Ron Lataille ", "", "Let me give you a couple of thoughts here on this. If you look at the quarter we gained 423,000 post paid customers. Typically the first quarter is down seasonally somewhere in the range of 20% to 30%. Obviously that was magnified in this quarter. We came off a very strong fourth quarter as you know where we had gained 1.1 million. Really, on the back of the strong introduction of the Droid and the Android based operating devices. ", "We had no really major new devices launched in Q1. The Android itself based operation system continues to do very well, in fact when you look at actually gross numbers we moved more of them in Q1 than we did in Q4 so we\u2019re very satisfied with what we would label as the Droid franchise and you\u2019re going to hear a lot more about that in the coming months, particularly with an important launch for us coming up shortly which is the HTC Incredible which the early reviews on is extremely positive. ", "Now the other thing in the quarter, we put a lot of emphasis around upgrades and we did see an uptick of about 15% in our upgrade level. Now that\u2019s great news for us, it\u2019s great news for ARPU, it\u2019s great news for retention and by the way we see a lot of ability with tailwinds there to continue to do well with that. ", "Now as we go forward, just a couple of thoughts for you, we believe we can do better from a post paid perspective than we did in Q1 that will be particularly on the backs of new product introductions. We are not ready to throw the towel in to say that postpaid growth is going to be substantially lower now, by the way we recognize where penetration is, we don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have $2 million quarters but we think we can do better than we did in Q1. ", "Now I would also underpin this saying we are going to be very responsible in terms of how we go after that. We are very focused on profitability, making sure we got the right mix, we do have a huge upgrade opportunity as I mentioned before, and the other thought I would give you here is that this is really a foundation as we look at it for our LTE launch later this year. We\u2019re more excited than ever about the prospects and the capability of LTE so as we get more and more of our customers with smart phone based devices it\u2019s going to be a very nice transition into the LTE launch. ", "Now a couple of thoughts for you here on margin. We had a very good quarter from a margin perspective, 46%. As you know we don\u2019t have particular point guidance out there. We have seen particularly in these economic times a bit of a mixed shift towards the all you can eat plans, that\u2019s really driven more on the lower end of the marketplace. We\u2019ve seen some of our prepaid base move to the reseller plans. We\u2019ve seen some of the lower end of the market. That will probably continue for a little while but we still believe that we\u2019ll be a lot of strength on postpaid.", "Now just to refresh you on this, our reseller pricing is not unlimited, okay? It\u2019s really a bucket of minutes.", "Reseller customers that we're attracting now carry much higher ARPUs than our traditional ones, and are very profitable and are not dilutive to our overall margin.  So we think we can continue to grow margin quite nicely in the wireless business and be in a very good position.", "Operator", " ", "Our next question comes from Tim Horan - Oppenheimer.  ", "Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "", "John, just a clarification on the postpaid ads, and then a strategic question.  Can you maybe talk a little bit about how postpaid ads progress through the quarter?  And I guess you're saying you're not really seeing shifts in market share, because I guess we're hearing Sprint and Team Mobile, Sprint particularly, is doing a little bit better with some of their new pricing moves.  But just to clarify, you're not really seeing any shifts there?", "John F. Killian", "", "Tim, on that is our market share remains strong.  We're still quite positive here.  And I'd say we're pretty even in performance as we went through the quarter.  We probably picked up a little bit towards the March timeframe.  But again just to reiterate, we believe there still is postpaid growth out there for us.  We believe our network and our offerings are a differentiator.", "Tim Horan \u2013 Oppenheimer", "", "And then just on the strategic front, there's been a lot of articles lately about Vodafone and their ownership of Verizon Wireless, and some speculation.  On how to kind of simplify that, what do you think is the most likely outcome here?  Is it maybe just status quo, find you guys the next couple of years?  ", "And related to this, there were a few articles, I think some misunderstandings on the dividends.  I got a lot of calls you might have to cut the dividend because the wire link can't support it.  Do you see any issue importing cash up from the wireless unit up to the corporate unit?  I mean I don't see what the concern is other than you have to pay some of that cash to Vodafone, but they're a shareholder like everyone else.", "John F. Killian", "", "Tim, it's a real surprise I'm getting this question by the way.  So let me give you a couple of thoughts here.  One is we've just passed the 10th year anniversary, hard to believe, of Verizon Wireless being created.  And in partnership with Vodafone, I think our teams have done a great job.  We've had a great working relationship with them over the last 10 years and the business is doing extremely well.  ", "Now let me hit the dividend issue first because I think it's important.  I want to make sure from our perspective that our shareholders understand that we view the dividend as being very safe.  We're a business that generates a lot of cash flow, over $30 billion of cash flow.  We have a lot of different levers we can pull to make sure we have the ability to pay the dividend.  ", "And you know I'm surprised that becomes as big of a question as it does become given all of the levers and all of the cash flow that we have.  We have numerous sources of cash that is being generated.  And by the way paying the dividend to our shareholders, our shareholders are a priority for us.  So the dividend and making sure we have stability and being in a position to recommend to the board dividend increases is highly, highly important to us.  ", "Now on the strategic side of it Tim, you know, over the last 10 years you and I have both watched, there are kind of cycles where the whole ownership question gets more and more attention.  We're in one of those times right now.  From where I sit, the business is working extremely well.  We've never made a secret of the fact that under the right conditions, right terms, of course we would be interested in buying out the minority interest for 45%.  Why wouldn't we be in a business that's working as well as it is?  ", "Now from my perspective as a CFO, that's very much a financial transaction.  We run the business today, we operate the business, we manage it, we control it.  So I would look at, you know, what is the price tag that the other party if they were interested in selling.  What's the price tag?  What's the multiple?  Does it make sense to us from a financial perspective?  ", "I don't know where that's going to go, but our view is pretty clear on that from that perspective.  The discussions around merger that had been out there in the press, you know, I've made a comment on that recently and it kind of does reflect the belief of the management team.  We're not convinced there's industrial logic behind putting the two organizations together.  ", "By the way, not that we're not open to listening, hearing new information on that, but we do not see a significant level of synergies, cross border mergers, you know, have not been historically highly successful.  A lot of management complexity comes with that.  So while we're always interested to hear about that, we don't really see the industrial logic.  ", "Now on the cash flow from wireless, the great news is there's a lot of cash flow.  It's growing, it's getting better.  It's going to continue to get better.  We've been clear what our view is of that in the short-term, which is to use it to delever Verizon Wireless.  That is still our view.  ", "We have an annual discussion with Vodafone in December of each year.  We'll have another next year.  There is not [religion] though. I don't want you to think that we would never dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless.  At some point when we're in a position where leverage is much lower than it is today, and when it is appropriate, we will dividend cash out of Verizon Wireless.  It's just not a 2010 event.  We'll be looking at that again as we get into 2011, but it's an event off into the future.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "A couple of FiOS questions.  There's been a lot of talk about your FiOS, sort of build plans here.  And I note that wireline Cap Ex was down about 22% year-over-year, although you reiterated your full year guidance.  Perhaps you can just clarify your build year-to-date and your build plans for the rest of the year and what's going on there.  And then on the FiOS ARPU up about 5%.  What's driving that?  Is that changes in the mix?  Is that price increases?  And where do you see that going over time?", "John F. Killian", "", "Obviously I said in the prepared remarks, we're very satisfied with where we are from a FiOS perspective.  We're very focused on growing penetration.  Our build plans, we're still on the path to build alternately to about 18 million premises within our franchise territories.  ", "This year we're going to pass about 1 million premises in 2010.  You know, give or take 100,000 or 200,000 on either side.  Part of that is an intentional strategy, Simon, this year to focus down on a lot of the inventory we have.  A very strong focus around the NPU population within our franchise territory.  ", "We don't believe we've had enough focus there, and it's a great opportunity and a very cost effective way to drive new subscribers in new retention.  Now from an RCM perspective you are right.  We've had very good growth in FiOS RCM, more focused on the video side.  We have had some price increases there which are natural, you know, in terms of the video side.  ", "We've also seen improvements in some of our Video on Demand kind of services that are also contributing to that.  So yes, we're very pleased with FiOS.  The profitability continues to improve.  We've been operating income positive the last couple of quarters.  The cost metrics that we believed we would see ultimately with FiOS has positioned us very well.  ", "And, you know, we think we've got a great foundation here on the wireline side for the future.  That, you know, we will have somewhere in the range of post Frontier spinout 70% to 80%, in that range, of footprint covered with fiber.  And that's going to position us very well for the future.  You know, we've also got focus on making sure we've got capital discipline within the wireline business.  We have suffered a little bit from the economy and some of the cyclical change.  So there is focus on making sure we're investing at the right level in that business.", "Simon Flanner \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "So just to be clear, are you going to be finished with the FiOS build at the end of this year or might some of it now.  If you're going to do 1 million a year instead of 2 million or 3 million, you're going to be a little bit more.  Still in 11, 12 --", "John F. Killian", "", "We'll have a little more to do in the 2011, and maybe even the 2012.  We're just stretching it out a little bit longer.  We felt that was appropriate given where the economy was, given some of the attention we've got around the Frontier spinout.  Don't read this at all to be at all we're not satisfied with FiOS.  We are very satisfied with FiOS and will continue to evaluate that going forward.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from David Barden \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "David Barden \u2013 Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "First would be a following up on the FiOS side, have you seen any change over the course of the quarter in the competitive dynamic in both DSL and FiOS relative to the incremental push the cable companies have been making on DOCSIS 3.0 especially on Comcast, how do you think competitively, looking into 2010 to \u201811, do you think you\u2019re stacking up now relative to cable in 2008 and \u201909?  ", "The second question would be on the iPhone, not the question you think.  It\u2019s clearer now, I think, than it\u2019s been that there\u2019s probably an iPhone refresh coming around the middle of the year.  Obviously, last year\u2019s game plan was to wait, it came, you really got more aggressive on your smart phone portfolio than you\u2019d really ever been in the third quarter and that led to a market share swing back in your favor.  Looking at it this year, what would be the game plan this year that you would do differently, if anything, to make sure that there isn\u2019t a market share swing in AT&T\u2019s favor the way we saw last year?", "John F. Killian", "From a competitive environment, from cable on video and HSI, we really see no change.  It is a very competitive environment, as you know and continues to be but I don\u2019t see anything in the quarter or this year that has really shifted.  When you look at our results, we did better in the first quarter than we did in the fourth quarter.  ", "Our total broadband was 89,000 just short of 100,000.  That was up on [30] in fourth quarter a year ago.  We continue to do reasonably well here.  We\u2019d like to drive to a little bit higher numbers as we go through the next several quarters.  We think with the economy starting to come back a little bit we\u2019re positioned for that.  Our wireline team is very focused on it.  We don\u2019t see\u2026and you know Dave, customer satisfaction and independent reports continue to put FiOS at the top of the list in all areas.  We think we\u2019ve got a great product here.  You\u2019re incenting people to change, right?  They\u2019ve already got service, typically, so that\u2019s the trick for us.", "On the second question, it\u2019s really more of what we\u2019re doing now.  We think we have found a very strong  lineup, and again, not just based on one operating system but the DROID, Android based system, the [REM] systems, we\u2019ve had some Microsoft launches recently, but you will see a lot of emphasis around the DROID as we go through the year.  We think we have a very competitive lineup.  ", "There\u2019s no question, Apple\u2019s done a great job with the iPhone, but look at our results.  We\u2019ve performed very well both from a growth, our revenue growth this quarter on the wireless side is better than it was last quarter, our service revenue is upticking .  We have several different, new devices coming as the year goes on, most notably the one I just mentioned, which is the HTC Incredible.  So, I think we\u2019ll be earlier in the process this year of having very strong devices to be very competitive.  But again, based on multiple systems, we think we\u2019ll be in a very good position.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Thinking a little bit more about what you said on the wireline and cost cutting, I think I got the numbers right, you\u2019re saying $1.5 billion to $2 billion cost cutting goal.  If you take the higher end of that on wireline revenue, I think it\u2019s a little over 400 basis points on the revenue.  Is your goal to take the margin level from 21.7 and assume pension is unchanged from here just to take that out of the equation, are you thinking that the margin over a couple year periods will get back to a 26%?  As you benchmark yourself around your competition, where do you have conviction as to where wireline margins should be for your company over time?", "John F. Killian", "Mike, let me give you a couple thoughts here.  You know we don\u2019t put out guidance numbers on that and point estimates.  Let me just give you a little color to what we think happened in the quarter, where we\u2019ll focus on and where we think we\u2019re going.  ", "If you look at the margin on the quarter at 21.7, we had to eat through a sequential revenue decline of about $225 million.  By the way, we see good news there because rate of revenue decline in the quarter was only 2.9%, it was 3.9% in the fourth quarter, so we see improvement there.  ", "We had a couple of unique issues in the quarter that hurt us a little bit.  We had mentioned that this year that we do have some incremental pension and OpEx costs.  That was about $40 million in the quarter.  We had, and this is one we don\u2019t usually like to point to and talk to, but it was such a factor in this quarter that I\u2019m going to mention it, we did have extraordinary weather conditions on the east coast.  That minimally cost us $50 million in the quarter.  That was related to a lot of overtime because of the flooding conditions and record snowfall in the Mid-Atlantic States, which you usually don\u2019t have that caused complications.  There are a lot of issues that contributed to the first quarter.", "Now when you look at our focus going forward, it\u2019s really focused around four items.  It\u2019s continuing to focus on FiOS.  We\u2019re very pleased with the profitability where FiOS is but we think it can get a lot better as we continue to get more and more scale.  So that\u2019s going to continue to ramp up and help us.", "We think our enterprise and businesses services, as the economy gets better as we go through \u201910, probably saw a little sign of that in the first quarter.  I don\u2019t think there was much of it in our numbers, but we think we\u2019ll see more of that particularly in the second half of the year.  That will be very helpful to us.  ", "Now, on the cost side, I hope you get the feel here that we are very focused on improving and continuing to improve the cost structure.  I mentioned on previous calls the last couple of years we\u2019ve reduced our wireline workforce by about 13,000 per year and I said we would do the same this year.  I actually think we have now the ability to do more than that this year.  ", "You\u2019ll probably read in the press later today that we did reach agreement with our unions and our east coast unions, the CWA and the IBEW, on an enhanced incentive offer last night.  That is going to allow us to take out a significant number of associates.  One of our limitations on our ability to downsize the workforce was we were limited in our ability to layoff in our east coast contracts.  We could layoff post 2003 hired employees and we did some of that last year, but beyond that it was voluntary incentives that drove it.  ", "We reached agreement on an enhancement and I think this year we should be able to beat the 13,000 number.  I\u2019m not going to put an exact number on that yet because we\u2019re still factoring through that based on the agreement.  But I think we\u2019ll be very focused on additional force reductions this year.", "In addition to that, Mike, we\u2019re also very focused around cash flow in the wireline business.  That ties back to some of the other questions and capital efficiency will improve.  I\u2019m not going to put a number or a date on when this is going to turn, but I am convinced we have all of the right initiatives in place.  We have the conviction to get it done and that we should see the ability to stabilize and then improve our wireline margins over time.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "If I could just ask one follow up, when you typically lose revenue, you\u2019re typically able to take some costs out of that as well.  Should we look at the cost cutting target of $1.5 billion to $2 billion as incremental to what you normally are able to take out with revenue?  So, this extra turbo boost, if you would, to the reduction in cost or does that $1.5 billion to $2 billion incorporate what you expect to save as revenue erodes for whatever period of time you\u2019re forecasting?", "John F. Killian", "Just a couple of thoughts here, Mike, I think with the news of last night, we might be able to do better than even the $2 billion.  I\u2019m not going to give you a break out of how much is tied to\u2026What I think you\u2019re going to see is improving top line within the wireline business based on FiOS and the enterprise side.  And you\u2019re going to see very visible cost reductions.  Some of that is incremental to the normal but I\u2019m not going to place an exact number on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan", "Mike McCormack \u2013 JPMorgan", "John, can you go into a little more detail about your comment about market share shift in wireless and you guys not seeing that, sort of the metrics that you\u2019re looking at there, certainly it seems like the [inaudible] marketplace is taking more and more share of growth after the market. If you\u2019re looking at purely churn then your base or just lost of gross [inaudible] overall and then secondly, in enterprise stuff it sounds like you\u2019ve got some good data plans coming from both AT&T as well you guys. Can you just give us a little more color on where you\u2019re seeing that, whether its demand for new orders, things coming through the pipeline and then sorry to bother you with the last one, in addition to the enterprise comment, how important is the enterprise recovery to your margin stability comment and why [inaudible] is it that, is it equally with cost reduction or is there one more important than the other? Thanks.", "John F. Killian", "Okay hey Mike, you know on your first one on market share, we look at really every month we get studies from Nielsen on share shifts and all of that. Obviously we look at our churn numbers which are terrific, the postpaid churn at 1.07, we look at our porting ratio, so from our view we\u2019re hanging in there very nicely, and that\u2019s at a time where there is a little slowdown as you\u2019ve mentioned on the postpaid side so we feel good about where we are on wireless market share and we think we\u2019ll continue to do well as we go through the year.", " From an enterprise perspective, a couple thoughts here for you, our number in the quarter only down, 1.4,  had been down 4.8 in fourth quarter, 6.2 in third quarter.  Even would you adjust for FX we were down 2.3 in the quarter versus 5.6 in the fourth, 5.3. So were definitely seeing improvement here from an enterprise perspective. We\u2019ve repeatedly said we\u2019ve been very successful in winning new opportunities in the marketplace. We continue to do that, a number of those are incremental. We\u2019re still seeing moves on both a private IP perspective as well as security services. We did see some benefits in the quarter also from CPE, now that\u2019s a good indicator I think of the economy, so that all puts us in a good position.", "Now on how important is it? It\u2019s important but relevantly there are four or five different major contributors that we need to get them all clicking. Cost is probably number one right now in terms of biggest contribution but continuing the progress on FiOS, continuing the progress on enterprise are all very important. ", "So I know you have another call at 9:30 so I think we\u2019re going to call this [inaudible] but I want to leave you with a couple of closing comments here.  First of all let me thank you for joining us today. If you look at our wireless business we continue to see great opportunities to grow the business and to make the business more efficient.  Our strategy around aggressive 4G deployment and increased smart phone penetration for multiple operating platforms will drive data growth and continue to differentiate us from our competitors. ", "We remain committed to maintaining reasonable growth and strong profitability in our wireless segment. On the wireline side, we believe that the strategy we put in place a few years ago, that is having a smaller footprint with the majority covered by FiOS, coupled with a more global enterprise business focused on multinationals is the right strategy that also differentiates us from our peers and will help drive growth for the long term. ", "I also recognize that the issue on the wire line segment is stabilizing and improving profitability. I do not want to overstate what we can do here in the short term but I believe our cost reduction initiatives will gain traction and with an improving economy we will see better wireline modules. Finally we continue to deliver strong cash flow metrics. Our dividend is strong and safe. We\u2019re maintaining good discipline in our capital spending and our balance sheet is solid. ", "Thanks again for joining us today on the call.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Ron Lataille, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations of Verizon.", "Ron Lataille", "Good morning and welcome to our second quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm Ron Lataille. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, the investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non- GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "On a GAAP basis, we reported a net loss for the second quarter of $0.07 per share. These quarterly results include a total of $0.65 of non-operational or one-time charges which are listed on slide four. The largest items relates to the recognition of costs in connection with our wireline force reduction initiative primarily for severance, special termination benefits and pension charges.", "These costs totaled $2.3 billion pre-tax and resulted in a charge to earnings of $0.52 per share. Roughly $1 billion of the pre-tax amount is for additional severance liabilities as a result of the enhanced incentive offer. The remaining $1.3 billion of pre-tax costs are non-cash and relate to the recognition on special termination benefits and pension plan liabilities for the effective employees.", "We also incurred non-operational costs in connection with the spin-off of our access line properties to Frontier. As we previously discussed, these costs are related to network, software and other activities required for these facilities to function as a separate company. In the second quarter, these get-ready costs amounted to $195 million pre-tax or a charge of $0.04 per share.", "Another item we've been pointing out for you is our merger integration cost related to Alltel. During the second quarter, charges related these activities amounted to $0.02 per share. In addition, the sale of the Alltel divestiture properties resulted in a one-time tax expense worth about $0.04 per share.", "The last item that I would like to highlight is a one-time non-cash adjustment of $268 million primarily related to wireless data revenues. This adjustment was recorded to properly defer previously recognized wireless data revenues that will be earned and recognized in the following period. As the amounts involved were not material to our consolidated financial statements in any current or previous reporting period, the $268 million adjustment was reported entirely in the second quarter with an unfavorable impact on consolidated revenues, which equates to $0.03 per share of earnings.", "Consistent with our reporting methodology, the items I just described are not included at the segment level primarily due to their non-operational or non-recurring nature. However, they are included in our reported consolidated results.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to John Killian.", "John Killian", "Thanks, Ron, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments on the business overall and add some of my perspective to our second quarter results.", "Our results show that we continue to do a good job executing in our key focus areas. In terms of cash generation, we had an exceptionally strong quarter of cash flow growth with continued tight controls on capital spending. We saw a good customer growth in wireless where data revenue growth continues to be driven by smartphone sales to both new and existing customers. As a result, we saw increasing year-over-year growth in postpaid ARPU and improvements to our industry-leading customer retention metrics in this quarter.", "In wireline, our EBITDA margin improvement was driven by cost reductions. During the quarter, we had approximately 11,000 volunteers for our enhanced separation offer in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. So this will go a long way toward helping us achieve our wireline force reduction objectives for the year.", "Broadband and video continue to drive revenue results within the mass markets. Revenue trends in global enterprise improved again this quarter and showed positive year-over-year growth. And while we are seeing stability in underlying trends in the enterprise space, we are still seeing cyclical effects and remain cautiously optimistic with regard to a more meaningful economic recovery.", "Lastly, we completed the pending transactions that were part of our overall strategic transformation. During the second quarter, we closed the sale of the 105 markets we were required to divest as part of the Alltel acquisition in 2009. And on July 1, we completed the access line spin-off in merger transaction with Frontier. Through the spin-off, Verizon shareholders received $1.85 per share in value in the form of Frontier shares and cash in what was effectively a stock dividend. So it was an active quarter for sure, with solid overall performance.", "Let's now move to a detailed review of the quarter, starting on slide 4. As Ron indicated earlier, our second quarter earnings results included $0.65 of non-operational or one-time charges. With a reported loss of $0.07, you can see that the math gets us to a $0.58 quarterly result.", "For the first half of the year, we produced $1.13 in EPS before the effect of non-operational or one-time items. I'd like to add a little more detail on the wireless deferred revenue adjustment. Over the last several years, we have moved away from billing customers on a per use basis for data to billing on a pre-determined price for either a bundle of text messages, a certain amount of data usage or unlimited usage of data on smartphones.", "As such, certain data services are billed in advance for services to be provided in the next monthly cycle. Essentially, we are recording an adjustment related to prior periods in which we did not properly defer a portion of monthly billed revenues primarily for certain wireless data services that are billed in advance.", "The impact to the deferred revenue adjustment in any given quarter a year was not material. So reported revenue and growth trends were not materially overstated. In fact, had we done this appropriately, the largest single year impact would have been under $80 million. However, since the amount of deferred revenue related to these types of data services had grown progressively over time, the $268 million adjustment does negatively impact consolidated revenues and our growth rates in the second quarter.", "This is a one-time adjustment to reconcile our wireless deferred data revenue balance. Given the nature of this adjustment, it is not included in our wireless segment results and does not affect prior period comparisons at the segment level.", "Let me now spend a minute on the divested properties, which will no longer be part of our results in the second half of the year. First, on the Alltel divestiture markets or trust properties, as we refer to them, these markets were sold to two different buyers, and closed on two different dates during the quarter. The first sale closed in late April and the second one in late June.", "As such, our subscriber numbers at the end of the second quarter exclude the more than 2 million subscribers that we divested in these markets. Our quarterly financial results include these properties up until the date of each sale. But since both transactions closed during the quarter, our results do not reflect a full quarter of activity for the trust properties.", "The revenue impact of not having these wireless properties for the entire second quarter is about $100 million. We divested the Frontier properties on July 1, so those results are fully included in our second quarter.", "We will be providing pro forma historical information for our wireline and wireless segments to reclassify the impact of these dispositions in late August or early September. And I'll talk more about the impacts of these divested properties on our 2010 earnings outlook at the end of my remarks.", "Since a great deal of our earnings performance involves non-cash effects, let's turn our attention now to cash flow, which presents a much different growth picture. As I said earlier, our cash flow performance was quite strong. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $9.8 billion.", "Year-to-date cash flow from operations of $16.9 billion, is up 19.4%. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $5.5 billion, up more than 75%. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow of $.2 billion is up $3.1 billion or 52%. Our operational cash flow results continue to be very strong, and we have benefited from lower net tax payments.", "Looking at capital spending in total, we were down 3.6% in the quarter, and we are running 5% below 2009 on a year-to-date basis. So at this point in time, we iterate our previously stated full year 2010 guidance of capital expenditures between $16.8 and $17.2 billion.", "And as I previously said, we are reallocating capital between our segments, reflecting growth opportunities. This shift will continue as we move through the year.", "In wireline, CapEx in the second quarter was $1.8 billion, down almost 24%. Year-to-date, wireline CapEx of $3.3 billion is down nearly $1 billion, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned, and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. In wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE network deployment and data capacity requirements.", "In the second quarter, wireless CapEx was $2.3 billion. Year-to-date we spent $4 billion, which is up $698 million or about 21%.", "Turning to the balance sheet, a top priority for us is to continue to reduce leverage. And we're doing well here with net debt of just under $53 billion at the end of the quarter, down $7.5 billion or 125% since the beginning of the year.", "Our net debt to EBITDA ratio is about 1.5 times, and we're expecting it to be even lower by the end of the year. On July 1, we transferred $250 million of debt to Frontier and shortly thereafter used the $3.1 billion of cash from the spin-off to further reduce debt.", "Let's turn now to revenue trends, which are on slide six. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $26.8 billion, an $88 million or 0.3% decline versus last year. The deferred revenue adjustment that I covered earlier had a negative impact on growth of about 100 basis points. And the timing of the Alltel trust properties sales during the quarter had an unfavorable revenue impact of about $100 million.", "During the quarter, we saw revenue growth in our key areas, including wireless data, FiOS, strategic services within the global enterprise market.", "With that high-level snapshot of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with wireless on slide seven. In wireless, we had another strong quarter, with sequential improvement in revenue, ARPU, churn and profitability. Our revenue growth performance was strong with total service revenues up $697 million or 5.2% year-over-year. And when we look at our results without the Alltel trust properties, in other words on a pro forma basis, total service revenue growth was 6.2%.", "Our focus on expanding the data market drove data revenue growth of 23.8% compared with last year. Total data revenues grew to $4.8 billion this quarter and comprised 34.5% of total service revenues. And total data ARPU grew 16.1% year-over-year.", "Our strategy is focused on continuing to take advantage of the rapidly growing smartphone device category. Our approach is to support a number of different operating systems and platforms and to offer a robust line-up of devices, which gives us the opportunity to not only attract new customers, but upgrade our existing customers.", "In addition to improving ARPU and customer retention, we believe this approach will drive sustained data revenue growth. And we continue to be very bullish about this opportunity. For starters, we see a plenty of upside in terms of data penetration.", "At the end of the second quarter, 35% of our retail postpaid base had smartphones or multimedia devices, up from just under 31% at the end of the first quarter and 26% at yearend. 20% of our postpaid customers have smartphones and 15% have multimedia devices.", "The DROID franchise has been a great success. We have a steady stream of devices featuring the Android operating system since the first DROID was introduced last fall. To date, we have six devices with multiple manufacturers in our current device line-up with more to come.", "The Incredible was introduced late in the second quarter, and we began selling the new DROID X on July 15. Both devices have sold very well and customer feedback has been terrific. We have had some backorder issues, but this is more timing than anything else.", "Customer demand and interest in the smartphone category has never been greater. Demand is being driven by the proliferation of new devices with greater capabilities in innovative applications and content. We feel really good about our device portfolio with great momentum going forward.", "Looking ahead, particularly with the commercial launch of LTE later this year, we believe that our network advantage will become even more evident and differentiate us more than ever before.", "Let's now talk about our customer growth results. We displayed our customer activity on slide eight. So you can clearly differentiate the second quarter net add growth from the effectively Alltel trust properties subscriber adjustments.", "We had a good quarter in terms of growth, adding 1.4 million net new customers with 665,000 retail postpaid net adds and 896,000 reseller additions. In the postpaid market, we competed very well this quarter with a strong device line-up. Our increased focus on customer retention drove an excellent sequential improvement in postpaid churn of 13 basis points.", "Our net add performance in the reseller channel was also very good, especially since the second quarter is typically seasonally lower in this customer category. As we've said, the reseller market is a low-cost channel for us and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended this quarter with 92.1 million customers, which as you know is substantially retail postpaid, representing 89% of total customers.", "And as we identified beginning last quarter, the other connections category is where we will be including all kinds of machine-to-machine devices such as vehicle tracking, telematics, e-readers, consumer electronics, smart grid solutions and medical alert devices.", "Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on slide nine. Our key focus continues to be on the retail postpaid market where we continue to drive revenue growth through increased data usage and penetration. Retail service revenues grew 4.2% in the quarter. Retail post paid ARPU increased 1.2% compared with the year ago, effectively doubling the year-over-year accretion we saw in the first quarter. This accretion is driven by data plans and the increasing percentage of customers using smartphones and multimedia devices.", "Device upgrades were strong once again, with about 9% of our post paid customers upgrading in the second quarter. Customers continue to respond very well to our portfolio of smartphones and multimedia devices. About 40% of device sales from our direct channels were smartphones with a $30 monthly data plan and 17% were from multimedia devices, which have a minimum $10 monthly data plan attached.", "Our strategy of stimulating data revenue growth is also improving customers retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. The improvements were most notable in retail post paid with churn under 1% and improving seven basis points year-over-year.", "In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA up 7.8% from a year ago. Our second quarter service EBITDA margins expanded to 47.5% driven by strong data revenues, churn improvements and the continued benefit of Alltel synergy savings.", "Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail post paid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will further expand the data market.", "Let's move to our wireline segment on slide eleven. On the consumer side, broadband and video products continued to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew more than 33% year-over-year and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $145 is up 7% over second quarter last year.", "On the enterprise side, growth in strategic services, which includes security IP and other managed solutions continue to transform the revenue mix. In wholesale, revenues were impacted by secular pressures and the effect of international pricing changes. Let's take a closer look at both the consumer and business markets starting on slide twelve.", "This time last year, FiOS made up about one-third of consumer revenue. FiOS revenues now represent more than 43%. Within consumer, the strength of our broadband and video products together with our increasing sale should continue to drive positive revenue and ARPU growth and offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business.", "Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 0.3% versus last year, and we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to more than $80 this quarter up 11.4% from a year ago. In terms of customer growth we saw a sequential improvement in net additions in both FiOS TV and internet. At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 3.2 million FiOS TV customers adding 174,000 this quarter compared with 168,000 in the first quarter. Our FiOS TV penetration is 26% based on about 12.4 million homes open for sale.", "On the broadband side, we added 196,000 new FiOS internet customers this quarter compared to 185,000 in the first quarter, bringing our total to 3.8 million. And with about 12.9 million homes open for sale, FiOS internet penetration is 30%. Adding a high speed internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with 9.3 million broadband connections.", "Let's move next to our business markets on slide thirteen, which shows our global enterprise and global wholesale revenue performance. While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macro economic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global enterprise revenue showed positive sequential in year-over-year growth up 1.1% versus first quarter and 0.6% versus second quarter last year.", "Our revenue performance was helped by strong CPE sales in network and solutions based services. Strategic services, which represent about 40% of global enterprise revenue grew 6.2% year-over-year and 3.5% sequentially. I'd say we are seeing some signs of stabilization, we're still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any meaningful change.", "In global wholesale revenue declines were worst than trend, down 8.3% year-over-year and just under 5% sequentially. Domestically, revenues continued to be impacted by secular pressures. Internationally we made a decision to increase voice pricing in certain routes, which resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market.", "Let's cover wireline profitability next.", "In the second quarter, we were able to improve the EBITDA margins by about 100 basis points sequentially to 22.7%. The improvement was primarily driven by wage related savings and third party interconnection costs in the quarter. We're making good progress in our workforce reduction initiative. Wireline headcount was down 3,800 in the second quarter and 6,100 year-to-date.", "As I mentioned earlier, we had approximately 11,000 acceptances our enhanced incentive offer in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. About two-thirds of these employees went off-payroll in late June or early July, with the remainder leaving the business later in the third and fourth quarter, as we carefully manage the transition with a focus on customer service. The benefits of these actions should help our margins in the third and fourth quarters.", "We are also considering additional force reductions in other locations within the telecom business. We should know more about this by the end of the third quarter.", "As far as our other cost reduction initiatives, we're also making progress in real estate, network convergence, supply chain, inventory management and energy. We have a well organized and realistic plan, and I'm confident that we will capture these savings. We'll also continue to be very disciplined in terms of our capital spending.", "To sum up, we had a solid quarter with exceptionally strong cash flow. We will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. Our wireless results were solid. And in wireline, our cost reduction initiatives resulted in margin improvement. And we successfully completed our pending transactions by closing the sale of the Alltel trust markets during the quarter and divesting the access line properties to Frontier on July 1.", "The Frontier transaction culminates a strategic transformation that we've undergone since the inception of Verizon 10 years ago. During this process, we have aligned our company with the major growth trends driving our industry. We have simplified the business by divesting our directories business, monetizing our international equity investments and spinning off certain access line properties. We have restructured through strategic acquisitions and investments, significantly increased our exposure to the growth areas of the future, wireless, broadband and global connectivity.", "In wireless, we've increased our scale through acquisitions, purchased the valuable spectrum and invested in new technologies that will position us to capture growth in the rapidly evolving mobile broadband space.", "We've changed our revenue mix in wireline, reinventing our technology base with fiber and expanding our global presence through acquisition to meet the growing demand of enterprise customers for the global connectivity.", "In short, we've positioned ourselves to be a stronger competitor in areas of higher growth and minimized our exposure to areas of the business that are more challenged by secular change.", "The revenue pie on slide 16 highlights our current revenue mix. The first observation is that 83% of our consolidated revenues come from wireless and global business customers. Secondly, the wireline mass market business comprises only about 16% of our current revenues, with the majority of our households covered by FiOS.", "So the net result of the strategic investments and divestitures that we've made is an outstanding set of high-value assets with greater potential for revenue growth.", "We are also confident that over the long term, we can grow profit and shareholder returns. In the short term, I realize that the impact in timing of these divestitures make estimating 2010 earnings more difficult. So in addition to providing pro form historical information soon, I would like to offer investors some thoughts about the impacts of these divestitures in my outlook for the second half of the year.", "Before non-operational and one-time items, we had $1.13 of earnings per share in the first half of the year. The assets we spun off to Frontier and the Alltel trust properties accounted for approximately $0.12 of first half earnings. So excluding these properties, we had $1.01 of earnings per share. Our goal is to grow earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from this first half adjusted base of $1.01.", "In the second half of this year, we expect a continuation of the trends we're experiencing in our wireless business. We believe we can continue to grow the business in terms of net adds and drive higher smartphone adoption, leading to accelerating ARPU accretion and revenue growth.", "In addition, we will continue to make great progress managing costs. You saw the strong service EBITDA margin that we delivered in the first half, and we expect to continue this performance.", "In our wireline business, although we don't expect any significant economic driven improvements in the second half, we will continue to accelerate the success in the cost reduction programs you saw in the first half. Virtually all of the benefit associated with our incentive offer to associates will be reflected in our second half results. In addition, we continue to make great progress in other areas such as reducing our overall access costs and delivering on all of our other cost reduction initiatives.", "So again, a good quarter. We are optimistic about the outlook for the second half of the year and we are confident in the long-term potential of the business.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Ron so we can get to your questions.", "Ron Lataille", "Thank you, John. Brad, if you could open up the lines for questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John Hodulik - UBS.", "I guess, John, first maybe a follow-up to some of the guarantees you just gave. So I'm doing the math right; it would sort of suggest that on a non-pro forma basis, you are talking in the 220 to 226 range for 2010 and on a pro forma basis more like 208, 209 to 214. These are sort of quick numbers. But I guess given the 5% to 10% range, is that sort of in the ballpark.", "John Killian", "If you take, John, the first half earnings of the $1.13 and then I indicated that you strip out the impact, so if you look at the Frontier contribution, that's in the range of $0.08 to $0.09 in the first half of the year. Trust properties are in the range of $0.03 to $0.04. Combined, it's about 12. So if you strip that away, it's $1.01. What we are saying is we will grow 5% to 10% off of the $1.01.", "John Hodulik - UBS.", "So $1.06 to $1.11 and that you add that back to the $1.14.", "John Killian", "You're doing the math and you can make it work. And add that to the $1.13 in the first half of the year, and you'll get to a range.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "I guess my real question is around margins. On the wireline side, you had some nice performance in the quarter. You went through some of the issues there. I know you don't have pro forma out yet for the deal. But given the progress you've made on the cost saving side, are we still expecting about 200 basis point decline in margins on a sequential basis or does some of the cost savings continue to kick in and maybe sort of offset some of that impact on the second half?", "John Killian", "We will be putting pro forma result out, as we've mentioned, late August early September. The initial impact as you strip out Frontier is around a couple of hundred basis points. Now, as we've said on the call and we've said on past calls, within the wireline business, we are extremely focused on driving costs out of that business. We had very strong performance in the second quarter.", "I had indicated on the first quarter call that we thought that was the case. Force benefits, sequentially we had some wage-related savings principally on the over-time side. We did not see any of the benefit really in the quarter from the 11,000 force reduction that we've got with the associate offer.", "So most of the individuals who went off in the second quarter were late in the quarter. We had some more in early July. That was a little over 7,000 of the 11,000 went off there. We should see those benefits in the second half of the year.", "So we believe we can improve wireline margin in the second half of the year off of the pro forma wireline margin that we'll be putting out, and we feel good about those initiatives. Every cost line is being attacked in the wireline business; our third-party access cost, our telco cost, our big area of focus, obviously all the headcount items are a strong area of focus.", "We are seeing improvements in real estate expense. We have vacated some buildings. Most recently, we terminated the lease in Philadelphia on 1717, Arch Street which was a fairly sizeable commitment for us.", "So we think we have a lot of opportunity to drive cost reduction on the wireline side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of JPMorgan.", "Mike McCormack - JPMorgan", "Congratulations, Ron as much as I might be selfish, I hope to hear you in October as well. John, on the wireless margin side, can you just give us some sense on what the drivers are for cost reduction? Obviously a very strong net add quarter, gross adds pretty flat sequentially.", "Looks like a pretty good take-down in SG&A. Is there some part of that that come out with divested property, and what should we be thinking about for a good run rate there? And then secondly, with the Vodafone issue looming at some point maybe next year or 2012, wireline CapEx, looks like it's down year-to-date about $1 billion year-over-year.", "How far can we get that down over the next year or so?", "John Lataille", "Okay, Mike, couple of thoughts for you. Clearly, I think you can see from the call that our wireless business is really firing on all cylinders. And we think there is substantial opportunity ahead of us to continue that performance. We are in the early innings of wireless data with only 20% of our base having a smartphone, and then with LTE a whole set of opportunities around video.", "So we think there's a lot of opportunity to accelerate top-line performance as we go through the second half of the year and into 2011.", "Now, couple of thoughts for you. The wireless team is extremely focused on all areas of cost. If you look actually at the headcount, they are down year-on-year about 8,000 people. Now a couple of thousand of those are related to the trust properties. There's a little bit of other ones in terms of leave of absence, those kinds of things. But net-net, we're down 4,000 to 5,000 people.", "They have a series of initiatives within the wireless business that's focused on their distribution side of the business. That's driving more efficiency, more online transactions. Again, an area where we think we are very early in the process of driving that out.", "Another area that they have a lot of attention is all of the cost and expenses around managing supply chain inventory levels and just the whole process there. So, you know, just about every area of the wireless side. Again, like wireline, they are attacking the underlying cost structure.", "We are very pleased with the margin performance in the second quarter, and think we are in a good position to continue to drive both growth and profitability in that business.", "Mike McCormack - JPMorgan", "Okay. And on the wireline CapEx?", "John Lataille", "On the wireline CapEx, we indicated Mike, our guidance was 16.8 to 17.2 for the full year on CapEx. You can see in the last two quarters, we have had a big shift where more of our spending is going to wireless than wireline. So we are taking wireline down this year.", "I expect that trend to continue as we go into 2011. I think we can take another fight out of it down next year. I'm not going to size that right now, because we're early in the process. But I think our overall CapEx spending, as we look at 2011 will be down from where we are today, although we will keep a pretty strong allocation to the wireless side.", "As you know, the wireless side being fueled by LTE and by data.", "Mike McCormack - JPMorgan", "John, your comments on the wireless SG&A side, it sounds like the bias would be towards flat to down on SG&A for the balance of the year.", "John Lataille", "Very focused on driving more and more cost out the wireline side on SG&A; absolutely. And on the back of the 11,000 volunteers we had on our East Associate offer, I should mention that we are going to do some additional offers in the rest of Verizon in the second half of the year in our, what used to be the West, which is really California, Texas, and Florida. So we would expect to get some additional force reductions from that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "On the dividend outlook, you've always had some strong cash flow performance. You've got a positive outlook for the second half of the year. But on the other hand you also distributed a dividend, effectively with Frontier with a lot of cash generation. So how should we think about your upcoming decision in September around continuing that annual dividend increase, or are there some sort of one-time factors this year?", "And then we've had AT&T with tier data pricing. You've got a lot of smartphone load now. LTE is coming up. What are your current thoughts on tiered data pricing?", "John Killian", "So, Simon, just a couple of thoughts for you. Yes, cash flow is tremendously strong, better in the quarter than even we expected. The team has a tremendous amount of effort and attention there.", "It's driven principally from operating performance. A part of that was, I hope you noticed, the working capital benefits, because the operating team is very focused on managing inventory levels and all of your days sales outstanding, all of the components that drive cash flow in the business. And I think we're performing extremely well here.", "So on the dividend side, as you know, that's a Board decision. The Board will consider that in September. I think we put them in a position where they have some pretty good alternatives there from the dividend perspective given the cash flow performance. But at the end of the day, that will be their decision.", "On pricing, we're performing extremely well right now. If you look at our data revenues this quarter, they're up about 24% year-on-year. If you look at data ARPU for our postpaid base, they're up over 19%. Again, as I said to you earlier, a lot of upside potential there given where we are on smartphones and multimedia devices in the future.", "We have indicated in the past, as we move to an LTE world and LTE pricing, we will probably look very hard at tiered pricing, and that continues to be our thinking right now. So more to come on that.", "By the way, I should say that all of our assets, all of our plans on getting LTE launched in the fourth quarter are on schedule. We feel very good about that. We think that's going to open up the whole new set of opportunities to continue to grow this wireless business that is again performing very well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.", "David Barden - Bank of America", "John, first, could you talk a little bit about the one part of the wireless that seemed to be maybe a little on the soft side, which was the retail prepaid? It seems like you guys have kind of transferred the economics of being a retail prepaid provider in wireless over to your wholesale relationship with TracFone. That relationship has been on for a year now.", "I was wondering if you could kind of talk to us about your takeaways and some of the experiments you're doing with the $50 unlimited plan in the Southeast.", "John Killian", "Dave, overall from a growth perspective in wireless, I'm very satisfied, 1.4 million net adds. On the last quarter call, a lot of people were suggesting that the postpaid market was coming to its end. And we thought there was still a lot of life there for Verizon and we did a lot better in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. So we feel very good about our position in the postpaid marketplace. That is our prime strategy.", "The device lineup [roll] and his team have done a tremendous job with the device lineup. The whole DROID franchise is performing extremely well. We introduced the Incredible, as you know, in the second quarter. We just launched the DROID X. There's more devices to come. So we think our handset lineup is very well positioned.", "Now we've also suggested that we decided to play more of the prepaid marketplace, not exclusively. We have our own prepaid offerings that have benefits in terms of handsets and customer service, but that we were playing more of that end of the market through the reseller opportunity. By the way, not just the Straight Talk offering. There is several different resellers, and we've been very satisfied with that.", "I mean it's fueled some nice growth for us as we've gone through the past year. The ARPU levels run significantly higher than the traditional reseller offerings we have had. The profitability from the tiered margin percentage basis is pretty good, because you don't have the marketing cost and a lot of the SG&A. So we think that strategy has worked well for us, and we're continuing to do that. There's always some seasonal fluctuation there from a reseller model.", "Now, on the prepaid offering that you said, it's just a trial in the South. It's targeted to a specific geographic area. There's not a plan at the moment to bring that nationally. From time-to-time, our e-readers do different things to see what kind of reactions, kind of experiments, and that's what that is all about, nothing more than that.", "David Barden - Bank of America", "If I can just follow-up on the tiered pricing also, obviously you had a good quarter in postpaid. The new iPhone and the pricing changes came out at the end of second quarter. Now that you've had some time to assess the market and what the tiered pricing plan has been for AT&T versus you guys now without it, how compelling an offer do you feel it is, how competitively imperative is it that you do something along those lines? Or is it mostly just a capacity management.", "John Killian", "It's very early days since that change went in. What I would tell you is our business continues to reform extremely well. Our smartphone lineup is being very well received. Our DROID lineup, we have been keeping the DROIDs in stock, by the way. We don't have a big supply problem here. There's a little bit of a delay in fulfillment, but we're in a good position there.", "So our business is continuing to perform extremely well, you haven't seen us rush out to make any kind of a change. We'll continue to monitor the situation of course and look at opportunities that will say what's the best equation for us to drive long term shareholder value and we'll be very focused on that.", "I can't say enough though about the opportunity we see ahead given where we are today with smartphone penetration. I mean I think 20% of our base today, where's that number going, ultimately is it 80%.", "Some people could argue everyone is going to have a smartphone ultimately, because that's the kind of device that's going to be. So I think there is tremendous opportunity to continue to drive and create value through Verizon wireless.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "Just wanted to follow on the cost side, I think it was the last call. Started to decide the opportunity for cost cutting over the next two year and if I remember correctly, it was the comment was at least $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Based on the efforts you've made in the second quarter, can you give us an update in terms of the size of the opportunity and what percent of that you think you can realize in 2010 versus 2011?", "John Killian", "So, Mike, I'm not going to resize the number for you. What I would tell you is, is our confidence on the ability to drive cost out of the entire business, both wireline and in the wireless business too, has never been stronger. I mean I think we've come off a quarter where we've had very good performance.", "If you look at our business year-over-year, we're down about 24,000 people in total from an absolute basis, a big chunk of those coming out in the first half of this year, more coming out in the second half of the year. By the way we also transferred a little over 9,000 people with the Frontier transaction that we just completed.", "So I think we're in a very good position. The organization knows how important it is to resize the cost structure. So we feel very confident about our ability to do that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Maybe a couple of questions, first on enterprise trends, the results seem to indicate share shift in your favor. I'm wondering, you obviously talked about the macro, but can you talk about what you're saying in the competitive marketplace?", "And then maybe second question just on wireless ARPU, good progress on post paid ARPU growth, accelerating the rate of growth as you moved up to 1.2%. But with the device refresh you got going on, it seems like we have a lot more upside. So I'm just wondering if you could talk about the trajectory from here and we can see at least one tier in the industry approach 4% growth, do you think that's realistic for you?", "John Killian", "Okay. Jason, a couple of thoughts for you, I mean yes. Enterprise we had better performance this quarter on a reported basis we were up which was very good. Now we had a couple of things that helped us there, we had a very strong CPE quarter. A lot of demand for equipment out there, which is good, I mean it drives some margin. We are doing some pricing change on the CPE lineup.", "We did a late second quarter early third quarter to drive a little bit of margin that might temper down the volume just a little bit as we go through the third quarter.", "When you underlie and strip out CPE and some of the other things, we did see improved performance in enterprise although it was still a little bit negative year-over-year. I wouldn't say we're seeing any big change from and economic standpoint at this point. I think you're hearing that from every call that's out there right now as maybe in the first quarter there was a little bit of an uptick with everything going on in Europe and other issues that's probably been a little bit of a pause in terms of purchase decisions.", "Right now we're hoping that will pick back up in the second half of the year, but from up here enterprise perspective, we were pleased with our performance in the quarter, but we have a little bit of caution as we go through the rest of the year in, again why it's so important to drive more and more cost out of the business, but at the same time very focused on driving more profitability in enterprise.", "In fact, as I look at our deals we signed in the second quarter versus the first quarter, margin was up about 250 basis point on those deals quarter-to-quarter. So I think that was a very good sign.", "From a wireless post paid ARPU, we think there is upside as we go through the next couple of years. our smartphone line up if you think about it over the last year we solved the problem with the DROID franchise where we were a little bit behind in terms of the smartphone lineup that is paying dividends for us right now.", "We expect those dividends to accelerate, that our lineup is going to do extremely well. I would love to see 3% to 4%, I think we will get better. I think the other company that you indicated, they do have a higher concentration of smartphones in their customer base than we do today. But that gap is going to close, because we've got great devices, great lineup and of course our distribution is a machine quarter-after-quarter.", "So I think you're going to see improving performance there. And it just comes back to the issue I said earlier is we believe there is tremendous opportunity to continue drive shareholder value in this business field principally on the wireless side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "First of all, I just want to congratulate Ron on the great opportunity and wish you well. Just want to go back quickly here to wireless margins. You gave a lot of color earlier about what you're doing particularly on the cost management side. You come in there I think at an all-time record this quarter in terms of EBITDA margin. And I just want to get a bit more color on what the ultimate goal here is.", "The cost savings initiative, is that designed to help you guys sustain what is a margin level that may be 200 to 300 basis point higher than normally people would have expected? Or are you really just trying to create capacity so that you can keep your foot on the gas in terms of driving data in terms of incurring the subsidies that you would get from higher smartphone sales and maybe the higher costs you're actually going to incur from running the LTE network?", "John Killian", "I think from a wireless perspective, we've always been a very balanced company in terms of not just looking at top-line, not just looking at growth, really looking at all the levers to drive shareholder value. We still are in the same place. Since I've been on this job, I've said I think there is opportunity to continue to grow the wireless business very nicely. And we think growth is going to accelerate. We think there is not going to be a deceleration in growth. There is actually going to be a next wave fueled by data and video where growth is going to get better.", "But at the same time, we have the opportunity to take costs out of the model and become a more efficient provider. And Lowell and his team are extremely focused on that. So I like our position here from the wireless perspective and where we have the ability to go.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "You're doing a great job in smartphones. You're a little bit over half of your sales in your direct channel now or smartphones or other integrated devices. But based on your lineup, you can easily see that at 70% or 80% and notch it just in future. You're probably going to be incurring some additional costs as you get ramped on LTE.", "I am just trying to set expectations here in that should we assume that at some point that might create a little bit of incremental pressure on the margins or do you really feel comfortable the way you've done from the cost management side and kind of keep things in a range even as you ramp in those areas?", "John Killian", "I feel very comfortable that we can both grow the top-line of the business and just continue to deliver the industry-leading profitability that we have delivered. There is no question there is going to be a higher take-up of smartphones and multimedia devices, but we're very well positioned for that. There is also a nice return from that, because they are higher ARPU-based customers. So I don't think anyone's network, anyone's distribution is better positioned to take advantage and drive it to the bottom-line than we are. And we're very focused on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "John, sort of beating the dead horse here, but one of your major competitors, when they started rolling out smartphones, they saw the margins getting depressed quite a bit. You're not seeing that now, and it sounds like you don't expect to see that. Is it because the DROID maybe has a lot lower subsidy than the DROID lineup than some of the other high-end smartphones are our there?", "And on that point, it sounds like you're saying that you're not going to see any supply chain problems with the DROID lineup in the second half of the year. Could you maybe just comment on that? And then just lastly, can you give us a bit of a regulatory update? Are you guys talking to the SEC about ways to avoid the Title II regulation discussions that are ongoing?", "John Killian", "Because smartphone devices cost you more money, COGS is up. It's a nice trade-off here. And if you look at our machine in terms of what we built over time, we have the ability to manage that and absorb that and still drive good margins. And we believe we can.", "Now, if we had one quarter where we had 3 million DROID net adds, there is probably going to be a little bit of an impact, but I would take that impact because of what it's going to do ultimately for value and shareholder value. So we're focused, as we've always said, both on growth and profitability. We will continue to be focused on that.", "We are taking costs out of our supply chain process and we will continue to do that. We're managing inventory levels extremely tightly, which is appropriate.", "From a supply chain perspective on supply of smartphones, we need to manage through it, which we are. These are kind of global issues with certain devices, but we're in a good position here. We think we can fulfill the requirements we have as we go through the second half of the year. We're working extremely closely with all of our manufacturers, and we think we're extremely well positioned.", "The other comment I'd make, Tim, on the Washington front, yes, we're actively engaged, including Ivan and Tom Tauke and Randy Milch on all of the issues, both with the policymakers as well as other industry participants. We'll continue to watch this, and we're optimistic that this will come out in the right place for us and for the industry. But time will tell on that. So not a lot more that I could comment on there right now.", "We did complete the Frontier transaction. I know you're all anxious for pro forma. We'll get that out to you. But as we look back on that, that was a very, very good transaction for us and for Verizon.", "When we first announced the deal, there were about 4.8 million lines in those territories. As you know, we had a fixed value effectively. The value per line was about $1,791. By the time we completed the transaction, it was about $22,140 per line.", "So we're very satisfied with what we've done with the Frontier transaction. We think we've gotten very good value here for the Verizon shareholder, both in terms of the value they get in Frontier and the debt relief. So it's a transaction we're very pleased with. And our team I think did an outstanding job working with Frontier on all of the transition.", "I would also like to just publicly acknowledge Ron on this call. Many of you did that. He's done a terrific job for us over the last several years. We will be announcing his replacement shortly in August, and I think it will be a top-notch individual. And of course, that individual will have the guidance of Ron on what needs to be done here. So, Ron, I'd just like to thank you, and I know from the industry you'll be getting a lot of thanks.", "Ron Lataille", "Thank you very much, John. And, Brad, that concludes our call today, and thanks everybody for joining us.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference for today.

(NYSE:VZ) Q3 2010 Earnings Call October 22, 2010  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "John Doherty - SVP, IR", "John Killian - CFO", "Fran Shammo - EVP and President, Verizon Telecom and Business", "Analysts", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "David Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Chris Larsen - Piper Jaffray", "James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the Verizon third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions)", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon", "John Doherty", "Good morning and welcome to our third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is John Killian, our Chief Financial Officer; and Fran Shammo, who will be assuming the CFO role on November 1.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial statements, investor quarterly publication and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "As I'm sure you are aware, we published reclassified historical financial information for the past six quarters for the results associated with the Frontier transaction, as well as the divested wireless trust properties. In addition, we reclassified prior period wireless results for the deferred revenue adjustment that we recognized in the second quarter of 2010.", "The financial and operating metrics included in our slides are therefore presented on a comparable basis. However, on the balance sheets and segments of cash flows, prior periods were not reclassified for the impact of the divested properties. On a GAAP basis, we reported earning of $0.31 per share in the third quarter.", "These quarterly results include a total of $0.25 of non-operational charges, which are listed on Slide 4. The largest item is a non-cash charge of $0.19 per share relating to the recognition of pension settlement losses resulting from our workforce reduction and separation plans.", "Pension accounting rules require that settlement losses be recorded, once prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. In connection with the closing of the Frontier spin-off, we also incurred a charge of $0.04 per share for certain non-operational and transaction related costs.", "The last item is merger integration costs related to Alltel. During the third quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.02 per share.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to John Killian.", "John Killian", "Thanks, John, and good morning everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some comments on our overall performance and add some of my perspective to our third quarter results.", "The business is performing extremely well. We had another solid quarter, and we continue to execute well on our key focus areas. We had strong earnings performance in the quarter, showing sequential improvement.", "On our last conference call, I stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.10 per share. Our third quarter results indicate that we are on track to meet this goal, and expect to be at the high end of this guidance.", "Wireless had a very good quarter, with accelerating revenue growth driven by strong postpaid ARPU accretion. New customer additions and device upgrades once again resulted in higher smartphone sales and drove data revenue increases. And we sustained our wireless EBITDA margin of 47.2%, which remains by far the highest in the industry.", "In Wireline, we continue to make steady progress. We had a very strong quarter of customer growth in FiOS with our third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement, adding more than 200,000 new customers in both TV and Internet, our highest net add totals since the second quarter of 2009.", "Revenues in global enterprise were stable, showing modest sequential improvement. And while the wireline revenue picture is essentially unchanged, we were able to improve our EBITDA margin on sequential basis, coming in more than 20 basis points higher than last quarter at 21%.", "We'll talk more about this in a few minutes, but we feel confident that our workforce and other cost reduction efforts have stabilized wireline profitability, and we should continue to see these benefits in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. Our improved business performance and tight controls on capital have resulted in significant increases in free cash flow for the first nine months of the year. And our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key credit metrics and strength in the balance sheet.", "I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September, which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.90 to $1.95 a share. This marks the fourth consecutive year of dividend increases. So all in all, we're pleased with our continued strong performance.", "Let's now move to a more detailed review of the quarter, starting with some financial highlights on Slide 4.", "Reported earnings for the quarter were $0.31 per share. The non-operational charges amounted to $0.25. So you can see that gets us to a $0.56 quarterly result. So we're building solid earnings momentum.", "I would point out that we saw about a $0.01 EPS benefit in the third quarter due to a lower effective tax rate post the Frontier spin-off. For the full year 2010, absent any further significant tax law changes, you should expect that the adjusted effective tax rate attributable to Verizon will be in the 31% to 32% range. Consolidated topline growth accelerated to 2.1% year-over-year and drove an 8.3% increase in operating income.", "Our adjusted EBITDA margin also expanded 130 basis points to 33.4%. And cash flow continues to be very strong. One addition point on earnings, we are seeing sequential improvement. Slide 5 shows our quarterly earnings on a comparable basis. So our $0.56 per share this quarter is a 7.7% improvement over the second quarter.", "Let's spend a few more minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and debt on Slide 6.", "Cash flow from operations in the third quarter totaled $8.3 billion and free cash flow was $4.2 billion. On a year-to-date basis, cash flow from operations of $25.2 billion is up 9.1%. And free cash flow of $13.4 billion is up $2.7 billion or 25.3%.", "In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in early July that we used to reduce debt and a cash distribution of about $440 million from Omnitel this quarter. As I highlighted earlier, our Board approved a dividend increase for the fourth consecutive year, demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow and balance sheet and our commitment to return cash to shareholders.", "In addition, our shareholders received $1.85 per share and value through the Frontier transaction in July. I can assure you that we have adequate dividend coverage based on our cash flow and our capital spending outlook. We have no material funding requirement for our qualified pension plans in 2010. And as is customary, we fund our other post retirement benefit plans on a pay-as-you-go basis out of operating cash flows.", "Looking at capital, we spend $4.2 billion during the third quarter which was 4.5% less than a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, total CapEx was $11.8 billion, 4.9% below the first nine months of last year. During the year, we've effectively reallocated capital between our operating segments, reflecting growth opportunities. In wireless, capital spending is higher than last year, driven by 4G LTE deployment and network capacity requirements.", "Wireless CapEx totaled $6.2 billion year-to-date which is an increase of $1.1 billion or about 21%. In Wireline, capital spending is down reflecting lower files deployment capital as planned. And our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx was $5.1 billion year-to-date, a decrease of $1.5 billion or 23%.", "Looking ahead, we expect our total capital spending for the year will be at the low end or slightly below our targeted range of $16.8 billion to $17.2 billion for 2010. In terms of the balance sheet, our top priority has been to reduce leverage. We're doing very well here with net debt of $47.8 billion at the end of the third quarter down $12.5 billion or 20.7% since the beginning of the year.", "Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has improved to about 1.4 times, and we expect to be even lower by the end of the year. Let's take a look at our revenue trends which are on Slide 7.", "Our overall revenue performance is improving, and we saw an acceleration of growth in the third quarter on a comparable basis. Consolidated quarterly revenue of $26.5 billion were up $550 million or 2.1% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all our strategic areas which comprised roughly two-thirds of our total revenue.", "We'll get into more detail at the segment level, but we saw an uptick in wireless service revenue growth driven of course by strong data performance. We had a very good quarter in FiOS with year-over-year revenue growth of more than 29%. And growth in strategic enterprises services is accelerating, up nearly 7%.", "With that high level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless on Slide 8.", "Our Wireless business turned in another very good quarter particularly respect to revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.3 billion on the quarter, up $919 million or 6% year-over-year. And growth in total service revenue accelerated to 7.7% in the third quarter, our highest year-over-year growth rate since the second quarter of 2009. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband drove data revenue to $5.1 billion this quarter, up 26.3% over last year; that's more than $1 billion of growth in just one year.", "We continue to make excellent progress in terms of increasing our smartphone penetration. With 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices, we feel very good about our current portfolio smartphones and we've build great momentum in a short period of time with Droid franchise. Our recent announcement to begin selling Apple iPads at retail locations is designed to stimulate sales of our MiFi devices which have already become quite popular with customers.", "We're performing well in this very competitive marketplace, but as confident we are about our ability to compete today, we are even more excited about the future.", "Earlier this month at a CTIA event in San Francisco, Lowell McAdam announced our Phase I 4G LTE launch locations. Our plan is to cover more than 110 million POPs and 38 major metropolitan areas and 62 airports by the end of this year. In the next phase we'll expand coverage to about 200 million POPs over the next 18 months. By the end of 2013, we'll have virtually the same nationwide coverage we have today on 3G.", "With wireless data revenue exceeding $5 billion this quarter, it's hard to believe that we're still in the early earnings in terms of this revenue growth opportunity. But we are very excited about mobile broadband, and we believe the growing interest in smartphones, tablets and other devices signals a new wave of growth for the industry.", "With the commercial launch of LTE just around the corner, we are extremely well positioned in this expanding market. We firmly believe that our network advantage will become even more of a differentiator for Verizon, given the consistent and substantial investment in our wireless network over many years.", "Let's now turn to our customer and connection results on Slide 9. We had a solid quarter of growth, adding about 1 million net new customers and about 250,000 other connections. In the retail postpaid market, we had 584,000 net adds and a strong quarter in terms of device sales. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up 9.8% sequentially, and device upgrades were also higher.", "Our performance in the reseller channel was also very good with 550,000 net adds this quarter. As we've said before, the reseller market continues to be a low-cost channel for us, and an effective way for us to attract incremental prepaid customers. We ended the quarter with 93.2 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% reseller. In terms of other connections, we had a total of 7.9 million machine-to-machine connections, which include vehicle tracking and telematics.", "Let's take a closer look at our retail performance on Slide 10. As you know, our key focus is on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to drive revenue growth by increasing data usage and driving higher smartphone penetration. Retail service revenues in the quarter grew 5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid ARPU increased 2% compared with a year ago, sharply higher than the year-over-year accretion we saw in each of the first two quarters of this year.", "As I mentioned a moment ago, we had another strong quarter of overall device sales with about 9.5% of our existing postpaid customers upgrading to a newer device, our highest level since the fourth quarter last year. Our churn metrics, although a bit higher than the second quarter due to seasonality, were excellent once again this quarter. Retail postpaid trend was 1.07% and total churn was 1.36%.", "In terms of smartphone sales, we now have 23% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. That's up substantially from last year, and there's plenty of headroom left. About 43% of device sales from our direct channels this quarter were smartphones, taking into account both gross adds and upgrades. And 60% of our existing postpaid customers buying smartphones were new to the category. So this is significant in terms of incremental data revenue for us.", "Revenue from web and e-mail services increased to more than 2.7 billion this quarter, up above 43% from a year ago.", "Messaging, which makes up about 36% of data revenue is still showing good growth, up 11% on a year-over-year basis. And we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time, adding 8.4 million smartphone customers, and increasing data ARPU by 17.6% in the past 12 months. We believe penetration and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years, particularly in light of the growth opportunities in front of us with LTE.", "In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 11.4% from a year ago. Our third quarter service EBITDA margin was 47.2%, driven by strong data revenues, churn improvement and the continued benefit of Alltel synergies.", "Looking ahead, you can expect us to continue achieving both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of smartphones and other data devices which will drive continued data revenue growth.", "Let's move to our Wireline segment on Slide 13. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 29.2% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds $146 is up more than 6% over the third quarter last year.", "On the enterprise side, we had our second consecutive quarter of sequential revenue improvement in growth and strategic services, which includes security, IP and other managed solutions, continues to transform the revenue mix. In global wholesale, revenues continue to be impacted by the effect of some international price changes on specific groups, which were introduced last quarter to better manage margins.", "Let's take a closer look at the consumer and business markets starting on Slide 14. This time last year, FiOS made up about 40% of consumer revenue. At the end of the third quarter, it was up to 50%. The increasing scale of FiOS and the strength of the broadband and video product is driving positive revenue in ARPU growth and mitigating the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business.", "Consumer revenue in the quarter grew 1.1% versus last year. We continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $86.55 this quarter, up 10.9% from a year ago. As I said earlier, we had strong sequential customer growth, adding about 19% more FiOS customers this quarter to our TV services, and about 17% more to our internet product compared to last quarter.", "We ended the third quarter with a total of 3.3 million FiOS TV customers, adding 204,000 compared with the 172,000 in the second quarter. On the broadband side, we added 226,000 new FiOS internet customers, compared with the 193,000 last quarter bringing our total to 3.9 million.", "Adding in high speed internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.3 million broadband connections.", "Underlying the strong performance is the fact that our FiOS customer satisfaction is very high, and our churn rates are very low. So we're pleased with the progress we are making with FiOS, financially, operationally and competitively.", "The good news about our success in penetration increases this quarter is that the improvements are evident throughout our entire FiOS footprint. Our focus has shifted from a geographic expansion mode to a focus on sales mode. Our goal is to increase FiOS penetration in markets where the service is already available and close the gap between homes passed and homes open for sale.", "The launch of our nationwide, no contract required, Worry Free Guarantee has helped sales, particularly in the MDU market where apartment dwellers in large urban cities tend to be more (transient) and may be more hesitant to sign two year contracts. And we focused our marketing message to emphasize our product differentiation. This focus on sales and increasing penetration is paying off, and in our more mature FiOS markets we are still seeing consistent penetration gains. Penetration in some of these markets is in excess of 35%, and a few are in excess of 40% penetration.", "As you would expect, in our less mature markets we have significantly more room to grow. So we're optimistic about our ability to further increase penetration and continue our growth path over the next several years.", "Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 16, which shows our Global Enterprise and Global Wholesale revenue performance.", "While revenues in the business market continue to be affected by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing some signs of stability. Global enterprise revenue of $3.9 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis, and down 0.8% year-over-year, primarily due to foreign currency effects. And while the quarter once again included strong CPE sales, we also saw improvements in revenue from network and solutions-based services.", "Strategic services, which now represent about 43% of global enterprise revenue, grew 6.9% year-over-year and 3.1% sequentially. Strategic networking, like Private IP and Ethernet services continue to show steady growth, as do strategic solutions. So again, we are seeing some signs of stabilization, but we are still cautious in our optimism as usage volumes and unemployment figures have not shown any significant change.", "In Global Wholesale, revenues declined 10.2% year-over-year and 1.3% sequentially. Domestically, voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes.", "Internationally, we made a decision earlier this year to increase voice pricing in certain routes which has resulted in some loss of business in this highly competitive market. While the strategy has resulted in revenue declines, is having as a side effect as absolute margins on those routes have improved sequentially.", "Let's cover wireline profitability next.", "In the third quarter, EBITDA increased by $31 million resulting in a more that 20 basis point sequential improvement in our EBITDA margin to 21%. With total revenue remaining essentially flat sequentially, almost all of the improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost reductions, primarily wage-related savings and third party interconnection cost.", "Our workforce reduction initiative is proceeding as planned. Wireline headcount was down 5,900 this quarter and has declined by about 10,500 over the past two quarters. As you know, a majority of these reductions relate to our voluntary separational effort in the East and Mid-Atlantic regions. With about another 1000 volunteers in other regions, we expect another 2000 to 3000 employees will leave our payroll by the end of the year.", "In terms of workforce reductions in the third quarter, we estimate the savings to be about $80 million. Partially offsetting these cost savings this quarter were acquisition costs related to higher FiOS customer volumes and some typical seasonal increases, including higher energy cost.", "Lastly, in terms of our other cost reduction initiatives, we are focused on capturing additional savings in real estate, network convergence, supply chain and inventory management. We have a well organized and realistic plan, and we are confident in our execution strategy.", "To sum up, we had another very solid quarter across the entire business, resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. To reiterate, we are on track to achieve our goal of growing earnings in the second half of this year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted days of $1.10 per share.", "Our wireless results were solid across the board. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers, and driving higher smartphone adoption leading to higher postpaid ARPU and improved revenue growth. And with our demonstrated ability to manage our cost, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin even with higher volumes and more upgrades than last quarter.", "In our wireline business, even though we're not getting any help from the economy, and we don't expect to for the rest of this year, our cost reduction programs have stabilized wireline profitability, and we are optimistic about our opportunities to expand margins going forward.", "As always, we will continue to focus on maximizing free cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet and reducing debt. We are excited about our opportunities relating to a launch of 4G LTE services in wireless, and we are certainly very confident in the long term potential of the business.", "With that, I'll turn it back to John so that we can get to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Couple of questions maybe first on wireless ARPU. The fourth quarter we've seen an accelerating postpaid ARPU growth. I'm just thinking, through these increases in smartphone penetration, which seem to really give you a good runway for further improvements in the rate of ARPU growth from here, I am just wondering if that's how you would think about it as well.", "And then, second question on FiOS. Good uptick in both FiOS, video and data adds. When thinking about the increase, can you just help us think through, is this attached to seasonal, is it the no contract moves that you've made and ultimately I thing what we're trying to get to is, is this kind of a new level that we should use as a run rate going forward?", "John Killian", "I will take the first part of the question on ARPU, and then Fran will cover the FiOS performance.", "We are very pleased with what's happening with ARPU. When you look at our postpaid ARPU this quarter, we were up 2% from the third quarter. If you look back the last four quarters, fourth quarter '09 we were flat. We went to DOCSIS in the first quarter, we went to 1.5. And you all have seen that I have had on these clauses, we believe there is a lot of upside ahead of us and we have great ability to grow postpaid ARPU because of the explosion in smartphones.", "We've put a lot of energy, Lowell McAdam, John Stratton, Dan Mead, their team, on enhancing our smartphone portfolio. We've had great success over the last year with the DROID franchise and the Blackberry lineup and others, but we're in a much better position. But the good news here is only 23 % of our customers today have a smart phone. That's up from 20 last quarter.", "So you think about this I don't know where it's going to end up, but personally I think we're going to look some day back and say 70% to 80% of your customers are going to have a smart phone.", "So we think there is tremendous opportunity here. And you know better than I do, Jason, smart phone customers spend about double what a feature phone customer spends with you.", "We also believe on the feature phone side, more and more customers will buy some data plans over time even before as they are getting used to data on the wireless side. That'll start with a plan on a feature phone. So we think there is tremendous opportunity here to grow topline in the wireless business. And you can see that coming through and accelerating revenue growth in the wireless business.", "Fran, I'll turn to you on FiOS.", "Fran Shammo", "So to talk about the FiOS ads and the broadband ads, we are very pleased with the strong performance that we had this quarter. If you look at some of the questions you asked, Jason, on the no contract, as John has spoken in the past, in the MDU space, we were underpenetrated there. We have made a lot of moves, including the no contract. But we also made a move on the contract where we offer Worry Free Guarantee similar to the wireless side of the house. But if you're not totally satisfied, we will let you out of the contract with no early termination fee.", "We also have launched a triple play in the MDU space, understanding that a lot of this space is the younger adult segment, which if you look at the triple play that we have launched is broadband, it's TV and it's wireless rather than a wireline connection. So we found that that's also stimulating some growth in the MDU segment.", "When you expand that, the no contract definitely has had a very good growth prospective for us, but we have also launched something new in our enterprise space where we are going to our enterprise customers and very similar to what we do on the wireless side with employee liable accounts, we are signing up enterprise customers to promote our FiOS product within their employee base. So that has also stimulated some growth for us.", "So to wrap this up, yes, we feel that this level of ads is where we want to continue to be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "First, on the wireless data pricing strategy, are you guys recently making changes or are there some in the press? And I guess I was surprised that you left the unlimited data plan out there. Is that a part of your strategy to increase the penetration of smart phones, and is that pricing essentially subject to change once you move to 4G and you potentially see data volumes grow?", "And then secondly on the wireline margins, it seems like you may have arrested the decline and you're starting to see some improvement. It sounds like fourth quarter, you see some sequential improvement. Is that something that we can see improve from here as we head out? Is there enough cost cutting opportunity for us to see improvements into 2011?", "John Killian", "Again, I will take the first part of this question and then Fran will talk about the wireline margin. So I think what you're referring to John is some of the blog reports and some of the newspapers stories. We have not formally announced any change in data pricing, but we will be rolling out a data promotion next week focused on the fourth quarter.", "As we think about data pricing here and just to give you a little things to think about as we position this for the future, our aim here is really at expanding the market opportunity. We think there is a huge opportunity to continue to grow. We have a $20 billion annual wireless data business, $5 billion a quarter. It's hard to describe that as early innings, but we still believe it's the early innings of the data explosion. We're very focused at looking at opportunities to expand this opportunity, bring more of our base into data plans.", "The other thing to think about here is we believe we have built over time because of what we have done both with network investment, our advertising programs, is superior brand position that allows us to be unique in how we approach the marketplace from a data pricing, unique from what other companies do because of the brand position that we have built over time.", "Our fourth quarter promotion that we will have will have really two key elements we will continue to have in unlimited plan, the $29 plan, the $30 plan effectively that is unlimited. But we'll also have a $15 plan. And with the $15 plan, you will be able to get 150 megabits of usage. But what we believe is that people who are new to category will probably buy the $15 plan. But over time, you will see much more migration to the higher end, because there will be a lot of usage that will drive above the 150 megabit. So we think we are in a very good position.", "John, we are encouraged by tiered pricing. We like the concept of tiered pricing. You could interpret this a little bit as a move in that direction, although we had $9.99 plan before, but we will continue to look at this and we probably will have some pricing changes when we roll out 4G and 4G pricing. So there will be more to comment.", "Fran will now talk about the wireline margin.", "Fran Shammo", "So on the wireline margin, John, as John has spoken in the past, we do believe we've stabilized, we do believe that we can continue to expand the margin in wireline business. I would say that this is a two-pronged strategy.", "One is obviously topline growth. And I think that it's important to know that we've reached an inflection point this quarter where FiOS is now 50% of our customer revenue. So as we continue to improve the consumer ARPU 10% this quarter year-over-year, that will drive bottomline growth. I think it's also important to state that on the enterprises side we're seeing stabilization; however, outside the United States, in our global markets, we are seeing double-digit especially in the Asia-Pac region and some other area parts of the world. So again, that is more topline.", "But as we get into the cost and productivity and sustainability, as John has spoken in the past, we have an incentive offer for our associates. We had 12,000 associates accept that offer. About 80% of them have left the payroll to date. We will do more of that in the fourth quarter.", "But it's also important to know that as we attack the cost side of the wireline business, it's more than just the headcount reductions. It's quarter-to-quarter improvement in our operating metrics, especially when you look at FiOS and our cost-to-connect prim and our cost-to-connect video. If you look at our COA, our COA alone year-over-year has gone down 19%. And with that reduction, we've increased our ad.", "So it's a whole program of cost reduction. I believe it's sustainable. And while we are doing that, we're improving our productivity, so that when the economy in the enterprise restores and we continue on the track that we're in FiOS, we will continue to produce more margin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "John, it was a pleasure working with you. Wish you all the best for your retirement. You touched on the LTE introduction. Could you help us understand what other impacts there might be in terms of expense recognition or interest capitalization and the things around that?", "And as you roll out the LTE from $110 million into the sort of $200 million plus, are we at a steady state level here on Wireless CapEx where you're out of a run rate? Or could there be a reduction or a lower intensity in '11 as the heavylifting for the first 38 markets has already been done?", "John Killian", "So, Simon, I think we're very pleased with where we are in terms of the LTE deployment. We mentioned getting to 110 pops by the end of this year. I talked to Tony Malone as recently as yesterday to get an update on status and all systems are go. The network will be in extremely good shape. From a normal customer acquisition in maintenance and those kinds of things, I think you're going to see the same kind of run rates looking ahead as you have seen, as we've gone through this year.", "I don't think you're going to see a major delta at all. In fact, we would argue overtime that there will be more efficiency driven by LTE because the cost of the megabit served is much lower with LTE than it is with EVDO and other technologies. So we think that will position us well. There will be some impact, we have been capitalizing some interest, it's not a huge number. But we will see some impact as we go into 2011, may be a little bit in the fourth quarter, but not a major delta there.", "From a CapEx perspective, what I would think about here is, on this call we've said we're going to come in at the low end of our range or slightly below. I think we have a good chance of being slightly below our guidance range on CapEx. You should think Wireless at probably at about the same level next year as it's running this year in that kind of a range.", "When you look this year, all of the increase we've had has really been for the most part, both on LTE as well as capacity for data. There had been other offsets; things like synergy capital will be going down. So I think it will be a very controllable level of Wireless CapEx. The nice thing here is the CapEx to revenue ratio in the Wireless business runs quite a bit lower than the Wireline business. And there is a lot of efficiency from that capital. So I think our cash flow numbers should continue to be strong.", "Operator", "You next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "Just to follow up on that, more specifically on the Wireline side, how should we think about capital going into next year as the pace of new FiOS home is passed, continues to slow? And then coming back on the Wireless side, I noticed the replacement rate was around 9.5%, and then smartphones become a larger part of your base, and then hence a larger percent of the replacement volumes. How should we be thinking about the incremental cost related to that?", "And are there areas that you can identify to may be offset some of that upward pressure from just a greater pace of smartphone replacements overtime?", "John Killian", "So a couple of thoughts for you here, Mike, and we're not in a position yet to give any guidance on CapEx for next year. But as I think about this, and certainly Fran will be talking about this in January. I think the direction of overall CapEx spending, and we've said this in the past, is down from where we are today. I'm not going to quantify that exactly, but if you think about Wireless continuing to run next year at about the same level, I think Wireline will come down. We are coming towards the end of the FiOS build out.", "So directionally, I think overall CapEx spending will come down in 2011 from 2010. I think we've had tremendous disappointment within the business around all of our CapEx spending, not only on core network, but on systems and supporting infrastructure. And we've also gotten much more efficient. A portion of our CapEx is labor, it's not just material. And we've gotten more efficient with that. So I think we're in a good position to continue posting very strong cash numbers in free cash flow.", "The upgrade level, we're very pleased with the upgrade level that 9.5% of our base upgraded in the quarter. Upgrades are a key focus for us. And as I think about it, upgrades right now are all good, and will be all good for quite a while to come, because a lot of times it's a feature phone customer going to a smartphone customer. I'm willing to take that equipment for us and that subsidy when I'm getting 2x the revenue.", "So it's not an issue that we're concerned about, we see it much more as an opportunity in providing upside to us in terms of revenue growth and profitability.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "David Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Just two more if could on FiOs and sorry to beat the horse a little bit, John. But when we've been talking about FiOS winding down, there's been a very specific number that we would save about $2 billion a year in Wireline CapEx. And I guess it kind of sounds like may be you're already starting to realize some of that as you've been winding that down may be sooner than expected.", "So could you put more specific numbers, as this thing comes to an end in 2010, what the dollar savings should be from that project relative to the $2 billion you guys have been talking about for a couple of years?", "And then I guess the second part is now that FiOS is 60% of the footprint and 50% of the revenue of the wireline unit, could you give us more color about what are the margins now on this business and how does its growth either benefit or dilute wireline margins as we model that out into the next couple of years?", "John Killian", "Let me hit a couple of things here is, we have said in the couple billion dollar range, we are realizing some of that this year because we had been building at a $2 million premise passed roughly, and we're going to build roughly $1 million this year. So in our program this year, we've seen some benefit there. We will continue to see that as we go into 2011 and 2012.", "But the message here is, I think we become more efficient with the capital spend, our cost per home passed has been very good. We're very pleased with that and I think overall, I think the direction of CapEx spend will be down as we go into next year.", "From a margin perspective, we're very pleased with where we are. FiOS overall, we're very pleased with. We are up, income-positive here. We continue to grow that this quarter, because we ramped up and had more net adds than we had had in previous quarters. That had some impact in terms of the ability to expand the margin in this particular quarter. It is overall accretive to the margins of the overall business. We don't put out specific numbers and we're not going to do that right now, Dave.", "But the good news here is, we accelerated penetration with the changes Fran has really led, putting in place. We feel we're in a better position from an acquisition standpoint. There's a lot more buzz around the FiOS capability and the quality of video vis-\u00e0-vis our competition. So we think we're very well positioned and FiOS is continuing to do well.", "David Barden - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.", "Is that 50% of the revenues in the wireline business, is the margins in that higher or lower than the reported margins for the unit?", "John Killian", "It's higher than the reported margins, Dave.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "You got a question earlier about how you're seeing this ramp in smart phone adoption. We're still seeing really strong wireless margins. And I think that that has been depriving to a lot of people in that the adoption of smartphones had kind of compressed margins in a lot of other operators, first, because you take (sub-Zs) upfront, and then you started getting a lot of these sort of network abusers who are using more than what they're really paying for under an unlimited plan.", "So I guess sort of the question here is, what could cause your margins to take a step backwards as we continue to scale in the data world? Could it be an investment you'd be willing to make in a new device category? Is there something incremental you'd want to do on the network side that you haven't done yet or really sort of sketched out for us yet? Or do you think that you can continue to run at these record levels of EBITDA margins even as you see accelerated usage of your data services?", "John Killian", "I have to thank you, because you have not broken the record that I've had on every call, a question very much like this. Good question. About the question going to sustainability of our margins in the wireless business, as you know, we're very pleased. Low McAdam whose new President and Chief Operating Officer likes to describe us as an 'and' company not an 'or' company. So it's both growth and profitability, and we've always said that.", "The 47.2 is 157 basis points up year-on-year; it's comparable sequentially. We believe that really reflects the superior execution and scale of the ethics that our wireless team has built over several years. We've build tremendous scale in that particular business. We're able to absorb more subsidies and continue to do really a very strong job on margins.", "Now a couple of points here I'd make is, this is not a one-trick pony result. If you look at revenue, we have a very nice improving revenue trend in the wireless business. Service revenue in the fourth quarter was up 5%, first quarter 5.8%, second quarter 6.3%, and third quarter 7.7%. And that's only with 23% of our customers having smartphones today.", "So we believe as we go through the next several years and we go up that smart phone adoption, we're going to be able to grow revenue, grow profitability. We think our network is very well positioned for the growth in data traffic. We put tremendous time and focus on this, with Lowell and Dan Mead and Tony Malone on making sure we're well-equipped.", "Our assumptions assume that our handset lineup that we think is very strong today, where we put all the emphasis on again the Droid franchise. And the Droid franchise is unique to Verizon. It positions us very well; in our handset lineup we'll get better over time. It's not going to take a step backwards; it will continue to be enhanced.", "And is it possible we have a quarter where there's a knockout device that has some impact on margins? There's always a possibility of that happening; we've acknowledged that in the past. And that would be a good thing to have happened because of what you would do from a smart phone adoption in your overall ARPU.", "Now the other part of this is our wireless team is not only focused on net adds and growth and ARPU, tremendous focus on driving efficiency in the business, they've been working on driving cost out of supply chain. You've seen the tremendous results they've had this year on lowering their inventory level.", "At a time you have new product introductions focused on driving cost out of customer service, driving more online interactions, eliminating things like other charges and credit OCCs controlling them, retail store efficiency. So we think the scale we built in that business allows us to continue to have the lead in the industry on margins, and we not going to give that up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "What do you think revenue growth can do for next couple of years? You've always been accelerating up. Do you see the business as kind of a 3% or 4% revenue grower? And may be related to that, how much did you wholesale pricing changes impact revenue in the quarter? And I have a brief follow up if you don't mind?", "John Killian", "Yes, okay. So, Tim, generally, I absolutely think we can accelerate revenue growth from where we are today. I mean I think the wireless business on a service ARPU at 7% can get up in the high single digits and can touch 10% with data growth.", "The wireline revenue picture looks a little worse this quarter than it really is. We posted in number of 3.6%, but a major driver on that going a little bit worse from last quarter was, we made some price changes in our International Wholesale business, because we had certain roots out in the world that really weren't driving profitability.", "So when you look at our International Wholesale revenue, it was down year-over-year by 28%. If you strip that out, our Wireline revenue was only down 2.4% versus the 3.6% that we reported. And then as you cut under that, Consumer is growing at the rate of 1.1%; we saw a better performance on small business.", "Our Enterprise revenue, while it was negative-0.8%. If you break FX out, it was flat. So the underlined trends, even in the Wireline business, are better than, we think the 3.6% number would show. And I think, we believe, we can get the Wireline business, over the next couple of years with some help from the economy, to flat, and may be to slightly growing. And if we do that, that would be very important for the business overall, because Fran talked about it no question.", "We still have the lot of ability to drive more and more cost out. But we got to get that business growing again, and we're very focused on that and we think we can. But the Wireless business, there's going to be tremendous opportunity to continue to accelerate the revenue growth on that business.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "John, just on your wireless business, you clearly have a premium network out there. Do you think when you get the iPhone, you can charge a premium price either for the device or for the service or some kind of application sharing? We're not asking when you're getting the iPhone, but clearly there would be a huge benefit for subscribers being on your network versus your competitor.", "John Killian", "Well, I talked earlier, Tim about how we think about pricing. So we're very focused on the device line up we have today. We think we have a great device line up. The Droid franchise has gone from nothing a year ago, to where it really has a buzz and a lot of momentum out on the marketplace right now.", "From a pricing perspective, we think the brand that we have built puts us in a unique position from a pricing perspective. We've always been a bit at a premium, and we think the brand will allow us to continue to do that.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Chris Larsen of Piper Jaffray.", "Chris Larsen - Piper Jaffray", "A question back to FiOS, you obviously picked up some share or it appears based on with the cable companies said that you picked up some share both on video and on data. My question is really, there has been a lot of back and forth there, have you begun to see anything so far in the fourth quarter that indicates the cable companies were getting more aggressive either on their video or the data pricing?", "And then additionally, there were some comments made actually in the New York Post recently that cable is considering a massive increase or a material increase in their high speed data prices to offset some of this over the top video that maybe going on. If cable were to do that, is that something you guys would follow along with that is a large increase or a material increase in your data pricing?", "John Killian", "I think, Chris, a couple of thoughts here is, the FiOS video business and internet business, we've always said every quarter it's a very competitive out there. I wouldn't say we've seen anything recently that changes the competitive landscape from an offer or a price perspective. With the changes that Fran has led for us on the worry-free guarantee, the contract, no focus on the MDU, we think we're in a very good possession.", "We haven't planned any price changes here at this point in time; we would always continue to look at what's happening in the competitive landscape. We think our FiOS offering from, based on the fiber end to end is a superior offering from a quality standpoint. And we've been focused very much on acquisition and getting people to move.", "So we would continue to evaluate that and look at what the opportunity to accelerate revenue growth.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital.", "James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital", "One on capital structure and the other on FiOS. On the FiOS side for broadband, where are the ads coming from? I know a material portion in the past have been people being switched from DSL to FiOS, is that continuing? And is the mix changing in terms of DSL switches versus people coming presumably over from cable?", "And secondly on the capital structure side, if you're looking at dividend in cash up from Verizon Wireless, how much of a buffer do you have in terms of realized and taxed proportional profits of Verizon Communications that haven't actually represented cash dividend is up for Verizon Wireless? So in other words, how much could you dividend end up form VZW before you start to actually have to pay incremental tax on those payments?", "John Killian", "Let me just start with the capital structure. We are very pleased with our cash performance. We think the wireless business, you can see it's a cash machine, the cash generation of that business is not going to decelerate, if anything, it's going to accelerate. We're in a very good position from that perspective.", "We believe that Verizon dividend is extremely safe. There is not a major tax issue here that I'm worried about that's going to have some impact on this. So we think we are in a good position. Fran and his team has had a lot of focus on trying to make the Wireline business more free cash flow positive. We'll continue to work at that. But our cash flow margin is in a very good position, and you can see it from this quarter. Fran will comment on the FiOS question.", "Fran Shammo", "On the migration question. Yes, we continue to migrate some of our former DSL customers into the FiOS broadband. But if you look at our net ads, if you take the internet net ads form our FiOS product less our DSL, we're still on a positive take share perspective.", "The other thing to consider too is, is that when you look at the penetration of our internet at 31 and our TV at 27, what we find is once we convert someone over to our FiOS internet product with the speed that we have and the amazement that they get from that, it's very easy for us to then walk in behind that and convert over the TV because we can bundle it and save them money.", "So I think that we do have migration from DSL, but we are also taking share.", "John Killia", "Just a couple of things then wrap up here. I hope you can see that we feel very positive about the performance of the business this quarter. We had given you some direction that we felt we needed to do about where earnings would be in the second half of the year.And in this quarter, we are at the very high end of that range; that's our focus for the fourth quarter. We will continue to deliver in the fourth quarter the kinds of things we delivered here; strong wireless results driven by continuing ARPU acceleration and stronger smartphone results.", "We've stabilize the Wireline business from a margin position. We'd actually expanded them slightly in this quarter. We believe that will accelerate as we get into the fourth quarter. and our cash flow position is very strong and will remain very strong. So I thank you for taking the time, I'll pass back to John just to close up the clock.", "John Doherty", "Well that concludes our call today.

Welcome to Verizon's Investor Conference. Thanks for joining us here at Cipriani Wall Street, where we are live webcast, where I understand we have an additional 500 plus people that have signed in. We hope you're all as excited as we are to be meeting with you in person, as we end 2010 and kick off 2011. Before we get started, I would like to point out that our fourth quarter earnings release, financial statements, investor quarterly publication and the earnings presentation slides are all currently available on our Investor Relations website. At the conclusion of this morning's meeting, the strategic and financial overview piece will also be posted to the website for your reference and use.

If you can switch to the agenda slide. We will start our session this morning with the review of our fourth quarter earnings by Fran, and then we're going to have a brief Q&A session just after that, where I'd really like you to stay focused on the earnings that we released in that piece of the agenda. We're going to be followed by our strategic and financial piece, and then we'll open it up to a broader Q&A, where we'll have Ivan join us, as well as Fran and Lowell, of course.

Once again, I would like to thank all of you who are here and those of you on the webcast for joining us this morning and participating in this earnings call. Just a very short introduction here before I ask Fran to join us. I thought, with all of the moving parts and all of the strong momentum that we have been developing here in the end of 2010 and a very exciting set of prospects for 2011 and beyond, that our investors needed a little grounding in making sure they understood our strategic, operational and financial metrics. And hopefully, this morning, while we're not intending to make a lot of new, big news, I think you will be pleased to see Fran and Lowell share with you what they think the vision is and the model looks like as we go out into 2011 and 2012.  I also thought it was very important that you have a chance to see and touch and talk to both Lowell and Fran as we enter this important year, 2011. And for those of you here in person, of course, the opportunity to go in the back and play with our toys and all the new products and services is always a nice thing, and you\u2019ll get a chance to see how all of this new technology comes alive for the customer. So with that brief introduction, as John just mentioned, what we'd like to do is the structure. Our first order of business this morning is to cover 2010 earnings. And for that, let's ask Fran to come up and do that for us right now. Thank you.", "Francis Shammo", "Thank you, Ivan. Well, good morning, everyone. For those of you here in person, as well as those on our live webcast, I want to thank you for joining us today. During the transition period with John Killian, I had the pleasure of meeting a few of you. For many of you who I have not yet met, I would like to look forward to that later today or in the near future. Okay, so let's move into our first topic for today and review our fourth quarter and full year 2010 financial results. After my remarks, we'll take some questions, and then move onto the rest of the program. Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. The factors which may affect future results are contained in our SEC filings and are also available on our website. ", "So going to the next slide, for fourth quarter '10 overview. We ended 2010 on a high note, with very strong overall financial performance in the fourth quarter, driven by continued solid execution and growth across all of our businesses. The Wireless business is performing extremely well. Service revenue growth in the fourth quarter remains strong at 7.7% year-over-year, driven once again by Smart phone sales to both new and existing customers. We had a solid quarter of postpaid customer growth with 872,000 net adds, and we continue to see accelerating growth in postpaid ARPU, which was up 2.5% on a year-over-year basis. We improved our industry-leading customer retention metrics this quarter. In local number portability, we were net positive against all major carriers. ", "In terms of profitability, we reported a record high service EBITDA margin of 47.5%, which we are obviously quite pleased with. In Wireline, the financial picture continues to improve. We had positive quarterly revenue growth in consumer and enterprise, and the benefits, our workforce reduction and other cost initiatives are resulting in improved margin performance. The Wireline EBITDA margin expanded for the third consecutive quarter and was up 80 basis points sequentially, from an adjusted margin of 22.7% in the third quarter to 23.5% in the fourth quarter. This reflects the impacts of the pension accounting change between the Wireline segment and corporate. The sequential increase had nothing to do with the accounting change. It was driven by improved operational performance. ", "Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on opportunities to expand our Wireline margins. Our increased scale and the success of our FiOS products, including our recent launch of Flex View, are clearly helping both top line and margin performance in the consumer and small-business markets. Global enterprise revenue increased sequentially in the fourth quarter and showed positive growth of 1.3% year-over-year, driven by an acceleration of growth in the strategic services. In terms of cash generation, we had another outstanding quarter. For the full year, our improving operational performance, the tax benefit initiatives, the efficient capital management, resulted in an increase of free cash flow of $2.4 billion. Our focus on reducing leverage has improved our key metrics and strengthened the balance sheet. ", "Lastly, through a combination of share price appreciation and dividends, we generated a 23.1% return to shareholders in 2010. In addition, Verizon shareholders also received the equivalent of $1.84 per share in value through the spin-off of our Wireline properties to Frontier.  So all in all, I say we are very pleased with our financial performance. Let's now move to our detailed review of the quarter. So on the financial summary, let's start with earnings. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings for the quarter of $0.93 per share. The non-operational items amounted to a net favorable impact of $0.39. Setting these items aside, our adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.54. ", "As far as the non-operational impacts go, although the overall impact of accounting for pension and retiree benefits under the new methodology was a net cost of $600 million for the year. The fourth quarter impact was a net pretax gain of $2 billion or $0.44 per share. This was due to the previous recognition of pension and benefits losses resulting from pension settlements earlier in the year. The fourth quarter benefit was due primarily to favorable investment returns and an increase in the discount rate during the fourth quarter. The second non-operational item is merger integration cost related to Alltel. During the fourth quarter, charges related to these activities amounted to $0.05 per share. ", "This concludes our two-year integration program, and we will no longer be identifying these as non-operational costs going forward. Consolidated revenue growth in the quarter accelerated to 2.3% year-over-year, up from 2.1% year-over-year growth in the third quarter. For the full year, total revenues increased by $1.9 billion to $104.4 billion. Our fourth quarter operating income increased by 18.2% year-over-year compared with the third quarter growth of 11.3%. ", "For the full year, operating income grew $1.4 billion or 8.4%. The adjusted EBITDA margin grew 40 basis points sequentially to 33.6%, and was up 260 basis points from the fourth quarter last year. For the full year 2010, the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 32.9%. We're making good progress improving profitability. Our cash flow also remains very strong. More on that in a minute. ", "Now to adjusted EPS. First, I want to make a couple of additional points of clarification on earnings. The quarterly display on the chart before you show our earning results adjusted for the impact of divested operations, as well for the non-operational or one-time items which occurred during the year. The first thing I'd point out is that the first three quarters of 2010, as displayed on this slide, are different than what we showed you on the similar slide last quarter, and that is because of prior period adjustments due to the pension accounting change we announced last Friday. ", "Reported EPS changed, as did the amount of non-operational one-time items. The net effect was an incremental $0.01 charge to adjusted EPS. So whereas the first three quarters of adjusted EPS used to be $0.49, $0.52 and $0.56, they are now $0.48, $0.51 and $0.55, as shown on this slide. This reason for the painstaking detail here is because I want to tie back to our earnings guidance statements in July and October. ", "On our second quarter earnings call, we stated that our goal was to grow earnings in the second half of the year by 5% to 10% from our first half adjusted base of $1.01 per share, which excluded the earnings of the divested operations. That first half base is now $0.99 because of the accounting change. On our third quarter earnings call in October, we stated that our expectation was at the high end of this guidance. With our $0.54 in adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter and our $0.55 third quarter result, you see that we delivered on this earnings target, ending the year with adjusted earnings of $2.08 per share. This is the proper 2010 earnings base you should use when forecasting 2011. The important point here is that we saw an acceleration of earnings in the second half of the year. ", "Let's spend now a few minutes on cash flow, dividends, capital spending and the debt on the next slide. For cash flow from operations for the year, on a full year basis, totaled $33.4 billion, up 6.3%, and free cash flow was $16.9 billion, an increase of 16.4%. In addition, we received $3.1 billion in cash from the Frontier transaction in July, and a cash distribution of about $400 million from Omnitel, which we expect to continue in the future. ", "As we highlighted on our last earnings call, our board approved a dividend increase last September for the fourth consecutive year, demonstrating their confidence in the strength of our cash flow, our balance sheet, as well as our commitment to return cash to our shareholders. As stated previously, Verizon shareholders also received $1.85 per share in value through the Frontier transaction last July. Again, a very good year from a standpoint of shareholder return at 23.1% for the year. ", "Looking at capital expenditures, we spent $16.5 billion in 2010, which was $400 million less than 2009 and below our targeted range of $16.9 billion and $17.2 billion. As you know, during the year, we effectively reallocated capital between Wireline and Wireless, shifting more toward our growth opportunities in order to maximize investment returns. In Wireless, our capital spending was higher than 2009, driven by 4G LTE deployment and increased 3G network capacity requirements, which included preparing for the launch of the iPhone. ", "Wireless CapEx totaled $8.4 billion, which was an increase of $1.3 billion over 2009. Conversely, Wireline capital spending was down, reflecting lower FiOS deployment capital as planned and our tight focus on spending to increase free cash flow. Wireline CapEx for the year came in at $7.3 billion, a decrease of $1.6 billion compared with 2009. In terms of the balance sheet, our top priority has been to reduce leverage. We're doing very well here with total debt of $52.8 billion, down $9.5 billion or 15.2% for the year. Our cash balance at December 31 was $6.7 billion, so we ended the year with net debt of $46.1 billion, a reduction of $14.1 billion or 23.4% since the end of 2009. Our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio improved to about 1.3x from 1.9x at the end of 2009. ", "Let's now take a look at our revenue trends on the next slide. As I said earlier, our overall revenue performance is improving and we saw an acceleration of growth on a comparative basis in both the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Consolidated quarterly revenues of $26.4 billion were up $592 million or 2.3% from a year ago. Growth was driven by solid performance in all of our strategic areas, which roughly comprise 2/3 of our total revenue. We'll get into more details at the segment level, but the highlights are Wireless service revenue grew 7.7% on strong data results. ", "We had another strong quarter in FiOS with year-over-year growth of more than 26%, and we sustained growth in Enterprise Strategic Services of 7.5%. To be balanced, offsetting these growth areas were other parts of our business which are not growing. Services like international wholesale voice, core voice in our consumer and enterprise units and High Speed Internet outside the FiOS footprint. I would say, however, that these services, whether taken collectively or individually, are becoming a smaller portion of our overall revenue mix. During our decade-long strategic transformation, we have aligned our company with major growth trends driving our industry. You will hear much more on this from Lowell and myself later this morning. We are very optimistic about our future growth prospects. ", "With that high-level summary of revenues, let's move to the segments next, starting with Wireless. Our Wireless business turned in another extremely impressive quarter, particularly with respect to profitable revenue growth. Total revenue grew to $16.1 billion in the quarter, up $873 million or 5.7% year-over-year, with total service revenue up 7.7%. Our continued focus on expanding the market for mobile broadband drove data revenue to $5.3 billion this quarter and comprised 37.1% of total service revenues. During 2010, total data revenues increased to $19.6 billion. That's $4 billion of data revenue growth in one year. Think about that number, and then you can understand our excitement about the revenue opportunity with 4G LTE tablets, 4G LTE, all new 3G and 4G Smart phones that are coming to the market. We are confident that the Verizon network advantage will become even more of a differentiator in the marketplace in 2011 and beyond. ", "In terms of customer growth, we added a total of 955,000 net new customers. 872,000 of these were retail postpaid, which is roughly 50% more than we added in the third quarter. Retail postpaid gross adds in the quarter were up sequentially 5.2%. We ended the year with 94.1 million total customers, with 88% of the base being retail postpaid, 5% retail prepaid and 7% resell. In terms of other connections, we have a total of 8.1 million machine-to-machine connections, which include vehicle tracking and telematics. ", "Let's take a closer look at ARPU. As you know, we are focused on the retail postpaid market, where we continue to grow revenue by adding customers, increasing data usage and driving higher Smart phone penetration. Throughout the year, we saw accelerating postpaid ARPU growth from 0.6% year-over-year growth in the first quarter to 1.5% in the second to 2% in the third and now, 2.5% in the fourth quarter. Clearly, we are gaining momentum in this critical metric through increased Smart phone penetration. Retail postpaid data ARPU was obviously a big driver with year-over-year growth of 19.3% in the fourth quarter. ", "Revenue from Web and email services increased to more than $2.9 billion this quarter, up more than 43% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 35% of data revenue, is still showing good growth, up 9.6% on a year-over-year basis. And our strategy of stimulating data growth and Smart phone penetration is also improving customer retention. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent. Total churn for the quarter improved 1.34%. Our retail postpaid churn was 1.01%, improving by six basis points sequentially and four basis points year-over-year. ", "Now to Smart phones and devices. In terms of Smart phone penetration, we now have 26% of our retail postpaid base with these devices. That's up substantially from 15% one year ago, and there's plenty of headroom left. In the fourth quarter, more than 75% of our postpaid net adds were Smart phones, and 45% of our postpaid sales in the quarter, which include both upgrades and gross adds, were Smart phones. As far as upgrades, about 9% of our existing postpaid customer base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, a pretty strong result given our messaging around 4G LTE. Our Smart phones talk free promotion within family share plans was a big contributor to upgrades in the quarter. Interestingly, about 63% of Smart phone upgrades were new to this category, which is very good sign in terms of incremental data, revenue moving forward, even within our existing customer base. At the end of the year, we had 5.8 million data devices in our postpaid base with 323,000 added in the fourth quarter. Within this category, our Internet devices, like 3G and 4G PC cards, MiFi devices, tablets and notebooks. ", "So while we've made rapid progress in a relatively short period of time, adding 9.3 million Smart phone customers this year and substantially increasing data ARPU, we strongly believe both connections and data ARPU growth could really explode over the next several years with proliferation of 4G LTE devices and the iPhone opportunity. In just three weeks in December, we added 65,000 subscribers to our 4G network, of which 41% were new to Verizon. Wireless profitability. ", "In terms of profitability, we had another excellent quarter, generating $6.7 billion of EBITDA, up 14.6% from a year ago. Our fourth quarter's EBITDA margin was at 47.5%, a very strong result. We have consistently demonstrated our ability to sustain and expands margins this year through a combination of revenue, growth, effective cost-saving initiatives and continuing to mine synergy savings from the Alltel acquisition. In addition to effectively managing our cash cost per sub in a business as usual manner, we also identified and captured about $1 billion in additional cost savings in 2010 through focused efforts in our supply chain, customer service and a number of other areas within our business. And while we're encouraged by these savings, I certainly see more opportunity throughout the organization to further enhance productivity and make the business even more cost-effective. As always, you can expect us to continue to achieve both growth and profitability with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market and increasing the penetration of Smart phones and other data devices, which we drive continued revenue data growth. ", "Let's move to our Wireline segment. As I said during the highlights, we are encouraged by the improving revenue trends. The 2.8% year-over-year decline in the fourth quarter marks an improvement from a 3.6% decline the last quarter, and we have excluded the effects -- if we exclude the effects of the international wholesale pricing change, total Wireline revenues were down 1.1% year-over-year, mainly due to declines in other wholesale operations. On the consumer side, our broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 26.8% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU, which now exceeds our $146 per sub, is up more than 4% over the fourth quarter of last year. FiOS now accounts for 53% of our consumer revenue. On the enterprise side. We had our third sequential quarter of revenue improvement and growth in strategic services, which include security, IP, our managed solutions, continues to transform the revenue mix. ", "Let's now take a closer look at the consumer and business markets. Within the mass markets' category, consumer revenue of $3.4 billion in the quarter grew 1.6% versus last year. Here, we continue to see strong growth in consumer ARPU, which increased to $88.85 this quarter, which is up 10.7% from a year ago. As I've said, FiOS now represents about 53% of consumer revenue, which is important because the increase in scale of FiOS and the strength of our broadband video products are driving positive revenue and ARPU growth, and are now large enough to more effectively mitigate the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. ", "We had a solid quarter of growth in FiOS TV, adding 182,000 subscribers, which was a 22% improvement over fourth quarter last year. We ended the year with a total of 3.5 million FiOS TV customers, representing annual growth of better than 26%. Our FiOS TV penetration at year end stood at 28%. On the broadband side, we added 197,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the quarter, a 31% year-over-year improvement. Our FiOS Internet customer base increased 24% to 4.1 million in 2010, representing 32% penetration of homes opened for sale. By adding in our 4.3 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the year with a total of 8.4 million broadband connections. ", "Underlying our strong FiOS performance is the fact that our customer satisfaction ratings are very high and our churn rates are very low. Our renewed focus on sales and increased penetration is paying off. In our more mature FiOS markets, we are still seeing consistent penetration gains. Penetration at some of these markets is in excess of 35% and a few in excess of 40% penetration. In addition, as we stated at the end of the third quarter, multidwelling unit or MDU customers, have become a bigger portion of total net adds, particularly in the second half of the year. So again, we are pleased with our progress in FiOS, and we look ahead to a good year in 2011. ", "Let's move to business. While revenues in the business market continue to be challenged by macroeconomic pressures, we are seeing signs of improvement. Global enterprise revenue of $4 billion was up modestly on a sequential basis and also up 1.3% on a year-over-year basis, driven by increased CPE sales and improvements in key products within our strategic services category. Strategic services, which now represent 44% of global enterprise revenue, grew 7.5% year-over-year and 3.7% sequentially. Within this category, strategic nonworking, like private IP and Ethernet services, continue to show steady growth as do strategic solutions. Our security services grew 12% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, as we are seeing the benefits of being named the number one global leader security by Gartner Group. ", "Importantly, in the fourth quarter, the absolute dollar growth in strategic services outpaced the dollar decline in core enterprise services. We are encouraged by this, as the size of our strategic services is large enough to mitigate the secular and cyclical pressures elsewhere in the business. So again, we are seeing some early positive signs, but we still have cautious posture, as we look for additional signs of recovery in the broader economy. But overall, we are encouraged by improving trends in global enterprise. In global wholesale, revenues declined 12.1% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. ", "Domestically, voice revenues continue to be impacted by secular pressures and lower usage volumes. Internationally, our route rationalization strategy, where we increased voice pricing in certain geographies, has resulted in a loss of business and a substantial decline in international voice revenue. In the fourth quarter, we experienced $179 million decline on a year-over-year basis. Absent these effects, fourth quarter global wholesale revenues declined 5.5% year-over-year. Since we introduced these price changes in the second quarter last year, I'd say we have two more quarters of somewhat tough comparisons to work through before the revenue impact of these actions moderate. I think it's also important to add that while this strategy has certainly resulted in revenue declines, it is having the desired effect on profitability, as our absolute margin on these routes have improved. ", "Let's cover Wireline profitability. In the fourth quarter, EBITDA increased by $82 million, resulting in an 80 basis points sequential improvement and our EBITDA margin of 23.5%. Again, our historical margins have had upward adjustments due to the pension accounting change, but they are all on a comparable basis. That said, during the year, we increased the Wireline margin by 240 basis points from our low point of 21.1% in the first quarter. On an absolute dollar basis, our fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA was higher year-on-year for the first time in recent memory. While a majority of this improvement this quarter was once again driven by cost savings, third-party Internet connection cost, margin improvements were also helped by revenue growth in FiOS and global enterprise. ", "Our workforce reduction initiatives in 2010 were successful in helping us lower our cost structure and reduce our overall cost labor. The Wireline headcount declined by about 16,000 year-over-year. As you know, a majority of these reductions related to voluntary separation offers accepted by our associate workforce. While it's unlikely that our workforce reductions in 2011 will come close to what we experienced last year, our focus on continued -- to reduce the Wireline cost structure will be just as vigilant. I can assure you that this is one of my primary focus areas across the entire business, not just in Wireline. There are many more areas to capture additional savings, and you'll be hearing more on our progress as we move through the year. ", "So to sum this up, we had another solid quarter and strong second half of the year, resulting in improved earnings and solid momentum. We had strong Wireless growth with record high profitability. We remain confident in our ability to grow the business by adding new customers and driving higher Smart phone penetration. And with our demonstrated ability to tightly manage our cost structure, we continue to grow profitably, sustaining a very strong service EBITDA margin. As you've seen and heard this morning, our Wireline performance has improved over the course of the second half of the year. Our cost-reduction programs have stabilized Wireline profitability, and we are optimistic about our opportunities to further expand margins going forward, particularly as we begin to see an acceleration of revenue from our growth areas like FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services. Our sharp focus on capital spending discipline, maximizing free cash flow and deleveraging has resulted in a stronger balance sheet. ", "Let me wrap up here, as we will be sharing more on our strategic and financial outlook with you later this morning's program. At this time, I'll open it up to the floor for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "John Hodulik.", "John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank", "Quick question on the Wireless margins, the margins in the fourth quarter up sequentially. Could you give us a little bit of detail on the billion dollars in cost savings that you identified. Maybe, where they're coming from? If there are potentially more to go? And even more importantly, when those came out during the year? I mean, was it something that affected the latter half or even the fourth quarter more than the other quarters? And then maybe just a couple lines on some of the below the line items, which seem to be a little bit different than we'd expected this quarter.", "Francis Shammo", "So first, on the overall cost initiatives within Wireless. They set up the year on a $1 billion cost initiative, which crossed all types of things, like customer service, store operations, logistics, real estate. But the biggest one this year that had the most impact was logistics. In logistics alone, there was a $750 million cost reduction within the whole ecosystem of our logistics system. That came throughout the year, but obviously, the bigger part of that came in the second latter part of the year. So that really was the big portion. As I said, and I'm going to talk about later, they have yet another $1 billion challenge for 2011, and we could talk more about that in the later program. On the second issue, John, I think that as we look at what the consensus was, we were higher on EBITDA margin, we were higher on operating income margin. But then on the below the line item, I think the big disparity between consensus as us, is how minority interest is calculated. And of course a lot of that EBITDA margin was driven by the Wireless unit, so there was more minority interest, I think, than what was expected on the consensus side. So that's how we got down to the bottom.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Jason Armstrong from Goldman Sachs. First, just a follow up on John's -- the balance between strong adds and margins this quarter in Wireless, I think, really exceeded expectations. You guys put up a record Smart phone add quarter this year, but still had record margins, which really kind of frames, I think, the investor debate into next year because there's a sense out there that you can't maintain margins, EPS is going to drift because of the type of volumes you're going to see. So maybe just help us think through what actually happened in the fourth quarter. I'm sure there was obviously some cost-cutting initiatives that played into that, but just how that sort of sets the stage into next year. And then maybe on the volume metrics, the 870 in postpaid adds. It seems like there were actually probably some limitations at the customer level in 4Q, big network changes ahead, big handset refresh ahead, seems like that number actually could've been a lot higher. So what do you think maybe the run rate of the business is?", "Francis Shammo", "I think we're going to cover a lot more in the next session, but let me just set the stage. From a fourth quarter standpoint, even with the adds that we had in Wireless, with the cost reductions we had, we only had a 0.2% increase in our cash expense. So for all of the adds that we had, a significant majority of that dropped right to the bottom line. And I think that, as we've said before, and I'm going to have some fun in the later session because the question I always get is how long can you maintain these margins. And I'm going to have some fun with that in the next session. So hold that question. But I think as we go forward, I think you'd expect us to run the business like we always have. It's all about execution, and it's about execution on profitability and growth. And it's an and equation for us, it's not an or. So I think Lowell will speak a lot to the strategy. I'm going to talk a lot about the iPhone expectations, where we think it's going to be. So I think I'll come back to your questions in the second half.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Staying on the postpaid adds, you had a strong performance in the Internet devices. I think you said 323,000. Can you contrast that with where that was, say, your Q3 a year ago, what the delta is there and what the characteristics of those devices are in terms of ARPU? And then if you could just touch on what was going on in reseller and wholesale.", "Francis Shammo", "So on the Internet, we had our best quarter in the fourth quarter this year. And I think really, two things contributed to that increase. One is, as we said, within three weeks of launching 4G LTE, we sold 65,000 Boggles, 41% of them were new to Verizon. So that was a contributor to it. The second is, as we launched our tablets starting in October with the iPad, and then shortly thereafter with the Samsung, we sold about 86,000 tablets in all. 37,000 were just stand-alone iPads; the rest were all with iPad with a MiFi device and with the Galaxy. So 96% of them were new to the category. So these were folks who did not have any type of data usage on this type of a device before. So 96% of those customers were new to this category. So that helped boost the quarter from an add perspective. And then, I'm sorry, Simon, go to your second question again.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Resell or wholesale.", "Francis Shammo", "So on the reseller side, we grew by 152,000 net adds. And then on the prepaid side, we lost 70,000. And then I think the important thing here is obviously, as we've always said, we are a postpaid retail company. But we believe that those other segments are important. However, we're not going to chase those segments when we think that we can have more postpaid growth. And if you think about the Reseller segment and with the unlimited offerings that they used, they flip between carriers, depending upon who has the best price at that point in time. So I think you saw a little bit of that, but we still added 152,000 reseller net adds. On the prepaid side, as you saw, we launched new prepaid pricing at the end of the quarter, in December, adjusting our rate down to $1.99 from $3.99, but instituting a $0.02 text messaging fee. So we think that, that stimulated some more retail prepaid growth in the last month of the quarter, but it was not enough to offset the disconnects from October and November. So I think we see some little momentum going there, bringing our price down more to where the rest of the market was. On the wholesale side, I think it is important that we really distinguish this international coin, because if you think about it, on the 12.2% wholesale decrease, 28% of that was driven by the international wholesale piece. So when you state that out, the wholesale decline was only 5.5%. And we did that because, as we said before, there were a lot of routes that were not profitable or very slim margin routes, where we decided to raise our price. That traffic went away, the revenue declined, but I think as we work through that in the third quarter next year, I think you'll see a different picture for us going forward on wholesale.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "Could you talk a little bit more about the improvement in the Wireline margin? How much of that is labor-related versus non-labor types of cost improvement?", "Francis Shammo", "Well, I mean, obviously, we had a 16,000 reduction in labor this year. So there was a more of a significant impact there, and of course, a big majority of that was driven by the associate population who decided to accept the incentive that we put on the table and work with our bargaining folks. And we put that on the table, and 16,000 associates took that. So obviously, that was some of the decline. But I think there's more behind the story than just that. I think you have to look at the whole picture, which is the increasing of FiOS. So FiOS is becoming a bigger portion of consumer. And when you think about Access Line loss, we went from 9.3% Access Line loss down to 8% in the final quarter. So you're seeing a declining trend for us in access loss. So the other thing is, as you look at the ARPU on FiOS, it's becoming a much bigger segment, it's 53% of the consumer revenue. When you look at Access Lines, it's now only 7% of our overall corporate revenue from a consumer standpoint. So it is becoming less and less significant. FiOS continues to make progress and profitability. So I think you have to look at the whole thing. But obviously, there is a lot of cost reduction initiatives that are there. I mean, you can take the labor piece, but I think you also have to look at everything that Virginia Ruesterholz\u2019s group does out of Verizon Services organization, which is real estate, energy, fleet management. It is just disciplined execution on all those costs that help contribute it to the margin increase.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Just following up a little bit on that, two questions, if I could, on the Wireline top line. First, just specifically with respect to FiOS, as it now creeps over 50% of the consumer revenue. As it grows, is it a lower margin product that, as it grows, you need to cut costs faster? Or as it grows, is it margin accretive to the business? Is this a good thing it\u2019s growing, or is it not a good thing it's growing from a margin standpoint? And then second, just quickly on the enterprise recovery, we saw 1.3% growth. Was there any help or lift from the consumer premises equipment hardware side of that equation?", "Francis Shammo", "So from a FiOS prospective. The interesting part here with FiOS is as FiOS grows, it's becoming more profitable. And it's because we are becoming more efficient in how we connect the home, how we passed the home, how many labor hours it takes to connect that home. So if you look at the whole picture, the more we do, the better we are, and the better and the more efficient we get at it. Now, as I said, our goal is always to add between 180,000 and 200,000 TV net adds in a quarter. I think we've increased the penetration, as I said before also, in the third quarter, is we've concentrated much more on the MDU space. So if you look at the MDU's, we actually opened up 500,000 MDU open for sale this year versus only 300,000 last year. That became a bigger portion of our adds in the second half of the year and MDU's holistically, are more cost effective to connect because once you build the building, it's now just connecting all the apartments or condos within that building. So I think you're seeing some more of the efficiency there, which then drives more ARPU up. I think also, there's a couple things with Flex View. So we just launched Flex View. In the short period of time we've had Flex View out there, we've only had 2,000 titles on that platform. That will grow to over 9,000 by the end of next year. Within those eight weeks that we had Flex View out, we sold 41,000 titles at approximately $15 per title. So now those titles are in the cloud, which now these consumers can watch on any device, anywhere, anytime and around the world. So I think that is also going to help us drive some more incremental ARPU with very little cost, when you think about adding those Flex View titles. So I think that goes to the FiOS story. Then on the second piece with enterprise, the 1.3% sequential growth. Two components really helped with that growth. One was consumer premises equipment. But I will tell you that we have, over the last four quarters, have sequentially increased our price in consumer prem equipment. And I can tell you that we have doubled the margin on the amount of equipment we sell now. And I can also tell you that we have really moved ourselves away from what we would call drop shipment. We're letting other people plan the drop shipment space. Really, where we're selling consumer premises equipment is bundled with our strategic services and our IP components. So then when you take a look at the second component, which is really strategic services, we had our best growth of the year at 7.5% increase in strategic services. That was really driven by our security portfolio, which had a 12% increase year-over-year. We are gaining momentum in the marketplace on security because of the great ratings that we've gotten from Gartner as the number one global provider of security. So I think really the strategic services is really where we're focused at, the equipment comes with all the other bundles we're selling, but the equipment margin is increasing year-over-year. Okay, I think what I'll do is I'll stop there because, I want to get to the next part of the program. So what I'll do now is I'm going to invite Lowell McAdam, our President and Chief Operating Officer, up to the stage, and he will take us through the next phase of the program, which is more of a strategic discussion.", "Lowell McAdam", "Good morning, everybody. Thanks for braving the elements and coming in today. I saw lots of you are interested in all the goodies we have in the back of the room there. I will report nobody stumped the jukebox, however. I know a few of you tried to come up with a song that we couldn't pull out of memory, but, sorry. So far, no winners. Okay. So what I'd like to do is spend a few minutes this morning telling you where we stand as we enter 2011 and why I believe we're positioned so well to provide greater shareholder returns in the next several years ahead. I'm new in this position, and I've spent the last few months of this role traveling around Verizon, immersing myself in the details of the business and getting to know the business in its overall entirety. The more I do that, the more it's clear to me that Verizon's assets, both globally and domestically, are really the best in the business. As you know, I've spent the last, we've spent the last several years investing in strategic technologies, like FiOS and LTE, as you saw in the back of the room. We've been acquiring critical assets, like MCI and Alltel, so that we can extend our reach in the global markets and add scale to really deliver more on the bottom line. We've also divested lower growth, what I would call nonstrategic assets, in the Frontier and the FairPoint transactions, so that we can improve our ability to compete and grow in the markets that we choose to serve. So this superior asset base gives us really a solid foothold in the growth markets of the future for broadband, for wireless data, for video and for cloud services. I think businesses that we're seeing now are gaining scale and momentum, as we saw in the second half of 2010 and you saw in Fran's presentation earlier this morning. So I feel very good about the competitive position as we look forward, and I'm confident that we are poised to leverage those assets in 2011 to deliver superior performance for our customers, but also to drive higher returns for our shareholders. And I'll underscore what Fran said a couple minutes ago. We are a growth and a profitability company, and we're going to continue that track record. ", "As you see on this slide, I'm not sure it's widely appreciated how thoroughly those investments and those portfolios have really transformed our revenue profile over the last couple of years and differentiated us significantly from our competitors, both in the marketplace and from a shareholder perspective. If you look at these charts, from 2006, we've grown the revenue base from around $88 billion to $104 billion. And if you look underneath those top line numbers, we've really transformed that revenue base. Wireless has grown to more than 60% of our revenues, up from about 43% in 2006. ", "Now the two big drivers, obviously, the Alltel acquisition, but also the rapid growth of Wireless data revenues, and you saw that on some of Fran's charts. Wireless data and Wireless will now make up 20% of our total revenue, and as you saw in fourth quarter, growing it better than a 25% clip year-over-year. ", "You also saw from Fran together strategic Enterprise services and FiOS account for about 13% of our revenues, up from only 6% in 2006. And you saw both of those segments grew strongly in the fourth quarter. So that means legacy and other services account for just over a quarter of our revenue base, whereas in 2006, they were more than half. So in a very real sense, we've rebuilt Verizon around the growth markets of the future, based on a foundation of superior network that gives us, really, a set of platforms for innovation that I think is unprecedented in the industry. You have 3G and 4G Wireless. You have the Fiber base of FiOS. You have Fiber in the backbone. You've got a huge network of cloud and data centers around the globe that really provide those platforms. ", "Now our networks give us a strong strategic position that put us at the center of the trends that I believe are going to be driving growth in our industry for the next years to come. With our broadband presence across the U.S. and around the world, we're positioned to grow as the global economy improves. And I think we're all seeing predictions that that's going to be happening in 2011. Customers expect to be connected now wherever they are, and that's an expectation that's driving demand for mobility and broadband connectivity in the home. Video\u2019s evolving into an anytime anywhere service, and it's fueling that demand for increased speed and bandwidth on both the Wireline and the fixed side of the business. And businesses are shifting to security and secure IP and secure managed services. ", "Now that shift to IP and digital content and computing power are moving to the cloud, both business and consumer, by the way, which opens up another growth area for companies like Verizon that have integrated assets across the broader ecosystem. Now one of the real challenges in this anytime, anywhere world is that content flowing across global networks, again, both fixed and mobile, is increasingly in the form of video, which taxes the networks like never before. ", "You see some of the growth areas in this chart. Five hours spent watching video every day, dramatic increases in mobile and online viewing, increased demand for integrated, multiscreen experiences and connected devices, and enormous demands of video over the Internet, more than 90% of Internet traffic by 2014, most of which is going to be streaming. So again, Verizon's investments in bandwidth and capacity, both at the edge and in the backbone, have prepared us to be a leading player in this multiscreen marketplace. ", "So it starts with our global capabilities and the Internet backbone facilities. Thanks to the MCI acquisition of a few years ago, Verizon's a major provider of services on a global scale, with 180,000 customers around the world. That's in a world that's increasingly depending on transporting terabytes of video and data around the world to a wide array of devices. Our high-capacity global networks position us to accommodate that rapidly increasing demand. We have the Internet Backbone in 159 countries on six different continents. We have high-speed, undersea cables linking all the world's major markets. We have the most connected Internet Backbone network, we've been rated that way in 11 of the last 12 years. We're the first company to deliver commercial, long-haul service at 100 gigabytes per second. And we have over 200 data centers around the world that we can deploy to service the cloud demands. ", "We've also beefed up our capabilities and professional and strategic services through acquisitions, such as the security firm Cybertrust, which we purchased a couple of years ago. ", "Just as important to those physical assets, we've got 3,000 professional consultants in our digital business, whose expertise gives us a leg up on growing the market for these managed and intelligent services. Strategic services now combine more than 44% of our $15 billion in global enterprise revenues, and we're positioned for even faster growth as we move forward. ", "So finally, we have a great opportunity to extend our global reach and scale through our partnership with Vodafone, and that's a little bit of a change in strategy for us. In the past, this has really been largely a financial relationship with Vodafone. But now we're putting together a strategy and a structure to operationalize this partnership by aligning our technical roadmaps, by gaining efficiencies through procurement and by putting together unified account teams to handle the multinational, large enterprise corporations. ", "Now I think with the talent and resources of the two companies, there is much more that we can do to deliver superior experiences for our global customers and expand into higher growth vertical markets to again deliver greater value for our shareholders. ", "So the global presence positions us to be a big player in the next generation of computing as well. And where everything we do, media, communications, personal data, network intelligence, security protocols and many more will be stored in the Cloud and then delivered anywhere in the globe. This shift to an everything as a service model expands the addressable market for Verizon's global services dramatically. ", "Now experience tells us, as you see on this chart, every time we see a paradigm shift in computing, we see the number of users go up by a factor of 10. And industry analysts, like Gartner and IDC, size the cloud market at about 120 billion over the next five years, with a growth rate in the range of 20% a year. So with those 200 data centers I mentioned, with global IP backbone, with the service portfolio we have, we are better positioned, I believe, than just about anybody to capitalize on this fast growing market by delivering any content to any device anywhere in the world with all of the network quality and the reliability that our customers have come to associate with our brand. So in short, our assets put Verizon right in the center of the trends driving growth in our industry. ", "Now let me shift gears here for a second to FiOS. I talked a moment ago about the growing dominance of video on the Internet. Well, the optimum platform for handling that kind of bandwidth demand is Fiber, which is why we made the investment in FiOS when we started building back in 2004. Now we're approaching the end of our FiOS build. Over this last six years, we've completed reaching 15 million households. And when we complete our FiOS build of 18 million households, we'll cover about 70% of our territory. ", "This fast FiOS network can handle high volumes of streaming video and on-demand content, including 3D sports, games and entertainment. And recently, as some of you may know, we upped the ante by increasing our throughput speeds to 150 megabits per second, and that really sets a new benchmark in America for high-speed Internet access. In essence, we've used that FiOS investment to totally reinvent the consumer Wireline business around the growth markets of the future. It is a question we had a couple of minutes ago, now over 50% of our revenue, right? ", "So now, our focus and my focus is on driving that investment to deliver greater returns. Fran talked overall about the improving financials of the FiOS business, and I think it can generate a lot higher margins as we go forward and certainly, improve the composite margins and ARPUs that we see in the legacy products of the Wireline business. Customers have responded very strongly to the FiOS product, and we think 32% Internet penetration and 20% TV penetration gives us a lot of opportunity for upside growth. ", "Now we're also really excited about the opportunity FiOS brings to further transform the broadband experience and deliver a whole suite of broadband services for the home, and you saw a few of those in the back of the room earlier this morning. We see that fiber-connected home becoming the hub for managing all aspects of the customers' digital life. Now what's bringing this long predicted vision to life is the increasing number of connected devices in the home, combined with that high-speed connections and a flood of web-based content that needs to be managed. And when you layer on the social trends, like energy conservation, telework, environmental concerns, we see tremendous opportunity for companies that deliver a truly efficient, integrated, connected home solution. ", "Now with this platform for the future largely in place at this point, we can now focus on using it as that launchpad for the entry into new markets that will leverage that FiOS investment and expand and diversify the revenue stream of the Wireline business. And Fran touched briefly on that in the question-and-answer session. We've also spent, though, many years building the premier nationwide wireless platform for the anytime anywhere era. We've deliberately assembled our national footprint through a series of strategic transactions that you see on this chart that transformed us from regional players by combining GTE, Rural Cellular, PrimeCo, Vodafone, AirTouch, Alltel into the nationwide player that you see here over the last 15 years. And we've integrated all these separate companies into a seamless whole, establishing the country's leading Wireless brand. ", "Also in 2004, we ushered in the area of mobile data by launching our 3G Wireless network, which made us the largest, most reliable Wireless voice and data network in the U.S. Now since that time, we've doubled our 3G capacity every year, consistently investing in cell sites, spectrum and backhaul, and increasing our throughput speeds. We've bulked up our 3G capacity again in advance of our iPhone launch. Now I hope you all had a chance to look at the iPhone in the back of the room. I can tell you, I've been using this personally, and this is a terrifically performing device, and we expect great things of it as we add it to the network. So the 3G network has been and will continue to be a platform for innovation and technology driven growth. ", "Now we've accommodated the doubling of usage on our 3G network every year with no degradation of quality. We're the largest provider of Android products in the country, which in 2010 was the fastest-growing platform of any phones in the market. And we have the highest quality, most loyal customer base in the industry. And again, this was all before we added the great Apple products to our portfolio that you'll be seeing a lot more of in 2011. So again, we think 3G will continue to be a growth engine, not for just '11, but for several years to come. So now let's shift gears a bit. ", "At the same time, we've been actively preparing for the next generation of mobile broadband growth. In fact, I'd say we've been preparing for this over the last decade, as you see on this chart. Those of you more familiar with our industry know that spectrum really is the life blood of the Wireless business, and we've consistently added to our spectrum depth and breadth to ensure we have the capacity to meet this large consumer demand that we're seeing. ", "The key transaction was probably in 2007, when we purchased the nationwide spectrum in the 700MHz range, which paved our way for the investment in a superior 4G LTE network. As you see on this chart, we launched LTE in December in 38 major markets, home to 1/3 of all Americans. We'll double that in the next 18 months to some $200 million POPs and we'll blanket the country by the end of 2013. I believe LTE is a real game changer, and I don't use that term loosely, because it increased speeds on our network by a factor of 10 and cuts latency in half, which is the piece that many people miss. That makes it suitable for two-way video traffic, real-time applications, cloud computing and all the other mobile broadband experiences that are going to dominate in this anytime, anywhere world that we talked about. And riding that 700MHz spectrum, it has significantly better in building penetration than other so-called 4G technologies. And it dramatically enhances the value proposition that we can bring to customers. ", "Now customers are already beginning to see the benefits of LTE. Those of you have been around a while, remember the old they won't come, there\u2019s not going to be any devices, well I think at CES, we announced a suite of consumer-oriented Smart phone tablets and devices for 4G from several manufacturers. We're also working actively with developers and entrepreneurs from across the high-tech industry to expand the market by further developing a robust LTE ecosystem. Our partnership with Google around the Android platform is just one example. And if you happen to be at CES and you went by our booth, we showcased more than 40 devices from 60 different developers, and that was the range from game players to cars to smart energy to meters to healthcare devices. And through the open development initiative, we're working with more than 6,000 developers to help integrate their applications and software onto LTE. Collaboration is how growth and innovation will happen in the Wireless market in the future. And we believe our commitment to network innovation, our spectrum position and all of our other blended assets make us the preferred partner for such efforts. ", "All of this, I think, will speed up the innovation cycle, and it will position us for growth from a number of areas. First, a diversified portfolio of devices. We're seeing all major manufacturers and platforms are represented. We're going to see increased Smart phone penetration.26% today, I think we'll be at 50% by the end of 2011, or even higher. I think we're going to see increased ARPU from mobile data and video. We're going to see new revenue streams from innovations now just beginning to come to the market, like machine-to-machine. So I think we're ready for this coming mobile broadband era, and we're excited about the opportunity to kick start another growth cycle in an already vibrant sector of our business. ", "Now the real magic happens when you put all of this together. You've got LTE, you've got Fiber in the network, you've got Fiber in the Backbone, you've got global IP networks, you've got all the different devices and apps and interactive content being developed to deliver experiences more powerful than anything we've seen to date. And with video and data comprising the bulk of the traffic on mobile and broadband networks, we have a tremendous opportunity to optimize the flow of content across LTE and FiOS to deliver those integrated services to customers wherever they are. ", "Now our Flex View product, again, I hope you saw it in the back of the room, is an early glimpse at this content anywhere world, what that will look like. And as you see on this chart, our foundation of what I call high IQ networks and that massive Cloud infrastructure gives us growth opportunities across every one of our businesses. There aren't many providers who can take the customer from their home to work and everywhere in between, wherever they are in the world, and we're one of that select group. And we really believe those high IQ networks are the hub of the wheel that will drive the industry forward. So the assets I've just described give Verizon that unmatched strategic position in the growth markets of the future. ", "Now my focus is on leveraging those superior assets to deliver superior value to our customers and to our investors. In my mind, these aren't separate goals, but they rather exist in a dynamic relationship, that virtuous cycle of investment, execution, growth, profitability in which success in one area feeds and is therefore fed by all of the others. Well, that's why I've challenged the leadership team around Verizon to execute around this model to deliver growth and profitability. So first, consistent investment starts with having the right tools in the toolbox. So we'll continue to allocate capital to growth platforms, systems, technologies and product sets. ", "Second, we have to have strong portfolio management. As we've done in the past, we'll continue to actively manage our portfolio to add strategic capabilities through selective M&A, where we can and where necessary, and we'll exit nonstrategic businesses as well. ", "Third, operating excellence. We need to deliver on the power of our assets through fundamental execution, operating at maximum efficiency and providing customer interactions that live up to the promise of our superior networks. ", "Fourth, we're going to defend and extend our market position. We have aggressive business plans for competing in the marketplace, growing revenue and taking market share. And as we do that, we'll generate profits, and that cash will allow us to keep investing and turning that wheel of this virtuous cycle. ", "Now in my time at Verizon Wireless, we had a strong history of execution around profitable growth. And I come into this new position with the same expectation. Anyone who's worked with me for any length of time has heard my philosophy that no matter how good you're doing, how successful you are in others' eyes, there's always opportunity to do better. We call it our higher gear philosophy. And I'm absolutely convinced when it comes to delivering that value for our customers and shareholders, we can raise our game even further in the next several years. Our team is focused on instilling the culture and the incentives across the business to drive performance and execute that game plan that I've laid out for you today. We are very confident that superior execution will lead to superior returns for our shareholders. ", "Now I know you want to understand how does that translate into the numbers. So I'm going to bring Fran back up at this point to talk about our targets for 2011 and beyond. Thank you.", "Francis Shammo", "Thanks, Lowell. Okay, so now we'll move to the, just the guidance that I think everybody showed up to hear today. So first, let me just talk about, you heard Lowell talk all about the strategic nature of where we're headed. Let me just tell you where my focus is going to be. Obviously, driving profitable top line growth. As Lowell said, we're going to continue to invest and allocate capital to those growth areas that we have in our platforms, enhance the return on invested capital. I've seen a lot of articles written about the telcos and the invested capital. This is a real concentration for me to make sure that we start to return on what we invest in from a growth platform prospective. ", "Obviously, generating free cash flow, maintaining our dividend policy and returning to our shareholders. Let's go to the next slide. So if we look at revenue, so from an overall perspective, there's a few things that are flowing into the revenue projection. One, service revenue, 7.7% growth this year. Obviously, we believe that there's more growth there for next year. Data revenue, 26% penetration. If you paid attention to Lowell's charts, we believe there will be 50% plus by the end of 2012, with all of the devices that we're bringing to the market, both 3G and 4G. Smart phone penetration, as I said, and then, of course LTE, just in a matter of three weeks again, 65,000 adds, which were 44% new to Verizon. ", "On a consumer side, we have FiOS growing 10.7% in ARPU year-over-year on a consumer basis, $146 per sub, grew 4% this year. With the launch of Flex View, as I said, 2,000 titles, we sold 45,000 of them in just a matter of six weeks. So there's more potential from the Flex View as we continue to add titles and also, as we continue to add TV programs that will be able to be bought through Flex View. ", "Then on Enterprise, overall strategic services grew 7.5%. We see that continuing to escalate as the macroeconomics, if it stays where it is today, if we get any bump in the economy, that will, of course, drive GDP, which will then enhance the Enterprise services side. And then of course, you heard Lowell talk about Cloud. And you're going to see us move into the Cloud space in a very big way in 2011. And we'll talk more about as the quarters go on, but you can expect us to do more growth in the Cloud arena. So when you take all of that, to combined with the launch of the iPhone, 4% to 8% growth for next year on top line revenue. ", "Let's go to the next one, please. This is the fun chart I have. So the fun chart is don't ask me anymore how long am I going to sustain 47% margin. This is a chart that shows, as Lowell said, it's all about execution and profitability on the Wireless side. And I think we have proven that through the history of where we are. So from that perspective, let's just move on to the next topic. ", "From an overall perspective, I think it's all about how do we prepare for the iPhone launch. So on the iPhone launch, when we talk about execution, refer back to the last slide. We are not going to have any flaws on the execution of the iPhone launch. The next is, if we go to customer service, we've hired over 3,000 people currently, who have been trained.  And if you think about it, we launched the iPad, so that our customer service reps in our stores and in our centers could get used to the interface of the iPhone, which was a pre-launch to the iPhone. So we've trained everyone, extensive training around that. Then when we go into just overall, if you could put those four slides back up on the iPhone, please. ", "So if we go to the overall network. We've been preparing the network for expansion for the last year, anticipating the launch of the iPhone. So we are well-prepared from a network prospective. And then from a policy change, there are a number of policy changes that are taking effect. So one is, we have discontinued the new every two for new customers. Now that doesn't mean that our current base is not qualified to exercise their new every two right. They are. But for new customers, there will no longer be any more new every two. So if you think about that, you can do the math, but before you would get a $50 to $100 credit going forward on any upgrade, that disappears. The customer will be getting the promotional price at that point in time for a new phone when they qualify. ", "Second, we are changing our return policy from 30 days to 14 days, and even at 14 days, it's still one of the best in the industry. And then most recently, you'll hear more about this in the coming days, but we are launching a trade-in program. We have entered into an agreement with a third-party, where we will be taking trade-ins from anyone who wants to bring us a trade-in phone. They will be getting a credit from the third-party participant, and then we will welcome them into any device that they choose on the Verizon Wireless network. ", "So if you go to the next slide, please. So from a Wireline overall efficiency, I think we've shown that with our FiOS growth, 53% of the revenue is consumer and strategic services, 44% is global, part of the global enterprise space. Overall, consumer access, as I said, is less than 7% of the overall revenue, and we believe there will be Cloud acceleration in 2011. In addition, we will continue to drive the cost reductions within Wireline. We will continue to drive the synergies through VSO on real estate, energy, access costs. So with all that said, I think that we are comfortable saying, as I've said in the past, we continue to see margin expansion in our Wireline unit. ", "If we go to the next slide, please. So from a capital perspective, Wireline capital, as we've said, we have reallocated capital very efficiently this year. So if you look at the Wireline segment, our capital expenditures went down by $1.7 billion. That was reallocated back into Wireless. So Wireless increased by $2 billion, which was really the preface of building capacity on EVDO for anticipation of the iPhone usage and building out our LTE network. ", "So from a guidance standpoint on capital for 2011, you could expect it to be flat or slightly down from 2010 performance. But again, I think it's critical that there will be a major reallocation again in 2011 between where that capital is invested, as both Lowell and I said, it will be invested in the growth platforms of the business. If we go to the next slide, please. So from an EPS earnings per share relevancy. But first, before I get there, I think there's a few things that we need to talk about. ", "So there's a lot of things that go into projecting an earnings per share for a company. It's not just about an iconic device of the iPhone and what the impact of that's going to be. So if you think about everything that we've talked about here today, the revenue growth in all the segments that Lowell and I have talked about; if you talk about the cost reductions across the board, both in Wireless, Wireline and corporate; if you think about the capital efficiency, the cash management efficiency we have, the pension and op-ed planning that we've done, and just to remind everyone, on Friday, I said that all the changes that we made, the pension and op-ed expense, will be zero to slightly positive for 2011. ", "Now going to the iPhone. If you think about this, there are a lot of things going in to projecting what the iPhone volume could be. So one, it's all about supply. Two, it's the mix of sales versus upgrades. Three, it's about what is our projection going to be. So I'm probably going to disappoint everyone, but I'm not going to give you an exact forecast that Verizon has for the iPhone because there's too many variables that go into this. So what I've done is I've taken the consensus average, which is 11 million phones, we've put that into the model, and given everything else that Verizon's going to do in 2011 based on 11 million units of the iPhone, you will get a 5% to 8% EPS accretion in 2011. ", "Now sensitivity around that is if I do more than 11 million units, then obviously, I'll be on the low side. If I do many more than 11 million units, I may actually fall outside of this range. But I think the important thing here is whatever this 5% to 8% will be based on the units, and obviously, we'll inform that as we go through the year, it just means that much more upside for 2012. So when you think about this, 2x is not out of the range for a number for 2012 based on these projections of 11 million units. So you'll be hearing more about that as we go from quarter-to-quarter, but that is more or less the consensus that we have today. ", "If you go to the next, please. From a shareholder return perspective, obviously, the concentration that Lowell and I have is to continue to return to our shareholders what they expect from us, which is growth in the share price and maintain our dividend policy. ", "Next slide, please. So overall, I think you've heard from Lowell and I, I'm not going to repeat everything on this slide, it's just a regeneration of what we just talked about. But I think you can tell that Lowell and I are both focused on delivering what we need to deliver. So at this point, I'm going to go ask Ivan and Lowell to rejoin me back up here on stage, and I'm going to open it up to the floor for Q&A.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Nancy?", "Unidentified Analyst", "The 2x you just mentioned in 2012, what did that refer to? You said 2x wouldn't be unreasonable in 2012?", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Based on a 4% to 8% projection, 2x that rate.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then second of all, if you could talk about the sort of ARPU subscribers\u2019 growth rate and the top line in Wireless in 2011 and then versus Wireline in 2011, how you break up the business on the top line versus that guidance?", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Well, I'm not going to give guidance on specific top line growth for there. So we'll stay at the 4% to 8% on total revenue guidance for the corporation.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "Just one clarification, the 2x is really related to, when you were talking to the earnings slide, correct?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, 2x on the earnings slide.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "So the EPS 2011 number, we are talking two times of what we had on that slide. Not the revenue numbers, for specifics.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Earnings growth in 2012 looked more like 8% to 16% off of the 2011 base, something like that. Just on the Wireline side, you talked about all the drivers and the wholesale being a bare one. Is it possible that you think you could get to Wireline growth, obviously not for the year, but maybe by the end of the year or potentially in 2012?", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, so John, I think, as I said, the biggest driveway now is the wholesale side. So on the consumer side, you have growth from FiOS. On the enterprise side, you have growth. So it's really the wholesale side. And I think that as we get through the third quarter on the international traffic situation, I think you'll see some improvement there. Mike Milligan, who's the President of our wholesale, believes that there are, through the Fiber to the Cell program that we have, through Ethernet that we have, they actually grew 6.6% year-over-year within that segment. So as we continue to see some of the decline in the voice side, I do feel that there could be a potential. If the economy stays steady and we get some growth in the economy and wholesale comes back, we could be back to a growth in the overall segment.", "Lowell McAdam", "And John, I think I had to add to that -- I think there's some good, let's say, let's call it earnings potential on the core side as well. I see lots of opportunities to take more cost out just by being more efficient, not just on the labor side, but more efficient on how we provision, how we maintain, so we have fewer dispatches on that side. And as you and I were talking earlier, we've seen a slight decrease in the disconnect side on the core. And if we can keep the quality and the expense in a good position there, I think we can improve overall profitability of the core.", "John Doherty", "[Operator Instructions] I'm going to go over to Jonathan Chaplin with Nancy.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So a quick question for Fran. I think you mentioned you expected 50% Smart phone penetration by the end of 2011. That's a doubling from where it is at the moment. And I expect it goes higher than that in 2012. It should drive a very significant increase in postpaid ARPU. With that in mind and how accretive to margins that increase in ARPU is, why aren't you expecting more in terms of earnings growth between now and 2012?", "Francis Shammo", "Well, I mean, again, I think you have to look at the holistic picture. But obviously, it's because of the iPhone and the subsidy on the iPhone.", "Unidentified Analyst", "So, I would expect that to be a big pressure in 2011. And so maybe you don't see that EPS growth in 2011. But as you go through to 2012, it's with all the iPhone subscribers that you add in 2011 and the impact that has on ARPU, I would've expected a bigger jump than 10% to 16% in earnings.", "Francis Shammo", "Well, at this point, what I said was under the assumption of the 11 million units, you could factor in at 2x. But at the end of the day, I'm not giving guidance on '12 because I don't know yet what the total volume will be in '11.", "Lowell McAdam", "We've got a couple of, I think, significant moving pieces here. Obviously, the iPhone is one of them. But if you take a look at the 4G devices that we've got outside, I mean, they are terrific devices. And the tablets that go along with those, we're working very hard with lots of different developers to bring new applications. I mean, there's a lot of upside. And I can tell you, later this afternoon, Ivan and I will meet with the employees, and we'll be talking a lot more than 50%. But I think we've got to be very careful that we guide you in a prudent and conservative way, and that's kind of where we are at this point.", "John Doherty", "Why don't we go over to Simon?", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "I think you mentioned, Lowell, about depending on iPhone supply. Can you just give us some clarity around that? Is this a situation where you're going to have some significant backorders in the February, March period? And then the obligatory Verizon Wireless Vodafone dividend question, what's the latest on that? What's the timing we should think about there?", "Lowell McAdam", "Those two questions are interesting bedfellows, I have to say. So on the supply side, you all see the different forecast. And we've spent a lot of time with Steve and Tim, talking about what we might expect, not only existing iPhone subscribers, but there's a lot of people on other networks that are interested in that device on the Verizon network. So from that part, you could be wildly optimistic or you could be conservative. Now you also have to factor in, you remember last year, we ended up with a shortage of screens and some of the basic components because as we started to come out of a little bit of a downturn. So our hesitancy to give you a strong number on supply is just we don't know whether we'll be able -- the demand is very variable and some of the components are variable. But we feel very good on hitting the kind of numbers that Fran talked to you about. Now on Vodafone, I think I need to reemphasize that trying to change this from a pure financial partnership to an operating partnership. If you look back over the last 11 years, our technologies were so far apart, it made it difficult to sort of reach across the aisle and do a lot of things together. Well, they've launched LTE in Germany. Obviously, we've launched LTE. We see now, especially when you look at all the things I talked about on the asset side, that them working with us from not only just Wireless, but from the business side, really is a competitive advantage for both of us. Now we've said over the years that eventually, we'll be into a place where we'll be giving a dividend. To me, they contributed the assets. We knew this day was coming. It'll be a fair dividend. We'll get their support for making additional investments in the business. That's the key for us, is to keep Verizon Wireless very healthy. And if there's excess cash on that, then we'll dividend it out and Fran will use some for our investments across the business and Victoria will use some. But I think that as we get to the end of this year, we'll sit down and we'll talk about it in the board, and we'll figure out what a fair and reasonable dividend is.", "John Doherty", "Why don't we go over to Jason?", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just one follow-up. I guess one of the key inputs is around iPhones, of where they're coming from. And if the consensus is 11 million units, can you help us think through in percentage terms, is it more weighted towards external? Is it internal Smart phone upgrades, which I guess you're doubling Smart phone percentage, which suggests it's not. Or is it existing feature phone upgrades? Maybe help us think through that.", "Francis Shammo", "I think a couple of important facts here, Jason. One is if you look at our current base today, 52% of that base is on feature phones with no data plan. There's another 15% on multi-video type devices, which only had a $10 data plan at that time, which you know now, we have discontinued that line. So within our own base, there are 67% of the people who can upgrade and bring more ARPU with them. So if you think about a feature phone customer going to a Smart phone, the ARPU on that is 2x what they deliver on a feature phone. So I think it's important because I don't know exactly what the mix will be at this point in time. But I think it is important to know there is tremendous growth within our own base by moving that base to Smart phones, whether it be an iPhone or a DROID or some other device. So I think as you think through that, I think you have to look at the overall base, plus what would be coming in from new.", "John Doherty", "I'm going to go to Jim Peshek. Question from the back.", "James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital", "Jim Ratcliffe, Barclays Capital. Two questions. Quickly, Fran, did I hear you say that you won't be offering the $15 data plan for iPhone customers?", "Francis Shammo", "The $15 promotional price that was offered will be discontinued at the end of this month.", "James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital", "You've chosen to take legal action to push back against the FCC's net neutrality proposals. How do you see those affecting the business, whether those proposals actually take effect or not, and particularly regarding applications like Flex View?", "Ivan Seidenberg", "I don't think it'll affect it at all. I think the FCC decision, kind of a far-reaching one. I think that most of the impact of that order won't be felt this year. But over the longer term, it would be felt if the FCC actually exercised all the authority. Just for a point, if you actually read the rules they put into effect, the rules don't sound anywhere near as troublesome as the order, which is encourages the FCC to seek broader authority over time. So I don't think it'll have any effect on the current business, but I do believe that longer term, we need to challenge the expansion of the FCC's authority there. Since I have the floor, let me just add a point to the last couple of questions on this guidance question. Fran and Lowell tried to give you as much guidance as we can. There's a couple of unknowns here. But I think it's worth just slowing it down a little bit. So we can get into this contest of, so we think we know how many people will switch from T to us. We don't really know the answer to that. We know you're being subjected to lots of discussion around that. We do believe that our brand and our network will drive a lot of people. But so Jonathan, to your point about what will earnings look like in the future, why don't you do this. Over the next couple of quarters, as we get some experience on volumes, we'll share with you what those results look like, and I think you'll get a better view. It's much better than overestimating something that we don't know. The other point is that we also believe that all our strategies will frankly lift the whole industry. So, yes, this is about us today. But I think that as all these 4G and 3G devices get out there, you will find all of the carriers doing better. Our view is we'll do better because of the position we've established, but the entire base is going to move from feature phones up to Smart phones over the course of the next 12 months. So I think you're sitting in a really good spot when we look at the entire industry growth. And obviously, we believe we'll have an edge on that. So I think when you look at these numbers, my advice is be careful about '11, and '12 and '13 will absolutely be clear to you once you get to the middle of the year.", "John Doherty", "Chris?", "Christopher Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Chris Larsen from Piper Jaffray. Fran, can you talk a little bit about the optimal capital structure and within that, not just at the corporate level, but also the Wireless level. Going back to the dividend question, arguably the Wireless business will be under-levered if it was a stand-alone business. Do you think about it as a stand-alone business when you think about that capital structure? And then do you think maybe it makes sense to lever that up and then cash that out to the parents? And then what is the proper leverage ratio for Verizon? And then a second question, as you look at the last 30% of your access lines that aren't going to have FiOS, what's the long-term strategy for those access lines?", "Francis Shammo", "So I'll take the capital and maybe I'll have Lowell take the long-term strategy on the access lines for the LTE. But on the capital structure, I think the way we look at it, is as we've said, we're going to continue to de-lever. So that de-lever will happen in the Wireless unit. I am not going to lever up just to distribute cash to the parents. That's not going to happen. But I'm also not going to build cash in Wireless either. As Lowell spoke about, when the time comes, we'll start to deliver cash to the share owners. So I think that's how you have to look at this. But overall, we will continue to manage our capital structure. We will continue to manage our debt levels and refinancing and position, taking advantage of some of that better interest rates in the marketplace. And we will continue to do all that. But I think, as we said, our target for EBITDA to debt ratio, we are at 1.3 today, and we will continue to de-lever that.", "Lowell McAdam", "So on the core in the 30% that's less. Let me tell you, my priorities, first, are to get better penetration on FiOS. Every customer I talk to, investors, you name it, if they've had FiOS, they've used FiOS, they go holy cats. I didn't think there was a difference. There is a difference, and they love it. So I've got to go back to what we did with Verizon Wireless in the beginning, when all the carriers were viewed the same and we came up with the can you hear me now campaign, and people really appreciated reliability. We're going to find that message so that we can get penetration up. When you get penetration up, the profitability changes, so that equation may change as well. Now we're also going to, as I said earlier, work on the basic profitability of that 30% to try to make that better. If we can sustain it, and I think we have a tendency and I think all of you have the tendency to sort of write things off very early on. If we get to the point where we do those two things and it doesn't make sense for us, then we'll look at additional dispositions. It depends on where the properties are and that sort of thing. So I'm not ruling out anything. But my number one priority is to make FiOS more profitable and stabilize the other core assets.", "John Doherty", "Let's go over to Kevin Smithen?", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research", "Fran, do you think this revenue growth is sustainable for a few years? And you gave a lot of different metrics on the Wireless data front. Could you maybe talk about what the penetration right now is of your subscriber base that have a data plan and maybe what the average ARPU of that data plan is? And related to that, somewhat, I know it's complex, but do you think Wireless broadband can start to cannibalize Wireline broadband, given the speeds and maybe the capacity upgrades you see in the next couple of years?", "Francis Shammo", "So from a guidance perspective, I'm not going to get into that detail of the guidance between what the ARPU growth will be. And I mean, what we say is we're at 26% penetration on data today, we'll be at 50% plus. Data revenue is 2x that of a feature customer. So that's where we're at. As far as cannibalization from LTE, I think what you have to look at is I don't think that the broadband connection to the home with the speeds that are being enabled at 150 megabits per second through FiOS, that's going to go away. I think that given the amount of content that will be put into that home, I don't think that will be a displacement for broadband connection. However, I do believe that when you get out into the rural areas, there's going to be some opportunities. And I'll pass it to Lowell, he can talk about the DIRECTV relationship and what we've done there.", "Lowell McAdam", "Well, we've got a couple of things. We've licensed our 700MHz in some of the very rural markets that we weren't going to get to for a while to the rural carriers, so that they could get that infrastructure up and operating. And as Fran mentioned, we've got a number of trials with DIRECTV where we have bundled, we've got a special antenna that we've developed together, but we've bundled the video service together with a high-speed Internet access service. And that, again, works very well in the rural markets. So there's ways to get in there. My view is over time, if I look over my years, the Wireless will sort of nibble away at the low end of the Wireline offering. But it's very difficult to beat a dedicated facility into somebody's house. And certainly, it's not on any roadmap I've seen where we're going to hit a 150 megabytes in a broad Wireless deployment.", "John Doherty", "[Operator Instructions] Let's go with Michael, and then we'll go over to David.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "A couple of questions. First in the Wireline side, management earlier last year, pointed out, I think, a $1.5 billion plus goal for cost cutting through the end of 2011. Can you give us an update in terms of where you are along that road map? And then secondly, Ivan, earlier this past month, talked about changes in management compensation that Fran made. And I was wondering if you could detail a little bit more, maybe about how some of the high-level goals or strategies for incentive compensation were changed?", "Francis Shammo", "So addressing the cost savings program. We, with the $1.5 billion, I don't remember that figure, quite honestly. But from running the operating unit during the year, we obviously achieved a significant reduction of employees. We closed over 7 million square feet of real estate, we either sold it or closed it or subleased it. We have significantly reduced the cost, as I said before, from a FiOS perspective. We have gotten more efficient as we have gone on. So I think at the end of the day, we achieved what we said we would achieve, which was we were going to expand the Wireline margin, which we did. And I think going into next year, as Lowell has said, that is going to be the consistent strategy going forward. From just an overall compensation standpoint, as Ivan had mentioned, we moved more risk to cash flow away from revenue. And obviously, you can see from the charts, the revenue growth is not going to be really quite an issue, but we have to make sure that we generate the cash flow at the bottom, both in the Wireline unit and the Wireless unit.", "John Doherty", "David?", "David Barden", "Lowell or Fran, could you talk about this, again, this 26% to 50-plus percent Smart phone evolution. In the base today, if 25% are Smart phones, those guys are generating $80, which means that the other 75% are generating $40. And so your game plan is to take a big portion of those people who pay $40 today and turn them into $80s over the course of the year, that's a lot of money for the next 25% to 50% of the base in terms of their income and getting them up the curve. So could you kind of talk a little bit about how you really make that happen because it seems like a very aspirational goal. And I guess my second question, if I could, Ivan, you announced that Lowell would be your successor last year. Could you talk a little bit about how you see your succession plan evolving this year in 2011?", "Francis Shammo", "So you consider, you think the 50% is conservative? I just want to make sure -- I mean, I get what you said about the future phone, I'll get to that. But your belief is the 50% is conservative?", "David Barden", "Well, no, the question is to get from 26% penetration of people paying you $80 to 50% penetration of people paying you something much more than the $40 they're paying you now, you've really got to create either a much lower cost of entry or bridge them somehow from an economic standpoint because it seems like the first 30% of America is paying $100 or $80 for a Smart phone, no problem. The next 25% of Americans are going to have a bigger problem coming up with that wallet and how do you get them there.", "Lowell McAdam", "We can talk about this for a while here. That is, I would say, is right if you looked at the entire base of Wireless customers in the U.S. But remember, over the last 10 years, we have gone for that high-end customer and their families. And what we see, when we bring out a great phone like the DROID, and I expect it's going to happen exactly that way with the iPhone, is we pull a lot of family share lines with them. Now in the past, those were $9 lines. In the future, they're going to have the $39 or whatever our data package is associated with those. And what we see is once people get those phones in their hand, they say, \"I can live with a flip phone.\" We tease Ivan, he still carries a flip phone once in a while. But when they get those Smart phones in their hands, the usage goes up, they get on the unlimited plans or they move up in tiers. So I actually feel good about, and when Fran shared some of his charts, having those feature phone customers moving up with the set of devices we have and the clientele we have, I don't see that as a big problem.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "So let me just add to that. So part of your question is you assume the available discretionary income for Wireless is fixed. That's what your question was. We assume that even if you're half right, there are other things that will drive people to use Wireless products, medical services, going green. The business revenues will significantly increase as you go to data because people will have more work at home. We have customers, we have large companies coming to us. We have one large one who've said to us, \"We want every employee to work out of home.\" And so I think there's an opportunity to take this data platform and extend it to parallel industries and so the revenue pie we're looking into is much bigger than the one that you think exist today. So not only will those $40 customers become higher data users, but the $80 customers will go to $105 and $110. The other thing we've missed in this discussion is, I've been saying this, that my guess is that at least half this audience today is carrying two devices on them. Two years ago, you guys would say that can never happen, and half of you now have two devices. Our view is when you get to machine-to-machine and all these other things, they're going to find people carrying three and four devices. So I don't subscribe to the theory that the pie remains static. So I think that answers part of your question. Now the succession plan is based on what I just said being true, which is, that if we are really looking at this expansion of the pie and we take these two great guys, when you think about succession, you call up Madison Avenue, you got to get one guy with white hair and one guy that's angry all the time. So that's what we have. We have one guy that's white hair and one guy that\u2019s angry all the time. And so our board is in a place where they've asked me to work with Fran and Lowell through this year. Sometime, I've said this before, sometime in the second half of the year, Lowell will become CEO, and I'll spend a few more months after that as probably chair or whatever the board wants. And by the end of the year, we'll have the transition completed. Most of you know, transitions have a lot of components to them. Running your company, meeting your outside stakeholders, partners, politics, boards, investors. So we're working through all of that. Today is part of that drill. Hopefully, you saw a plan today from two people that have a very expansive view of the future and a really sound, solid record of execution. So I think for me, this is an easy transition. But there's still a few things that need to be done between now and the end of the year, and we'll get them done.", "John Doherty", "Why don't we go to Kevin with Kevin?", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie Research", "Kevin Smithen with Macquarie. Equally impressive to your 872,000 net adds this quarter was the 9% retail postpaid upgrades to Smart phones and the 63% new to category, I think, bodes well for your 50% Smart phone targets. The question is with all of the hoopla surrounding the iPhone launch, you obviously had very, very strong momentum on Android and BlackBerry in Q4. How do you keep that momentum with the iPhone launch and continue to drive success in all of your Smart phones in 2011?", "Francis Shammo", "Well, I think you saw that in the back of the room, the 4G device lineups we have from major manufacturers are terrific devices. So the iPhone sort of establishes its own gravitational pull. But if you look at the CES show and how much attention we got around LTE, and you look at the breadth of those devices, I really feel good. And we frankly worked very hard to get here as that we would have a balanced approach. One thing we said we would never allow ourselves to do is to become a one phone company. And we're a portfolio company, and I think we've positioned ourselves that way. And what the message I was trying to send earlier today is that portfolio is also broad when you look at the Enterprise side, the FiOS side and the Wireless side. So we won't be one business focused and we certainly won't be one device focused.", "John Doherty", "Let's go one more. Last one.", "Unidentified Analyst", "No one has talked about this, so maybe it is a good one. Enterprise. To what extent is Enterprise outlook for 2011, 2012 really just about the economy recovering? And to what extent, you talk about Cloud, it seems to be on the top of everyone's mind, but I don't quite get the contribution that Cloud's going to make any time soon. Is there a J-curve investment? So could one of you address the issue with respect to the outlook for Enterprise, talk about Cloud, the economy, and as lastly, is Vodafone synergies built into any numbers that you've put out there for 2011, 2012?", "Lowell McAdam", "Fran can take the synergy side. I mean, we do see lots of opportunity with Vodafone around procurement and hitting these accounts, but Fran can talk about the numbers. So Enterprise. No, I think it's much more than just the economy. Certainly, the economy will help, but as you see the different applications, and Cloud is a very interesting thing. Everybody's talking about it. But what we find, what I find interesting is you sit down with a customer and you start to have a security discussion. The Cybertrust is usually where we start the discussion. They've got things that they want to get out on the mobile network. They're very concerned about the security of it. We bring the Peter Tippett and the team in, and we do the discussion and then it turns into, well, now you can store that application for me on your Cloud and deliver it around the world. So I think that the economy certainly will help, but I think some of those applications will get us up that curve very quickly, I think, quicker than we think.", "Francis Shammo", "Then the answer to the question on synergies, no, there is nothing baked into the plan.", "John Doherty", "And with that, we're going to bring it to a close with Ivan, making a few closing remarks.", "Ivan Seidenberg", "So thank you very much. I thought I would make just two or three closing points that will address some of your questions and put a bridge between what we've tried to do this morning and where you guys are. One of the things we wanted to do this morning was to establish a good foundation for our performance in 2010 and let you understand that we feel good about the fact that the beginning of the year, we didn't think the year would turn out as strong as it did at the end of the year, and there were some reasons why you've heard that and you could see clearly the difference that Lowell and Fran are making on the focus on execution in the company to make that happen. ", "What we wanted to do with the iPhone in 2011 is pretty simple. So to put this in perspective for those of you who are into conspiracies and into looking for other meaning to life, so you would think that this is my last year, so I would want to make sure that the year went smoothly. I also wanted to make sure my colleagues didn't overpromise and get in the doghouse for the next two or three years. So I've purposely made sure that whatever they told you this morning represented a fairly conservative but doable plan. So the issue for the iPhone is we don't have all the answers. We personally believe we'll probably do better than most people think, but we didn't want to set any standard because we don't know the number of people who'll move for it, we're not sure what the inventory flows will be, we're not really sure of how all that will time out, but we are sure, by the time we get to the end of the year, 2012 will look a lot stronger than 2011. ", "So we've told you everything we know, and that's kind of where we are at this point. We also wanted to make sure that when you think about the whole company, you don't just focus on the iPhone, but you look at the breadth of the assets that we have and the opportunities that we have to build the company. ", "Probably the most important issue I'll close on is for 2011. There\u2019s a lot of stuff written about earnings for 2011 will slide backwards because of the iPhone as opposed to going forward. Hopefully, you got this morning a sense from management that we're not accepting the idea that because we get a new iconic device in the system, that's an excuse for us to reduce our focus on growing the base in 2011. So we're going to work really hard to do that. Part of that, Fran drove this, he changed compensation for people to say don't ride on the fact we know we're going to have higher revenues because of the growth of FiOS and the growth of Smart phones. So he made sure our management understands that driving more EBITDA growth this year is a really important issue. So I think the company is positioned in a good place. ", "I also would make the comment again, just so you get a sense of this, I also think the entire industry is going to do better. I'm not trying to help the other, my colleagues in their assessment, but what I want to make sure is that you understand we believe the investments we've made, some of the investments they're making, will grow the pie. We happen to think we\u2019ll index better than they will, but the fact is, the overall pie for the susceptible growth. I want to thank Fran and Lowell, of course, and John for what they've done.

[Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our First Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking, and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. ", "Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to a newly formatted financial and operating information file that we've made available to you on our website. In addition to providing two years and eight quarters of historical financial information, we've added some new customer and connection metrics in Wireless and Wireline, which better reflect the trends in our business. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran Shammo.", "Francis Shammo", "Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. At our investor meeting in late January, we talked about our 2011 priorities, our strong focus on business plan execution and translating revenue opportunities into profitable growth and shareowner value. In looking at our first quarter results, I'd say we are off to a very strong start.  Our Wireless business performed extremely well, further solidifying our leadership position in the industry. Our 4G LTE network deployment is going very well, and our network performance has exceeded even our own very high expectations. In one independent test after another, our network's ability to deliver video and data, with exceptional speed and performance, has been unmatched. Possibly even more impressive is the speed with which products and services are being developed for LTE.  Through our LTE rollout, we have positioned ourselves on the leading edge of a whole new phase of Wireless market development. ", "Our first quarter Wireless results once again demonstrate our ability to effectively manage growth and sustain profitability. We had a very strong quarter of device sales, with 906,000 retail postpaid customer net additions. In a period of less than eight weeks, we activated 2.2 million iPhones and in two weeks, we activated more than 260,000 of our first 4G LTE smartphone, the HTC ThunderBolt, at the premium price of $249.99.", "In addition, we added about 250,000 4G Internet devices to our retail postpaid base in the quarter, and quickly sold out iPad 2 tablets in early March. So we built good momentum throughout the quarter. Our Wireless service EBITDA margin of 43.7% is a solid result, once again demonstrates our ability to effectively manage the customer acquisition and retention costs associated with gaining market share and increasing smartphone penetration, while sustaining our industry-leading profitable growth profile going forward.", "In Wireline, our first quarter results showed continued improvement on the top line, with sequential EBITDA margin expansion for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our improved year-over-year performance was driven by continued strength in FiOS and lower line loss rates, resulting in consumer revenue growth of 1.9%, as well as accelerated growth of 12.8% in Enterprise Strategic Services revenue.", "In terms of cost management, while the first quarter had some seasonal pressures, we did realize the cost benefits of our 16,000 workforce reductions from last year. On the strategic front, we closed the Terremark acquisition on April 11, and significantly improved our competitive position in the rapidly evolving managed hosting and cloud services space. ", "With these highlights as a backdrop, let's begin a more detailed review of the quarter on Slide 4, starting with a look at consolidated results. Consolidated revenue growth in the first quarter accelerated to 5.3% year-over-year, up sharply from 2.3% growth in the fourth quarter. Total revenue growth in Wireless increased to 10.2%. And while much of this growth was driven by equipment sales in this quarter, we do expect to see future benefit from these sales in subsequent quarters in terms of higher recurring revenue streams. So top line growth is what we expected, and we were on track to meet our full-year revenue guidance of between 4% and 8% annual growth.", "Our consolidated EBITDA for the first quarter totaled $8.5 billion, up 3.8% year-over-year. The 31.4% EBITDA margin is down about 50 basis points from a year ago, primarily the result of the higher acquisition and retention costs in Wireless. Again, our expectation is for solid margin performance throughout the year, with some fluctuation quarters featuring highly successful new device launches.", "In terms of earnings, we reported $0.51 for the quarter without any non-operational or special items to point out. This compares with $0.48 in the first quarter a year ago, after adjustments for the impact of divested operations and non-operational charges in that period.  With our 4G deployment well underway, our capitalized interest will be significantly lower this year. As a result, Wireless interest expense will reflect about $150 million for each quarter this year. In terms of income taxes, the effective income tax rate attributable to Verizon for the first quarter was 30%. For the full year 2011, we are anticipating an effective tax rate to be in a range consistent with the past three quarters, post the Frontier and Alltel divestitures. Both of these items were fully contemplated in the overall earnings guidance we provided in January. With first quarter growth of 6.3%, we are on track to meet our stated objective of 5% to 8% growth off an adjusted 2010 base of $2.08 per share.", "Let's turn to cash flow and capital spending on the next slide. In addition to the higher capital spending this quarter, cash flows from operations were impacted by higher acquisition and retention costs in Wireless due to the iPhone in the first quarter funding of our full-year pension obligation, which was $392 million. In addition, the first half of last year included cash flows from the divested properties. In terms of free cash flow, we generated $672 million in the first quarter. And although this is lower than our recent trend, our cash flow outlook for the year remains very strong. Many of the cash flows were timing, and this quarter did not impact our cash management planning for the year. I would also say that there is no change in our thinking with regard to the timing of a Verizon Wireless dividend to its parent companies, which we believe will begin in 2012. ", "In the first quarter, total CapEx was $4.4 billion, of which $2.7 billion was Wireless. While we expect overall capital spending in 2011 to be essentially flat compared to 2010, we have started the year more aggressively in Wireless, spending a bit more early in the year on 4G LTE, consistent with our overall deployment plans, and continuing to add growth capacity to our 3G network. Looking forward, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE footprint, and invest in necessary capital in 3G to stay ahead of the data demand curve. Wireline capital of $1.5 billion was down 6.4% year-over-year. I would point out that we started last year in a very conservative manner, prudently spending only $3.4 billion in the first quarter, given the higher level of economic uncertainty at that time. In 2011, we will be very disciplined in the terms of overall capital spending, matching our spending with growth opportunities. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we ended the quarter with net debt of $47.2 billion, and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of about 1.4x.", "On Slide 6, we've displayed first quarter revenues for each of the last three years, which is a good illustration of the transformation and growth of our revenue base. At our investor meeting in January, we talked about this changing revenue mix, and how we've organized ourselves around the growth markets of the future based on a foundation of superior, high-IQ networks that provide the platforms for innovation that we think are unmatched in our industry. Today, 77% of our revenues are in higher growth areas, a sharp increase over the course of the last two years. As we look forward, we are big believers that our high-IQ networks give us a strong, strategic position, and put us at the center of the trends that are driving growth in our industry.", "In all these strategic areas with our continued emphasis on advancing the deployment of our 4G LTE network in Wireless, with our all-fiber network in mass markets and through our ever-improving global and cloud computing capabilities for Enterprise customers, we are well-positioned to drive higher top line growth.", "Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. As I said earlier, our Wireless business had a very impressive quarter, with growth in retail customers and ARPU driving service revenue growth and profitability. Total revenue grew to $16.9 billion in the quarter, up 10.2% year-over-year, with total service revenue up 6.3%, with the majority of our device sales occurring in the back half of the first quarter. We are expecting to see higher service revenue growth in the second quarter.", "In terms of retail postpaid ARPU growth, while we reported year-over-year growth of 2.2% in the first quarter, the month of March was 2.8% higher than last year, which is a good indication of increased revenue and ARPU growth in the second quarter.  In terms of new connections, we added a total of 1.8 million this quarter, with 906,000 net retail postpaid customers, and 897,000 wholesale and other connections, including machine-to-machine. While our focus continues to be very much on the retail postpaid market, which continues to be the vast majority of our customer base, we are also broadening our portfolio of machine-to-machine connections in a number of areas: vehicle tracking, meter reading and alarm monitoring, to name a few. And we expect this to be an area of growth for us.", "We generated $6.3 billion of EBITDA in the first quarter, up 1.7% year-over-year. And while growth in this quarter was impacted by acquisition and retention cost, our service EBITDA margin of 43.7% remains industry leading. We believe that our Wireless EBITDA margins, while they may fluctuate in a given quarter related to successful device introductions, will end up in the mid-40% range for the year. The incremental recurring revenue from smartphone and 4G device sales will help to mitigate the higher acquisition and retention costs. In addition, as I noted in January, we have also identified more than $1 billion in cost saving opportunities in Wireless this year. I am confident that our Wireless team will meet this challenge, and achieve these savings.", "Let's take a closer look at data growth and device sales on Slide 8. Total data revenue grew $1 billion or 22.3% year-over-year, and now represents 38% of total service revenue. A key driver of data growth in 2011 will be the increased penetration of smartphones in our retail postpaid phone base. To that end, we made good progress, ending the quarter with penetration of 32%.", "Roughly 60% of all phones sold in the quarter were smartphones, up from 36% just one year ago. 65% of all smartphone sales were new to the category, meaning they were existing customers with feature phones or new Verizon customers. With regard to the iPhone, specifically, 48% of upgrades were new to the smartphone category, meaning, the $30 monthly data plan is incremental revenue. About 22% of our iPhone activations represent new Verizon customers. In terms of 4G LTE, we've seen strong demand for the HTC ThunderBolt and for the PC Cards. On March 29, we introduced our first 4G mobile hotspot device and this past Monday, we announced the availability of our second one. We think these 4G mobile hotspots will be very popular with customers, as they essentially allow any WiFi-enabled device to function as a 4G LTE networked device.", "We expect demand for our 4G LTE products to strengthen as more smartphones, tablets and hotspots are added to our device portfolio. This includes the recent launch of the Novatel and Samsung mobile hotspots, as well as the addition of new 4G LTE smartphones in April, May and beyond. Clearly, our LTE network performance, our continued build-out, and the successful early product launches are having a very positive impact on the development and strength of the entire LTE ecosystem.  As customer acceptance and enthusiasm for smartphones, tablets and all kinds of connected devices gains momentum and becomes more integral to the people's personal and work life, innovation will drive this entire category and expand the overall market.", "With regard to the further expansion of our LTE footprint, we announced 38 markets in our initial launch in December, covering about 110 million PoPs [Point-of-Presence]. Since then, we've announced more than 100 additional markets in places like Detroit, Memphis, Milwaukee, Louisville, Minneapolis, Sacramento and Honolulu, to name just a few. By the end of the year, we plan to be in about 175 markets, covering more than 185 million PoPs. ", "Let's take a closer look at ARPU next on Slide 9. Throughout last year, we saw accelerating postpaid ARPU growth, starting with 0.6% year-over-year growth in the first quarter, and steadily ramping to 2.5% growth in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2011, retail postpaid ARPU growth was 2.2%. We attribute this to a few factors, but most notably to late sales in the early part of the quarter in anticipation of the iPhone 4 debut on our network in February. As I said earlier, with much stronger device sales from that point forward, our exit rate for ARPU growth heading into the second quarter was much higher at 2.8%. Data revenue continues to be sourced primarily from web and email services, which increased to $3.2 billion this quarter, up more than 38% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 1/3 of data revenue, is still showing growth, up 7% on a year-over-year basis. ", "At the end of the quarter, we had a total of 6.1 million Internet devices in our postpaid base, with 364,000 net adds in the first quarter, driven by MiFi devices and 4G PC Cards. As we would expect, our churn metrics for this quarter were excellent. Our retail postpaid churn was 1.01%, improving by four basis points year-over-year. We are encouraged by the strong demand exiting the quarter, and the positive implications for increased revenue and ARPU. You can expect us to effectively deliver both growth and profitability, with a focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market, increasing the penetration of smartphones, and selling more Internet devices, which will drive continued data revenue growth. ", "Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 10. As I said earlier, we are seeing an improvement in revenue trends. The 2.2% year-over-year decline in the first quarter is 60 basis points better than the 2.8% decline last quarter. And if we exclude the effects of the international wholesale pricing change, total Wireline revenues were down 0.7% year-over-year. On the consumer side, our FiOS broadband and video products continue to drive a significant shift in our revenue mix. FiOS now accounts for 54% of consumer revenue, up from 45% a year ago. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 23.7% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU is more than $146. On the Global Enterprise side, we had positive year-over-year growth, driven by strong strategic services growth of 12.8%. As with FiOS in the consumer market, strategic services are transforming our revenue mix, now representing 46% of total Enterprise. Within this category, advanced services like Managed Network Solutions, Contact Center Solutions, IP Communications and our cloud offerings, are growing very nicely. ", "From a profitability perspective, segment EBITDA increased $211 million or 9.7%, resulting in a 250 basis point year-over-year improvement in our EBITDA margin to 23.6%. The main reason behind the improvement was our workforce reduction initiatives in 2010, which helped reduce our overall cost of labor.  Sequentially, we had a fourth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margin improvement, with an increase of 10 basis points to 23.6%. We achieved this through a combination of revenue stabilization and effective cost management. As the typical first quarter, our cost pressures were offset by the effect of the workforce reductions. Our goal is to achieve margin expansions in 2011 through continuous improvement throughout the year. And while it is unlikely that our workforce reductions in 2011 will come close to what we experienced last year, our focus on reducing our cost structure will be vigilant.", "Let's take a closer look at the mass markets on Slide 11. Within the mass markets category, consumer revenue of $3.4 billion grew 1.9% versus last year. Consumer ARPU grew to $90.55, an increase of 10.5% from a year ago. The continued penetration of our broadband and video products have increased the scale of our FiOS platform, and is now significant enough to more than offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business.  We had another solid quarter of customer growth in FiOS TV, adding 192,000 subscribers for a total of 3.7 million TV customers. Our FiOS TV penetration at the end of the quarter was 29%.", "On the broadband side, we added 207,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the quarter. Our FiOS Internet customer base increased to 4.3 million, representing 33% penetration of homes open for sale. By adding in our 4.2 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.5 million broadband connections. This reflects an overall increase of 98,000 broadband connections, which marks our best sequential growth since the second quarter of 2009.  As I have noted in the past, our customer satisfaction ratings are very high, and our churn rates are very low. Our renewed focus on driving penetration in existing markets has been effective, and we're pleased with the overall progress in FiOS. We were off to a good start this year, and our pipeline for TV services are 43% year-over-year. ", "Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 12.  While we are seeing some signs of improvement, revenues in the business market continue to be challenged by economic pressures. Global Enterprise revenue was up 1% year-over-year. Strategic Services drove the year-over-year improvement, led by a very strong growth in Advanced Services, such as Managed Network, Call Center, IP Communications, and our cloud offerings. As I've said, this category of services is becoming a larger part of our revenues, and we are incenting our sales force to sell these solutions to our Enterprise customers. ", "As we experienced last quarter, the absolute dollar growth in Strategic Services outpaced the dollar decline in core Enterprise Services. In Global Wholesale, revenues declined 11.2% year-over-year. As we've discussed, our route rationalization strategy has resulted in a substantial decline in International Voice revenue, worth $162 million this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Since these price changes were initiated in mid-2010, I'd say we have a few more quarters to work through before the comparative impact of these actions moderates. Absent these effects, first quarter Global Wholesale revenues declined 5% year-over-year. This decline is primarily in Domestic Voice, where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower usage volumes.", "I will wrap up here with the chart we used at our investor meeting in January, showing the keys to success in terms of executing our business model. We had a solid first quarter and a quality start to the year. Our early performance gives us great confidence that we are on track to meet our financial objectives, and continue to position ourselves for future growth and profitability. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve built great momentum, and have entered the second quarter in very good shape. We're seeing continued demand for our Apple products and 4G LTE devices with more smartphones, tablets, and Internet devices coming to market shortly. As such, we expect Service revenue growth, and ARPU accretion to accelerate with each quarter this year. Our FiOS customer pipeline is very healthy, and we are very excited to add Terremark, one of the premier assets in hosting and cloud services to our portfolio of global assets and capabilities, enhancing our competitive position around the cloud opportunity, and contributing to our growth.  I'll stop here and turn it back to John, so we can open up the call to your questions.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. First, on postpaid ARPU. Fran, you gave some helpful commentary on the exit rates at 2.8% in March. I guess what that implies, though, is that the entry rates in January were probably roughly 1.5% growth, which is a step down from the fourth quarter rates, and it seemed to imply to me that the 4G laptop cards you launched in December, I guess it\u2019s logical that you would've over indexed sales here early in the quarter, which generally carry a little bit lower ARPU, and I'm wondering if you can offer granularity. Is that what happened? Just trying to put a finer point on sort of this progress through the quarter you had on ARPU. And the second question on Wireless margins. You talked about lumpiness in margins attached to handset launches, obviously, two big launches in the quarter with iPhone and ThunderBolt, but it was only a partial quarter for both. So does that mean that in 2Q, you'd expect a bit of incremental margin dilution, as we get a full quarter of those devices? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Thank you, Jason. Okay, so let's address the ARPU first. So if you look at what we did, we came out of December at 2.5%, as I said in the previous comment. We had a very soft January. We continued to maintain our upgrades. If you recall, when we launched the iPhone initially, we had a week of just upgrades to our current base, which we felt was important to show our loyalty to our customers, who stayed with us, even though we didn't have the iPhone. And then we launched the iPhone, and we had people who were waiting for that device. So again, the first half of the quarter was soft. There was really no incremental ARPU, if you will, in that first half, given that sales were low and upgrades continued. But as we launched the iPhone, and if you think about it, it was only a half a quarter, but it's also important to realize that when we launched the iPhone, initially, we only launched it through our direct channel, and a couple major retailers. And then in the beginning of March, we launched it to the rest of our national retailers, and some of our regional retailers, and we really weren't 100% out there with the distribution until mid-March. The second piece is, is that we only had two weeks of sales worth on the LTE device on smartphones. And then finally, we just launched the 4G device at the last day of the month. So I think if you look at all of this and you look at the pro rata of access on these devices, that's why we only generated 2.2% of growth, but we accelerated to 2.8%. And as we said, we think that this will just continue to accelerate as the year goes on, as we launch these initial devices. Now getting into your margin comment, no, I don't think that you'll see a decline in the second quarter. The fluctuation, I believe, will come when a new device from Apple is launched, whenever that may be, and that we will be, on the first time, in equal footing with our competitors on a new phone hitting the market, which will also be a global device. So I think there will be some fluctuations when that happens, but we don't anticipate any fluctuation in the second quarter.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "That's helpful. Thanks, Fran.", "Francis Shammo", "Thank you, Jason.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Brad.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay, Thanks, guys. Quick question on the Wireless, is 50% smartphone penetration still the target? Because I think it implies some accelerating penetration gains, which would also support your view on the improvements in ARPU. And then secondly on the Wireline side, you showed some progress there, and I guess you'll show some more progress when you lap the changes in the wholesale pricing. Is it possible that we see some Wireline growth by the end of the year in Wireline?", "Francis Shammo", "Thanks, John. So first off, on the 50% penetration, yes, we still are very confident in the 50%. And let me just be clear here because at the end of December, we labeled that we were at 26% penetration, but we changed the way we were calculating our penetration. So I want to make sure everybody's clear. We were kind of -- we were doing a different calculation than the rest of the industry, so we changed to equal the rest of the industry, so that we had an apples-to-apples comparison. So if you look at the 26% we disclosed in December, it really was 28%. Now we ended this quarter at 32%. This, I believe, is going to accelerate as we continue to launch, and have a full month of Apple on the decks. Also, with the LTE launches, as you know, we only had two weeks of our first HTC handset. We are coming out with our Samsung handset very shortly here, and then LG will be following. So we will have up to three devices launched by the second quarter. So again, that's going to accelerate the growth. And yes, we are very confident that we'll hit the 50% penetration. And then on the Wireline side of the house, I think as we continue here, we are confident that we can continue to expand the EBITDA margin in Wireline. Obviously, there is a lot of cost reduction that has to take place. We continue to work out and look at the entire logistics ecosystem. We are continuing to reduce real estate. Last year, we reduced over $7 million, and our target is equal for this year. We have a whole garage study being taking place, and we are closing garages and consolidating on that. So as you look at that continued margin, I think that's one piece of it. But as you mentioned, as we work ourselves out of the International Voice decline year-over-year, and I think that will happen entering into the third quarter. If the economy starts to stimulate a bit, and we continue to obviously penetrate on the FiOS side, I think there is a good point where we could actually see some top line growth out of the Wireline segment.", "John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. Thanks, Fran.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much. You talked about closing the Terremark transaction, Fran. Are you able to give us any color on sort of headline trends for Q1 for Terremark? And then I think in the past, in March, you talked about unlimited pricing, reviewing that on your new devices in the summer timeframe. Perhaps, you could give us an update on that? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Thank you, Simon. So on Terremark, we closed the transaction on April 11. We'll have our first full quarter here in the second quarter. Terremark continued to grow at their steady pace of 20% through the first quarter. We believe that, that will continue into the second quarter and obviously, Bob Toohey and his team on the business side, have a lot of integration activity going on with Manny and his team, and we're going to hit the streets strong with an offer here, a collaborative offer between the former Verizon business and the Terremark assets. So I think we're off to a good start there. On the unlimited pricing, we are going to be going to a tier pricing in midsummer this year. That is a definite, and you will hear more of that as we get there. But yes, we will be going to a tiered pricing for both 3G and 4G devices.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Simon.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "Thanks. One question and just a couple of housekeeping things. On the question, can you talk a little bit more about the business markets, particularly, what you're seeing in the small and medium end of the market? And are you seeing any more competition in cable there? And then from a housekeeping perspective, can you just give us the Wireless replacement rates, device replacement rates during the quarter for postpaid, and where the Wireless business ended on a net debt basis for the quarter? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. So on the -- first off, on the SMB, I think what we'll see is, first, if you look at on the Wireline side of the house and the overlap that we have there, obviously, we are at a disadvantage when you think about the DSL and the Voice strategy that we have on the former copper plant. We're at a disadvantage to cable in that area. But if you look at our FiOS and where we have passed the PRAM [Parallel Random Access Machine] and actually connected to PRAM in small business, our growth rate there is 37% year-over-year. So there is a difference between what market on the overlap of the Wireline assets we're talking about. So I think that's important to note. But from an overall perspective, I think we're flat. We've made some improvement year-over-year, but I will tell you, I'm not happy with the progress in the small-business arena, and Bobbie Mudge and his team are attacking that. But even within the Bob Toohey organization and Verizon business outside of the Wireline footprint, with the Terremark acquisition, I think we have some unique offers that we can now make to the small business arena around cloud, and I think that will help some of the offset of the former MCI mass markets, which continues to decline. From a housekeeping perspective, on net debt from an overall perspective on net debt, we ended the quarter, as I said, at $47.2 billion, and Wireless ended at about around $12 billion.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "Great. Thanks. And then just the Wireless device replacement rate for postpaid, if you have that for the quarter, that would be great too.", "Francis Shammo", "Now Michael, just to clarify, when you say replacements rate, you mean upgrades?", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "Yes.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay. So just a couple things around that. The other one point I want to make on the debt side of the house is that we have about, as I said, we have a $4 billion dollars maturity coming up here in May that will come out of Wireless. So there's a maturity of about $4 billion. So that will take the net debt down on the Wireless side as well. Then on the upgrade side of the house, as we said, that 60% of our sales were smartphones altogether. And as I said before, in January, I thought there was a major opportunity for us because our featured base as part of our postpaid base was significantly higher, and this was an area where we thought that we could make some good inroads into upgrading our feature phone base into a smartphone. This quarter, 56% of our upgrades in total, and as you see from our release, we did about 3% a quarter so -- 3% a month, so it was about 9% for the quarter. So 56% of them were upgrades of feature phones or multimedia phones to our smartphones. So when you think about that, if you look at a feature phone, which has no data plan today, that's an incremental $30 of ARPU, and on our multimedia, they had a $10 feature plan, which now we get an incremental $20 of ARPU. So I think from that perspective, I do believe that we still have some very good inroads here from our feature phone perspective going forward. We still have 62% of our base that are still on feature phones. And then on the 4G side of the house, if you look at the adds that we did, 35% of them were new to category. And when I say that, they were also feature phones who upgraded into that. Now that's part of the 56% that I talked before. But just specifically, on the 4G device, 35% of them were upgrades.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG", "Thanks for taking the question, and I really appreciate all the color around the iPhone, the ThunderBolt. So I'm just going to ask for a bit more. If we just assume that you had a very strong launch around the iPhone, particularly to the existing customers, it kind of looks like as you exited the quarter, both devices might have been selling at about the same pace, so I'm wondering if that's a reasonable conclusion here. And then you had mentioned how the iPhone didn't launch with full distribution, but that's expanded. Is that the same approach you're taking with your LTE devices, or are you actually putting them in all of your channels on day one?", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, so Brett, let me address a couple of that. So on the iPhone launch, we were cautious because we were not sure, obviously, of the demand that was there for the phone, and we wanted to monitor the supply and the demand so that we did not run into a backlog situation. From an HTC perspective, we are launching that across the board. So it is not a similar effect there. Now if you look at the iPhone, 78% of the iPhone were upgrades, and 22% of those iPhones were new to our base. So if you do the math there, you can look at -- the iPhone dropped right down into our net adds for the quarter. And then if you look at 4G and you add that in, 54% of our net adds were consistent with both the iPhone launch and the HTC launch. So 54% of our net adds came from those two devices alone. So I think that from a pace perspective, we are very, very pleased with the HTC handset launch. You have seen, probably, some of the articles I have seen, where people have tested it. This is a true 4G device. You can put as much lipstick on 3 to make it a 4, but this is truly a 4G device, with the speeds of 4G, and I think people are impressed, and people will make their decisions. So out of the gate, we're very happy with the volume, and I think that this will just continue as we continue to launch more 4G smartphone devices coming here in the next few weeks.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG", "So just one quick follow-up here, I mean, you're now selling the most popular 3G smartphone on the market in the iPhone. You're selling the most popular 4G smartphone on the market. I know it's early days, but are you seeing anything meaningfully different in the way people are using the devices?", "Francis Shammo", "Not really. I think that with the 4G speeds, obviously, people are consuming more data. That will be expected, given the video speeds and some of the TV download speeds. But keep in mind, though, that the 4G network is so much more efficient than the 3G network, so even with that incremental usage on 4G, that even at the same price of 3G, the profitability is higher. So it behooves us to move as many people to 4G as we possibly can, and you will see us doing that proactively in certain markets. So from a different standpoint, yes, they're consuming more on 4G than they are in 3G, but we expected that.", "John Doherty", "All right. Thanks, Brett.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Phil Cusick of JPMC.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Thank you for taking my call. So first, I want to see if you can give a little more detail on some of these things. You talked about the smartphone mix picking up from 60%. Can you give us what the March smartphone mix might've been as you saw that ARPU acceleration?", "Francis Shammo", "Phil, I don't have that detail. I just had it for the quarter.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then just following up on Brett's as well, the 4G data usage, you said, is higher. Can you give us an idea of what that is? Are you disclosing [ph] at this time?", "Francis Shammo", "At this point, we're not going to disclose the usage on 4G. It's really way too early to deal with that because as you know, as people get a initial handset, they initially download a lot of applications, so usage tends to be higher than the normal average. And we've only been at this HTC handset for 2 weeks, so I think it's premature to release anything like that.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. I'll try one more swing, and then maybe I'll be out. So you talked about the iPhone being a global device. When that launches, do you anticipate that being a 4G device and sort of being at par in terms of speeds with your other 4G?", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, I can't answer for Apple's product launch, to be honest with you. All I know is it will be a global device. At that point, I think we'll have to go to Apple to find out exactly what that device will have.", "John Doherty", "Nice try, Phil.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "All right. I tried. Thanks a lot, Fran.", "Francis Shammo", "All right. Thanks, Phil.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities. ", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Barden, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Mike McCormack, Nomura Securities.", "Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Yes, just a couple of quick questions. First, not to beat the ARPU thing to death here, but you guys have identified, obviously, some back-end loading of the smartphones, and that's -- I think that's good color. But thinking about ARPU growth, can you sort of identify the offsets, which might be coming in the form of voice pressure from family share roaming. And then how should we think about data devices like tablets and sticks and cards and stuff like that, that may carry a lower overall ARPU, which could sort of have an impact on the growth rate, but obviously, driving some decent adds. And then secondly, and it might be premature, but thinking about the iPhone guidance for the year based on 11 million, the 2.2 million tracking a bit lower, not surprising given a partial quarter, but it's also the launch quarter. So just trying to figure out what's your thought processes there? You, obviously, were anticipating a refresh at some point during the year that obviously could boost that as well, but just some thoughts around that would be great.", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, sure. Thanks, Mike. So from an ARPU's perspective, from a Voice ARPU perspective, we are, obviously, seeing a decline there, but it is a slowing decline year-over-year. So yes, that is putting pressure on us, but it is putting a pressure on us at a slower rate, and we view that as that will continue into the future. Also, from a Voice ARPU perspective, as we launch the iPhone, I guess I would be remiss to say that the call quality on the iPhone has been spectacular on the 3G CDMA network. And obviously, we think that our Voice will continue to slow as we add more iPhones, and people realize the quality of the voice network and the data network there. So I think that'll be fine. From a tablet and a broadband access device perspective, there is some small dilution going on from the old price plans to the new price plans, but we don't see that as being a drag to the overall ARPU, as we continue to penetrate into the tablet scenario, into the 4G MiFi devices, and the usage that the MiFi devices will bring, and the tiered pricing that we already have related to our data products. So I don't see that as being a major issue going forward. And as far as the 2.2 million in the first quarter and the 11 million, overall, we're sticking with our 11 million view for our guidance purposes.", "Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Great. Thanks, Fran. I appreciate it.", "Francis Shammo", "Thank you, Mike.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "David Barden", "Thanks, guys, for taking the question. Just two, if I could, maybe, Fran, just starting with the debt raise recently this past quarter, and kind of bulking up on the balance sheet, both kind of $9 billion-or-so, with $7 billion going into cash. Obviously, we've got the Terremark deal cash going out the door, but is this cash that we put on the balance sheet really about trying to avoid the necessity of upstreaming dividends or maintaining leverage at the Verizon Wireless business? Because I did notice that you guys kind of called out that specifically in the call today, that you didn't want to have to do anything on the dividend until next year. But because you're not, you had to go into the markets and raise this money and put cash on the balance sheet. I'm just wondering if you could kind of talk for your thinking there. And I think the second question, if I could, is just maybe more strategically, thinking about the industry consolidation. I think you guys have come out as fairly neutral on AT&T's prospective acquisition of T-Mobile. With the caveat, as long as it doesn't lead towards incremental regulation of the industry, could you talk a little bit about what kinds of regulations you think would be the kinds of regulations that would get you up off the bench to kind of come in and oppose this deal? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay. Thank you, David. So first, on the debt side of the house, yes, we actually went out into the market, because we have some debt maturities, both within corporate and Wireline this year, that needed to be refinanced, and we initially did it. The interest rates were so well, we took advantage of the interest rates, and raised it to $6.25 billion. We have about $2 billion worth of maturities coming in the back half of the year. We had a $500 million refinancing that took place in the first quarter. We also wanted to re [indiscernible] finance some of our CP paper, commercial paper, so we did that as well. And due to the lucrativeness of the interest rates we had, we also decided to pre-fund our pension plan of $400 million, both to take effect of the interest rate and the arbitrage on that, compared to the return that, that $400 million we'd get in the pension plan, that would help us alleviate some of our future cash flow obligations into the plan. So this really was all-around just the refinancing and rebalancing of our balance sheet, and just for general other observations. And as you said, to pay for the Terremark, and also to refinance the Terremark debt. And then from an AT&T and a T-Mobile merger perspective, I guess the comment I would have is we have to let that go through due process with the federal government. And we'll sit and wait and see. Obviously, we will then take a view of -- if it's a market-based condition merger, we will be fine with that. If it's a regulatory merger, then we'll have a harder time with it. Now as far as what may have been a little bit off here is, I'm not going to go into what types of things we may object to but obviously, we are very strong on where we stand with net neutrality. We are very strong where we stand with data roaming, and the positions that the FCC have recently taken there, and we will not stand by if there are certain regulations put on us that we have to deliver certain things at a fixed price that's set by a regulatory arm that has no authority over that regulation of price. So we'll sit back, let it go through its due process, and then we'll see what happens.", "David Barden", "All right, guys. Thanks.", "John Doherty", "Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Thanks, guys. Two broader questions. Fran, on the Managed Services front, I know it's early in the process here, but do you find yourself bumping up against more some of the traditional IT outsourcers in that market? And do you have the capabilities you need in managed services to at this point, or do you need more acquisitions? And then secondly, on the smartphone side, could you talk about, ultimately, what you'd like to see in terms of number of suppliers on the different platforms and maybe, market share platform? And related to this, the subsidies for handsets, do you think we're at peak run rates here, and they can start to decline, or do you think we'll see handset subsidies on the smartphones increase for awhile? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay. Thanks, Tim. So on the Managed Services side, I think that we have the portfolio of assets that we need to be very successful in this piece of the business, and I think we've shown that with some of the wins that we have publicly stated here in the past. And you're absolutely right, we are actually entering into a market where we're competing with many different players, depending upon where you are in the globe. Especially here in the U.S., we go up against all of the integrators, and some of the other service providers. But outside the globe, we hit on a bunch of different players like Tata and InfoSystems, and people like that. So it depends where you are in the globe, but we think we\u2019re very well-positioned with our portfolio. And we've shown this with our strategic services growth of 12.8%. Some of the growth this quarter and the reason it jumped up was driven by our Managed Services business. So I think we're starting to really gain new ground here. We have proven ourselves with some of the major undertakings that we've taken with some of our announced deals with Matsui and JetBlue, and others. So I think we've got a good stance, and I don't think we need to do any more major acquisitions in this portfolio. As far as the smartphone side of the house and subsidies, I think, first, we're charging a premium on the 4G smartphone, so the subsidy, obviously, there is less than others, but we'll have to see how the market goes. And I would assume that this market will mature this similar that the feature phone market matured over the years, where as more players become into the marketplace, and we have new entrants, like maybe a Huawei, down the road, there will be put pressure on the other manufacturers to get more efficient and reduce price, and then that will help our subsidy go. So I think the maturity of the market and the ecosystem will eventually take care of itself.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Tim.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse.", "Jonathan Chaplin - JPMorgan", "Thanks for taking the question. So one question, AT&T gave us one or two of the justifications for the deal, getting access to a lot more spectrum, and increasing their cell site density quickly. I think up to this transaction, they're going to have significant -- 50 megahertz or so more spectrum than you, and a cell site density, which is 25% to 35% more dense than yours as well. Can you talk about how you see your spectrum needs evolving over the course of the next three-to-five years? And what do you think you need to do from a cell site density perspective to keep up with the rapidly growing data demand you're seeing? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So as we\u2019ve said before, we think we're in a very good spectrum position. We think we have the spectrum we need, and we're in a good position until about the year 2015 at this point. And we will continue to keep our eyes open to see where we need to buy spectrum or secure spectrum. But right now, we're in a very, very good position. I'm not going to speak to the competitor. You can ask those questions as to why they did this, and why they needed the spectrum, but I think we're in a very good position.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Fran. Thanks to all of the participants that joined us this morning.

Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning are Fran Shammo, Verizon's Chief Financial Officer; and Lowell McAdam; Verizon's newly-elected President and Chief Executive Officer effective August 1. ", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "Before we get started, I'd like to point out that our second quarter includes the results of Terremark since the acquisition closed in early April. As we go through the presentation, we will point out the effects on certain growth rates as appropriate. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis Shammo", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief overview commentary adding my perspective to our second quarter results. We had a very strong quarter, continuing the positive momentum from earlier this year. Our results clearly demonstrate that we are executing well in our key areas of focus and driving profitable growth. ", "Our top line revenue growth accelerated to 6.3% year-over-year, which is a 100 basis point increase from our first quarter growth rate of 5.3%. This was our strongest quarter of consolidated revenue growth in 2.5 years. ", "In Wireless, we had an outstanding quarter of customer growth, with strong demand for smartphones and Internet data devices and increasing service revenue, driving total revenue growth of 10.2%. We also saw continued improvement in Wireline revenue, with higher Global Enterprise revenue driven primarily by improvements in Strategic Services. ", "EBITDA margins this quarter expanded sequentially in both Wireless and Wireline, as we continue to focus on driving top line growth as well as improving our operating efficiency. In Wireless, our EBITDA service margin expanded 170 basis points from first quarter to 45.4%, an impressive result in light of increased postpaid customer growth, continued smartphone penetration and Internet device expansion.", "In Wireline, the EBITDA margin increased by 20 basis points to 23.8%, our fifth consecutive quarter of margin improvement, through a combination of better revenue performance and our continued focus on cost containment. Our second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share is a very solid result, up from $0.51 in the first quarter and demonstrates good execution and the strength of our business model and the strategy that we discussed with you back in January. ", "With that, let's begin a more detailed review of the quarter on Slide 4 starting with consolidated results. As I just highlighted, we have strong top line growth in the second quarter, with consolidated revenue increasing to $27.5 billion, up $1.6 billion or 6.3% year-over-year. By capitalizing on the growth opportunities in Wireless, FiOS and enterprise Strategic Services, together with improving our wholesale business, our consolidated revenue trends continue to be very positive. Our consolidated EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $9 billion, up 5.2% year-over-year. On a sequential basis, our consolidated EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points to 32.7%. ", "In terms of earnings, again, as I highlighted in the overview, we had a very strong quarter, reporting $0.57 of EPS without any nonoperational or special items. This compares favorably with $0.51 last quarter and $0.51 in the second quarter of 2010, after making the necessary adjustments for the impact of divested operations and nonoperational charges in that period. So a solid performance as far as driving growth to the bottom line, representing an 11.8% increase in EPS on both a sequential and year-over-year basis.", "Year-to-date earnings totaled $1.07 per share, up 8.1% over the same time last year. Again, our overall first half performance confirms the strength of the business and the path that we are on to create long-term shareholder value.", "Let's turn to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our cash flow results for the quarter showed a significant sequential improvement, driven by higher revenue growth, margin expansion and favorable changes in working capital, some of which were timing-related, as I indicated last quarter. In terms of capital expenditures, while we've had a higher level of spending in the first half compared with last year, our additional investments are in support of increased customer volumes and higher revenue growth in Wireless. ", "First half CapEx this year totaled $8.9 billion, of which $5.4 billion was Wireless. As we discussed before, we started this year more aggressively in Wireless. To date, our network spending of 3G is well ahead of our capacity requirements for the full year, and we have also spent a bit more on 4G LTE consistent with our deployment plans. Based on our current forecast, I expect Wireless capital expenditures to decrease in the second half of 2011. ", "In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $3.1 billion for the first half, which is down 5.9% year-over-year. On a consolidated basis, capital spending in the second half will be lower than the first half. For the full year, we are targeting capital expenditures to be similar to 2010 at about $16.5 billion.", "In terms of free cash flow, we've generated $3.9 billion for the first 6 months, and although this is lower than recent trends, our cash flow outlook for the balance of the year remains very strong especially in light of the lower capital requirements. ", "From a balance sheet perspective, our financial position remains strong. Net debt at the end of June was $47.7 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio remained at about 1.4x. We also closed the Terremark acquisition and refinanced about $800 million of their debt at more favorable rates. ", "On Slide 6, we displayed second quarter revenues for each of the last 3 years, which is a good illustration of the transformation and growth of our revenue base. As we've pointed out in prior quarters, about 77% of our revenues are in strategic areas of higher growth, up from about 70% 2 years ago. With our continued emphasis on advancing the deployment of our 4G LTE network in Wireless, with our all fiber network in mass markets and through our global reach and cloud computing capabilities for enterprise customers, we continue to be well positioned to drive higher top line growth as the strategic transformation of Verizon continues.", "Let's now move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless business had a very impressive quarter, with accelerated growth in postpaid connections, higher service revenue growth, continued strong postpaid phone ARPU growth, improvement in customer churn and greater profitability and free cash flow. ", "Total revenue grew to $17.3 billion in the quarter, up 10.2% year-over-year, with a 6.6% increase in total service revenue. This year-over-year growth in total service revenue is 30 basis points higher than the 6.3% we reported in the first quarter. Total quarterly data revenue grew to $5.8 billion, up $1.1 billion or 22.2% year-over-year. Data revenue now represents 39.5% of our total service revenue. ", "As you know, a key driver of data growth has been the increased penetration of smartphones. We continue to make good progress on that front, increasing penetration of our retail postpaid phone base from 32% last quarter to 36% this quarter. Just one year ago, smartphone penetration was 21%.", "Within the postpaid category, we are also seeing very strong demand for our Internet data devices, particularly 4G, mobile hotspots or MiFi devices and dongles. We are the market leader in these devices, with a large and growing number of these customer connections now representing more than 7.5% of our retail postpaid base. ", "In many cases, these data-only devices represent an additional connection as a growing number of customers have more than one device. I would also point out that while the revenues are clearly additive to our top line, these devices have a very short payback period as they typically carry a much lower subsidy than the phones within our portfolio. ", "Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We are clearly gaining market share in the retail postpaid market, driven by increasing demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. During the second quarter, we added 2.2 million total connections, of which nearly 1.3 million were retail postpaid. This was our highest quarter of postpaid additions since the fourth quarter of 2008. ", "Within the 1.3 million postpaid additions, about 60% were phones. In the retail prepaid category, we had net additions of 61,000. Of note were 241,000 prepaid tablets, which are contributing to sequential growth and prepaid ARPU. Outside of the retail category, we added about 890,000 wholesale and other connections this quarter. Only a small percentage of these net adds were the typical reseller phone devices. A majority of these additions were vehicle tracking, telematics and machine-to-machine devices. ", "While our focus will continue to remain very heavily on the retail postpaid market, which represents more than 80% of our total connections, we are also broadening our portfolio of machine-to-machine connections. And while these connections generally have lower monthly revenue profiles, they represent incremental revenue at a very high profit margin. ", "At our Verizon Innovation Center in Waltham, companies, entrepreneurs and others across the LTE ecosystem are coming together to create the next generation of products and solutions that will deliver the power and possibilities of 4G LTE. We expect this to be an increasing area of growth for us in the future, and we'll continue to expand our M2M offerings. ", "Total device sales, gross adds and upgrades were strong once again this quarter. We had postpaid gross adds of more than 3.5 million, which is an increase of more than 20% year-over-year, and about 9% of our retail postpaid customer base upgraded to a new device. About 90% of the postpaid devices sold this quarter were phones, with roughly 60% of these being 3G and 4G smartphones. Also noteworthy is the fact that half of all Internet data device sales this quarter were 4G LTE. ", "This strong demand across all product lines is not only increasing our postpaid connections and driving revenue growth but is also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.89%, our lowest in 3 years. ", "Next, let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at retail postpaid ARPU. Throughout last year, we saw accelerating retail postpaid ARPU growth, starting with 0.6% in the first quarter and steadily ramping to 2.5% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of 2011, our retail postpaid ARPU growth was 2.2%. This quarter, retail postpaid ARPU growth was 1.9%. ", "To enhance the understanding around the growth trend of this blended metric, it is important to note that there are a few different dynamics occurring within the category, which, while having an impact on the growth rate of the ARPU metric, are quite positive and strong indicators of future revenue growth. The first thing to recognize is that retail postpaid phone ARPU is higher than the blended postpaid metric of $54.12. ", "As we've illustrated on this slide, the rate of growth has increased significantly in the past year to 3.2% this quarter, driven of course by the increase in smartphone penetration. That said, within the postpaid category, the significant unit growth in Internet data devices, while adding total service revenue growth and expansion of the category, is having a dilutive effect on the total postpaid ARPU rate of growth at this point in time.", "Within the Internet data device category, we are seeing strong demand for our mobile hotspot or MiFi devices, dongles and tablets, while the unit growth is very strong and the key area of focus for us in expanding this category, the average ARPU on these devices, is less than $54 and is declining on a year-over-year basis. We are seeing some migration of 3G customers who were paying about $60 per month to a new 4G device at a $50 per month price point. These pricing plans are intended to expand the category, while delivering high profitability, and we already see evidence of this in our second quarter margin result. ", "The strategy within this category of devices is to build share so that we can benefit from the significant growth in usage we anticipate in the future. We are confident that the innovation will drive the development of bandwidth-intensive video and data applications that will appeal to consumers and provide utility for enterprise customers. ", "By gaining a strong foothold in this market, particularly when you think about the potential for tablets, we have a great opportunity to benefit from this increased video and data usage. Together with our move to tier pricing, where the next price point for 10 megabits is $80 per month, we believe that as we move into 2012 and 2013, these trends will provide ARPU accretion in this category.", "To date, the very strong demand for these devices is resulting in strong revenue growth, albeit at lower ARPU than with phones. The other positive element to the sale of 4G LTE devices is the migration of data traffic from our 3G to our 4G network, which is highly desirable from a capital efficiency and profitability perspective and will help us drive improved returns into the future. ", "Stepping back from the postpaid ARPU metric, it is important to note that total data revenue continues to be sourced primarily from Web and e-mail services, which increased to $3.4 billion this quarter, up more than 35% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up about 1/3 of data revenue, is still showing growth, albeit at a slower pace at nearly 6% on a year-over-year basis.", "With regard to Apple iPhone 4, we activated 2.3 million units this quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million since we started selling the phone in early February. Sales have been steady, and in fact, is one of the top performing phones on our 3G network in terms of voice quality with the least number of dropped or lost calls and high overall customer satisfaction. ", "As far as 4G devices are concerned, we have been very pleased with the sales to date. As you know, we have 9 LTE devices in the market today: 3 smartphones, 2 mobile hotspots, 3 laptop dongles and 1 tablet for pre-order with availability very soon. During the quarter, we sold a total of 1.2 million 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. ", "In terms of an update on our LTE deployment, we are now providing service in 102 markets covering more than 160 million PoPs. We are well on track with our plan to have coverage of 185 million PoPs or better by the end of 2011.", "Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the second quarter, we generated $6.7 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 2.5% year-over-year and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 170 basis points sequentially to 45.4%. This margin is a very strong result against the backdrop of an increasing number of device sales. ", "To me, this speaks to our strategy of increasing growth and profitability and clearly demonstrates how we create long-term shareholder value. Again, the combination of top line growth and effective cost controls give me confidence in our ability to sustain our industry-leading profitability and free cash flow generation.", "We are encouraged by the strong demand for our products and the positive implications for revenue growth. Going forward, you can expect us to effectively deliver both growth and profitability with a continued strong focus on gaining share in the retail postpaid market. Within this market, we will continue to expand the Internet data device category, including tablets and further increase the penetration of smartphones to drive revenue growth and long-term profitability.", "Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. We continue to see improving revenue trends in our Wireline business. Total revenue in the second quarter was $10.2 billion, a 0.3% year-over-year decline. While the inclusion of Terremark added about 100 basis points of growth, this still marks solid improvement over the 2.2% decline in the first quarter. ", "In mass markets, our FiOS broadband and video products continue to drive a positive shift in our revenue mix. FiOS now accounts for 57% of consumer revenue, up from 48% a year ago. FiOS revenue in the quarter grew 20.7% year-over-year, and FiOS ARPU is more than $146. ", "In Global Enterprise, revenue growth improved to 3.6% year-over-year, driven by strong Strategic Services growth of 17.8%. Again, the inclusion of Terremark added $98 million to second quarter enterprise revenue. ", "As we've said, Strategic Services are becoming a much larger portion of our revenue mix, now representing 48% of total enterprise. Within this category, advanced services like Managed Network Solutions, Contact Center Solutions, IP Communications and our cloud offerings are growing very nicely. ", "From a profitability perspective, segment EBITDA increased $128 million or 5.5% year-over-year resulting in a 140 basis point improvement in our EBITDA margin to 23.8% primarily as a result of our workforce reduction initiatives in 2010. On a sequential basis, this marked the fifth consecutive quarter of EBITDA margin improvement.", "Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Within the mass markets category, consumer revenue of $3.4 billion grew 1.3% versus last year. Consumer ARPU grew to $92.44, an increase of 9.4% from a year ago. Residential access line loss this quarter was 8.2% compared with 10% a year ago. The continued penetration of our broadband and video products have increased the scale of our FiOS platform and is now significant enough to more than offset the secular and competitive pressures in this part of the business. ", "We had another solid quarter of customer growth in FiOS TV adding 184,000 subscribers for a total of 3.8 million TV customers. Our FiOS TV penetration at the end of the quarter was 30%. On the broadband side, we added 189,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the quarter. Our FiOS Internet customer base increased to 4.5 million, representing 34% penetration of homes open for sale. ", "By adding in our 4.1 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.6 million broadband connections. This reflects an overall increase of 62,000 broadband connections. Our strategy of driving penetration in existing markets has been effective, and we intend to maintain this momentum as penetration continues to improve in all of our FiOS markets.", "Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 13. Within Global Enterprise, Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement, led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP Communications and our cloud offerings. As we experienced last quarter, the absolute dollar growth in Strategic Services outpaced the dollar decline in core Enterprise Services. ", "In Global Wholesale, revenues declined 7.4% year-over-year. As we've discussed, our route rationalization strategy resulted in a substantial decline in International Voice revenue of about $111 million this quarter on a year-over-year basis. Since these price changes were initiated in mid-2010, we have 1 or 2 more quarters to work through before the comparative impact of these actions moderates. Absent these effects, second quarter Global Wholesale revenues declined 2.9% year-over-year. This decline is primarily in Domestic Voice where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower usage volumes.", "I will wrap up here with a summary slide to highlight our second half of 2011 areas of focus. We had a strong first half of the year, demonstrating solid execution of our strategy while increasing profitability. In the second half of the year, you can expect us to continue to drive strong top line growth in our key strategic areas. ", "We have great momentum in Wireless, and we expect to build on that strength. We're seeing continued demand for our existing 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices, with more smartphones, tablets and data devices in the pipeline. ", "In FiOS, we will continue to drive higher penetration in our existing markets and capture pent-up demand in new markets. In the enterprise space, we continue to enhance our position as a leading global provider in the information technology solution space. With the integration of Terremark well underway, we have improved our ability to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure, providing us with a significant opportunity in this high-growth part of the market. ", "While achieving higher top line growth is great, we must ensure that this is profitable and sustainable. Our focus is on driving growth in products and services that are not only increasing our market share, but also expanding margins and improving profitability. ", "I can assure you that the business will remain very focused on our cost structure and achieving meaningful cost reductions. The strategic actions and execution of our plans have strengthened our Wireless and Wireline businesses. ", "Our objective is to continue to drive increases in free cash flow through improved operating performance, disciplined capital spending and the efficient use of working capital. We intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and a very competitive dividend, as this is critical component of shareholder value creation.", "So I will end there, and it gives me great pleasure to now turn the call over to our newly-elected President and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam.", "Lowell McAdam", "Thank you, Fran, and good morning everyone on the call. Today is obviously an important day for Verizon as we transition the CEO role from Ivan to me. ", "This has been a very smooth transition by any measure, and we have Ivan to thank for that. He has had a very clear plan from the beginning, and that is to keep the focus on customers and our investors. ", "I want to be sure that I say to investors on my first day on the job that I understand the obligations that come with this position and that is to deliver bottom line results. Ivan has built a tremendous company over his 18 years of leadership. He has moved this business from a regional wireline voice business to the leading national wireless company and to a Global Enterprise technology company. ", "I believe we can accelerate that transformation to a global solutions and networking company. I believe that the pieces are already in place to do that, and that we are showing good momentum in our results to further fuel that transformation. ", "Morning Fran has done his usual highly professional job explaining the results. A few things stand out for me. First, Wireless continues to show strong growth and industry-leading profitability. We have been through many transitions of devices and technology. The consistency of results in the face of a highly competitive and dynamic market show the underlying strength of our team and our operations. ", "Second, the FiOS strategy has proven itself by taking share and gaining revenues. Our enterprise strategy, fueled by the MCI, the Cybertrust and now, the Terremark acquisition, is producing a highly-successful portfolio of services that are being rapidly adopted by our customers. ", "And finally, I see a cost-control mindset that is driving overall profitability. While my optimism is certainly based on performance, I also see tremendous potential ahead. First, I'm pleased with the organization structure and the management team that we've put in place last October. They're rolling up their sleeves and diving into many opportunities to reengineer our processes and policies. This will streamline our operations to deliver better service to our customers and better cost performance.", "Second, we have leading-edge technology platforms in FiOS, LTE, our IP backbone and now the cloud. These investments will pay dividends now and in the future. As we see far more demand for video, data and enterprise applications, we are better positioned than any other company to meet evolving customer needs. ", "Third, we've begun to effectively partner to drive innovation for our customers. Some of the most innovative companies in ours and adjacent industries are working in our existing innovation center in Waltham, Massachusetts and the soon-to-be opened sister center in San Francisco. We see an exciting roadmap of new consumer and business products on the horizon.", "Finally, I am pleased with the evolution of our partnership with Vodafone. We are clearly moving from a purely financial partnership to an operating partnership. We are now facing our largest multinational customers as one team. We've aligned our product and our technology roadmaps, and we are beginning to purchase infrastructure together. All of these actions will begin to enhance our revenue and our cost profiles. ", "As my last comment, I'd say we have just finished taking the top 300 leaders of Verizon through a class we call leading for shareholder value. Fran and I teach significant sections of the class, which focuses on how we can drive the business to higher returns. I am very pleased by the reaction of the senior team and their commitment to our success. We use the term, there's always a higher gear, meaning no matter where you are in the business, there are opportunities to improve. That's what makes being part of Verizon so exciting, and that's what positions us so well for the future. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to John. Thank you.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Lowell. Brad, that concludes our opening segment of the call. Let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank", "I guess the question is for Fran. I'm trying to maybe get a sense for the trends in Wireless ARPU and basically what happened between the 2.8% growth in margin and what we saw in the first quarter. It sounds like -- for the second quarter, it sounds like it's a mix -- it's a combination of increased mix of connected devices and some ARPU pressure within each category. And specifically, you mentioned that the migration from 3G to 4G putting pressure on ARPU because those are lower-priced devices. If you could give us a sense for maybe the magnitude of which one was the larger of the drivers. And two, maybe how far through that migration of customers from 3G to 4G ROE, how much more pressure do you expect from that specific issue? And maybe give us a sense for what you expect for ARPU trends going forward in the postpaid side.", "Francis Shammo", "John, so this is -- I'm glad the question came because this is one that's important. So if you look at -- we've actually disclosed the new metric that we now call phone ARPU, which consists of our smartphones and our feature phones. And again, this quarter, we saw a very good uptick from feature phone to smartphone, about 53% with the Apple phone, transforming from the feature phone into the smartphone. So we're seeing that 3.2% continuing into the future. I think the important thing here is though is on the Internet devices, and it's important to know because if you go back to October of last year when the market changed pricing on all of Internet devices, we actually launched Internet pricing at $35 per 3 gig; $50 for 5 and $80 for 10. And as we saw the market and we expanded the market in this category with also the innovation of the 4G LTE network and now all the devices that we have on that. In May, we actually pulled the $35 price point from the marketplace. So that was part of the contribution of why we saw an acceleration of the dilution in the Internet ARPU. We have now since pulled that, so now the entry point is $50 stepping up to $80. So we've made that change, and I think that in itself will start to see improvement in the third quarter. But needless to say, the amount of devices and the volume within the 4G network we're very pleased with, with moving 1.2 million devices this quarter. And as you said, John, we are seeing folks who are coming off of their contracts on 3G moving over to the 4G and stepping down from their legacy pricing of the $60 and $70 price point down to the $50 price point. But I also want to make sure that it's important to realize that these devices are a much lower subsidy, and the profitability on these devices are extremely high. So it's the right thing to do. We're expanding the category. We're seeing the expansion with our tablets, with our 4G network with tablets, where we now have our first 4G tablet coming to marketplace. It can be pre-ordered, and we think that, that will also make a dynamic change here. The other thing that I want to talk about ARPU and something that I've mentioned before is because of the dynamics of the industry and the way it's changing, we now have a number of tablets being sold as prepaid. So what you saw this quarter is -- and the sequential accretion in the prepaid ARPU because we're placing more and more tablets onto a prepaid pricing system. The other thing that's interesting to note is more than 50% of these prepaid customers are buying at $35 and higher price points even on the prepaid plan. So this strategy is working. I think we'll continue to expand this, but I do think that we'll see continued pressure in the Internet device category.", "John Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank", "So Fran, do you expect total service revenue growth to continue to accelerate from here?", "Francis Shammo", "I believe we're going to be seeing continued acceleration of service growth.", "Lowell McAdam", "John, this is Lowell. Just if I look back over my 20-some years on the Wireless side, every time we brought in new devices, we brought in new use cases, we saw nice expansion of the market. And I think that's just what you see going on here today. In some ways, it's similar to when we all went to family share plans. So there was a big concern over what ARPU was going to do. But we expanded the market nicely, great profitability, and I think that's exactly what's going on here now. And so we feel very good about the position.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "You talked about the Vodafone partnership and opportunities. Can you talk about the dividend potential, where the sort of negotiations stand and what sort of timing and type of payment we should be expecting there?", "Lowell McAdam", "Sure. So I'll let Fran talk specifically about the dividend here. But I think that Vittorio's and my goal over the last 18 months have really been to try to turn the temperature down a little bit and to improve the bottom line of the relationship. So we've really focused -- because we knew LTE was on the horizon here, we started out by focusing on aligning the technology roadmaps, and that will go all the way through purchasing network equipment together as they're a little bit behind us because they don't have the spectrum for LTE, but they're beginning that ramp now. We also have heard very clearly from the large enterprise customers that combining the assets of Verizon business, meaning the global IP backbone and their data center infrastructure, and that's -- an exclamation point went on that with the Terremark purchase, that we could provide a global fix and mobile solution. So we've now -- we have teams that -- its one team made up of Verizon and Vodafone employees that face our top 50 accounts, and we're going to be expanding that very quickly. And there's a number of other smaller, but those are the main ones. Now regarding the dividend, we've been very clear that there will be a dividend. And why don't I let Fran just talk a little bit about the mechanics.", "Francis Shammo", "I think, Simon, at this point, I've made my comments on the dividend. I don't think there's really anything else to comment on, on the dividend.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Fran, I might've missed it, but could you comment on what you're seeing in terms of LTE speeds and maybe monthly over monthly data usage? And then on the margin front, you had a great sequential growth there, about 130 basis points on a consolidated basis. Could you talk about maybe the trends over the next few quarters and where you think you can be kind of longer term at this point? You've had almost a decade of restructuring in the business and a lot obviously upgrades to the infrastructure, and you're still substantially below where the margins used to be historically.", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, Tim, on the LTE speeds, we're seeing consistent from what we had disclosed before. We don't get into disclosure of any 4G LTE device usage at this point. Again, I think it's too early to really get a good average on what those speeds will be amongst all the different devices that we have there. As far as on the consolidated margin basis, I think I'll be consistent to say that our business strategy and what we disclosed back in January, I think it proves that we have proven that the strategy is working. We're expanding the market. We're growing our top line, and I think that the margin will follow here based on what Lowell just said where our main points of concentration are, which is the top line growth in all of our different business segments and taking cost out of the business.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Maybe a couple of questions. First on capital spending. You obviously talked about flat this year. I'm just wondering from here if there are opportunities. Obviously, FiOS spending starts to wind down. Would you expect to sort of reinvest the declines in FiOS spending into either Wireless or Enterprise? Or do we continue to have sort of an outlook of flat to maybe even down capital spending as we look beyond the year? And then second, just on enterprise, maybe some of the SME trends. You have choppy macro data points from here. Did they give you any pause about the momentum you're seeing in that business as you look at the balance of the year?", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, I'll answer the first one, Jason. I'll let Lowell take the enterprise one. On the capital spending side, I think we'll just stick with 2011 at this point. And as you know, we spent $8.5 billion worth in the units. We're a total of $8.9 billion for the first half. And as I said back in January, we would be a little different this year because, historically, we've always kind of accelerated our capital expend through the year, and I was very clear at the beginning that said we would have an acceleration in the first half and then a decline because we felt that the capacity of EVDO was built out, and we still are very comfortable with that projection. So you should see that decline coming in the second half of this year. And I think at this point, we know that we still have LFA requirements on the FiOS build of about 1 million homes for the next 2 years. So I don't see any major change on premise past perspective, at least for the next 2 years out. And we said that we would commit on passing 18 million homes, and Lowell and I've said that we would stop there. And then based on penetration rates into the future, then we will make those decisions. So at this point, we'll stick with the flat for 2011, and we'll come back later and talk about the outer years.", "Lowell McAdam", "On the enterprise question, Jason, and macro trends, I would love to be able to tell you that we see significant improvement in the overall economic outlook, but we can't really say that at this point. What we see is a shift. And whereas 2 years ago, you were seeing a lot of enterprise expansion, now we're actually able to capitalize on the cost reduction plans of these enterprises. So I think that's why cloud is picking up significantly for us as well as some of our other Strategic Services because the IT department is looking for an opportunity to take advantage of our scale and our applications and so they're shifting -- we're seeing some nice shifts of business. But as far as overall, do we see the economy coming out of this flat plateau? We say, no. I can't say that we see that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "Just coming back to the Wireline side, can you help frame the margin opportunity for Wireline both over the next couple quarters and next few years especially in front of the labor negotiations. And maybe within that context you can give us an update there.", "Lowell McAdam", "Okay, why don't I just make a comment. This is Lowell, on the labor side, Mike, and then Fran can add additional thoughts. I think the tone is good with the union so far. We have lots of dialogue. I think they've been very professional. We understand and I think -- I won't speak for them, but it's clear that when you see the core Access Line decline and you see the pressures on the Wireline business, that some things do need to change. And yes, we've asked for some changes in our work rules, and we've asked for them to consider coming on to the general employee and management medical plans. Those are probably the big issues. I think we're just coming into the time where we enter into serious negotiations as we get close to the August 6 date. And I'm optimistic that we'll be able to work something through that'll be fair and equitable to both sides.", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, Mike, on the margin side, I think I've been pretty consistent, and we've delivered consecutive margin improvement for the last 5 quarters. And I'll commit again that our business strategy is to continue to improve the Wireline margin through top line growth, as well as cost containments. And as Lowell always tells me, there's plenty of pots of gold out there to go after in the Wireline business. So we will continue to take cost out and really concentrate on those strategic revenue growth opportunities within the Wireline business, consisting of FiOS, the enterprise side and especially with the acquisition of Terremark. So I think our plan is there, we just have to execute on our strategy.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc", "And can you disclose the ending net debt balance for Verizon Wireless?", "Francis Shammo", "For this quarter, it's about $6 billion.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Barden of Bank of America.", "David Barden", "Two questions, if I could, real quick. Number one, even stripping out Terremark from the Global Enterprise, it was a nice, healthy tickup in 2Q versus 1Q, but we didn't really see that in the small medium business segment. Could you talk about the different dynamics that are driving those kind of businesses in different directions right now? And the second, if I could, just quickly on kind of the iPhone and LTE sales. Could you talk about what percentage was new to the base and what percentage was upgrades?", "Francis Shammo", "Sure, Dave. So with that, on the small business side, and I'm assuming that you're -- let me just get a clarification here. You're looking at the, really the SOHO business within the Wireline segment, which was actually down by 5.2% this quarter. And I think what's happening here is that we're seeing additional line loss in that segment. Now the actual Internet and broadband connection in that segment was actually positive for us this quarter, but we did see an acceleration of line loss. And I think what I would contribute it to is if you look at the national startup of small businesses, we are down on a national basis over 50% from where we were last year on startups. So I think it's an inflection of we don't have as much coming in the door to offset that line loss. And the line loss is not increasing but it's consistent. So I think we saw a little bit of a different dynamic in that 0 to 20 SOHO business, which created that acceleration there. But it's nothing that I'm overly concerned about. It's not a big portion of our portfolio. But it is definitely something that Lowell, I and the team are very focused on that we need to turn here in the future. And then on the iPhone LTE mix, the iPhone upgrade to new is pretty consistent with the first quarter, 22% to 23% new and the rest were upgrades.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Phil Cusick from JPMorgan.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Wondering if we could dig in a little bit on the handsets. First, if you could talk about the smartphone mix of handsets overall. At the beginning of the year, we talked about that going up to 50%, and it doesn't look like it's going to quite make it. Do you see anything in the second half to sort of ramp up that upgrade rate to get smartphones higher? And then second, if you could help us on the LTE of 1.2 million, can you give us any kind of breakout between phones and data devices?", "Lowell McAdam", "Let me take the first part of that one. I think, Phil, the handset and smartphone mix, we like the gross add mix that we see coming in here. We're in a roughly 60% kind of range. We are probably what I would view as maybe a quarter behind what we had talked about in January, primarily because we expected an iPhone 5 refresh sometime this summer. We don't know when the next one's going to come out. You'll have to ask Apple that, but we expect that probably sometime in the fall. And I think you'll see a significant jump there when we get to that point. On the LTE side, I can't tell you how pleased I am at how the device manufacturers have stepped up with all kinds of devices, and we're beginning to see, even in the machine-to-machine space, LTE modules because the latency is so much better than we have in a 3G environment. Our fourth quarter lineup is going to be very robust, and you've seen -- you've gotten a little bit of a peek at that through devices like the Samsung Charge. The screen density is significantly better than what we've seen in the past. So I think we're going to have, probably in my entire career, the best fourth quarter lineup of devices I've seen, which will shift that mix that you talked about.", "Francis Shammo", "And then, Phil, on the -- just the breakout of LTE. What I will say -- because I'm not going to break out individual devices here, but what I will say is if you take our 4G devices and our Apple device, it accounted for 69% of our net adds for the quarter. So that is definitely executed in the strategy that we laid out for our growth this year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael McCormack of Nomura.", "Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd.", "Just maybe digging a little deeper on the Wireline enterprise trends. Can you give us some sense for what you're seeing at the customer level as far as demand goes and then also in the competitive environment, the pricing behavior among the bigger carriers? And then on the wholesale side, do you guys anticipate that you can get that revenue stream to something that's more flattish over time given the changes you've made? And then I guess, lastly, on the cash flow side, Fran, what should we be thinking about -- it's probably a little early to be discussing this, but the employee retirement benefits on a going-forward basis and then deferred taxes given bonus depreciation rolling off?", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, Mike, so on the enterprise side and the trends, I think what we're seeing is we're continuing to see improvement in our trends from an overall business perspective. And obviously with the Terremark acquisition, we've really put a sounding board out there for ourselves in the cloud space, and you saw that we split out that revenue of Terremark, which grew almost 30% year-over-year. So I think that strategy is there. What we're seeing, quite honestly, is a lot of enterprise customers are coming to us and asking us what solutions do we have in order to cut their costs. And obviously, a strategy around cloud is really the pivotal point of how we can cut enterprise cost. Now the major concern they obviously have is around the security of that cloud, and we think that being #1 in security and the portfolio that we have from our Cybertrust acquisition and what we just acquired from Terremark, we really do believe we're second to none in the marketplace as far as security expertise. So I think that is starting to build momentum here on the overall enterprise place and also on a global basis for us. On the wholesale side, as I said, this International Voice you saw this quarter, we declined down to 7.4% from where we were about 11% in the last 2 quarters. I think we'll continue to make progress there as we get back to an apples-to-apples comparison. And as I said before, I'm kind of bullish to had said if these trends continue, I do still think that in the fourth quarter, we could be back on a positive growth for the entire Wireline segment for us. And then, from a cash flow perspective and income tax and all that, that was all built into our forecast for free cash flow. As I said in the first quarter, we were low because of some timing-related issues. We came back to the range I gave, and I'm confident that with the decrease in our capital spend, we will deliver higher cash flow in the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jonathan Chaplin of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Jonathan Chaplin - JPMorgan", "Two quick questions, if I may. So as you strengthen your operating relationship with Vodafone, can you get all the benefits that there are to extract from that relationship just with this kind of a partnership? Or would there be merits to potentially think about combining these companies at some point in the future? And secondly, just going back to the smartphone question for a second. It looks like your share of the smartphone market is coming in a little weaker than we expected. I'm wondering how much you think AT&T offering a $50 iPhone sort of dampened your capture of the smartphone market. And it sounds like you think with the launch of an iPhone 5 and a strong lineup of devices in the fourth quarter, you should really see your smartphone share accelerate. I just want to see if -- make sure that, that's what you expect.", "Lowell McAdam", "Okay, so there's a lot in there too, Jonathan. So I don't have a lot more to say on the smartphone versus what I said earlier. I do think it's about a quarter behind what we had talked about in January. So given that the delay of the iPhone 5 is more than a quarter, I think we've actually performed quite well. AT&T is a strong competitor, and they've done a lot of things to be a strong competitor. But I like porting ratios. I like our growth rate versus theirs, so I think what you're see is a result of a very dynamic market. Regarding Vodafone, look, I don't see a combination here. I think that we can do what we need to do. There's -- in our markets, they can do what they need to do. In their markets, we can leverage each other's scale, but I would not send any kind of messages here that something like that's immediately on the horizon. I think we need to show that we can do a good operating partnership here. And Vittorio and I see a ton of opportunities in that particular area, and we'll cross whatever bridges are ahead of us when we get to them.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital.", "James Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital", "Two quick, if I could, one on Wireless. Are you expecting to see any churn impact from launching a situated pricing as customers become loathe to give that up by moving to another carrier? And secondly, can you talk through a little bit about what margin impact you're seeing from the growth of FiOS both leveraging the existing infrastructure regarding revenue and offsetting the higher operating costs associated with a larger portion of revenue coming from video?", "Lowell McAdam", "James, let me take the question on tiered pricing, and then Fran can come back and talk about the margins. In my view is that tiered pricing is like gravity. The industry has to get there because there is not unlimited spectrum. And when you look at the utility of the devices that we offer and the video demand that is going to be hitting the devices, it's inevitable. Now each carrier will be in a slightly different position because of their spectrum holdings and their capacity on their networks. So I think over time, there may be some that hold out longer with unlimited, and I wouldn't be surprised if unlimited comes back in and out from a promotional perspective for carriers to balance growth. But in my view, it is -- as I said, like it's inevitable. So do I expect to see some churn impacts? Sure. There will be some users that are very high users that will want to move between carriers to find whatever opportunities they can to continue that. But our strength has always been the best network and the best customer service, and at 2 gigs, well over 95% of our customers are underneath that demand. So I don't think there will be tremendous disruption.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, and then, James, on the FiOS margin, what I will say is that we will continue to make improvements operationally in the FiOS, whether it be on the capital cost of passing a home and a capital cost of connecting the home. And then operationally, we are still performing very, very well compared to core especially around repair and maintenance because the FiOS network operates pretty efficiently. So I think overall, what I will disclose is that FiOS margins continue to improve. I think it's based on 2 things. One is we are very concentrated on the top line growth of our revenue per customer. We have launched Flex View. We've re-bundled where you can build your own bundle now, and we're seeing some nice uptick in people varying whether they want higher speed or less bundling in TV packages and now also with our forthcoming release of our connected home product around security and energy monitoring and electricity and all. So I think it's twofold. It's the operational cost efficiency and building the top line growth of FiOS.", "Lowell McAdam", "Thanks to all of you for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo. ", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. ", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website. ", "For the third quarter of 2011, we reported earnings of $0.49 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $201 million or $0.07 per share for non-operational charge for pension-related items, primarily comprised of actuarial remeasurement losses related to employees who received lump sum distributions in connection with previously announced separation plans. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.56, bringing our year-to-date total to $1.63. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with some brief comments. We had another quarter of solid execution and earnings performance. Adjusted earnings were higher than the same quarter last year and would have been higher sequentially were it not for some extraordinary and, hopefully, nonrecurring challenges this quarter. In spite of this additional pressure from the storms and the strike, which had about a $0.05 impact on EPS in the quarter, we remain on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth in adjusted earnings per share off a base of $2.08 in 2010.", "In terms of cash generation, we had a strong quarter with disciplined capital spending, resulting in a solid increase in free cash flow. I'd also highlight that our Board of Directors approved a 2.6% dividend increase in September, which on an annual basis is an increase from $1.95 to $2 per share. This marked the fifth consecutive year of dividend increases, a testament to our board's confidence in the sustainability of our cash flows.", "We are very pleased with our progress in the key strategic areas which are the platforms for sustainable growth. In Wireless, we continue to perform extremely well, and we are further enhancing our leadership in 4G LTE. In addition to making great progress and extending our network capabilities to more markets, we are seeing increasing customer demand for smartphones, tablets and Internet devices that take advantage of the superior speeds of our LTE network. In FiOS, we continued to steadily increase penetration on all our markets. By further penetrating existing markets, we will enhance our capital and operating efficiency and improve overall investment returns. In the Enterprise space, we are getting some traction in spite of the macroeconomic challenges. We are having productive dialogue with many large customers and secured new agreements for Strategic Services during the quarter with RWE of Germany, Smile Brands and the University of North Carolina, to name a few. ", "Our competitive position in the cloud space has been bolstered by the acquisition of Terremark earlier this year and, more recently, with the addition of CloudSwitch, a well-known Software-as-a-Service provider. A number of multinational companies, including ORINK, adopted our cloud services during the quarter.", "Some segment-specific highlights are on Slide 4. In Wireless, we had another excellent quarter with strong growth in retail customers, revenue and ARPU accretion. Our performance with respect to margin, churn and free cash flow was extremely strong in the third quarter. In fact, our Wireless service EBITDA margin of 47.8% is the highest we have ever reported since the formation of Verizon Wireless in the year 2000.", "In Wireline, an unprecedented series of storms caused power outages and severe flooding in nearly every part of our landline footprint, causing a significant increase in repair and maintenance costs. In addition, the 2-week strike in August delayed new FiOS installations and, together with the storms, created a sharp increase in our FiOS sales order backlog. The storms also created delays in some order provisioning with Enterprise customers. The impact of these factors caused a 250 basis point decline in the Wireline EBITDA margin this quarter. ", "In spite of these challenges, we did increase penetration in both FiOS Internet and TV. In addition, we continued to improve our overall Wireline revenue mix with FiOS representing nearly 60% of consumer revenue and Strategic Services nearly 50% of Enterprise revenue. All things considered, we had a solid performance under some tough circumstances. ", "Let's now move to our more detailed review of the quarter, starting with Slide 5. Our top line growth trends continue to be very positive with solid growth in all strategic areas: Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services. Consolidated revenue in the third quarter increased to $27.9 billion or 5.4% year-over-year. Through 9 months, adjusted revenue growth was 5.6%. Consolidated EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $9.2 billion, up 4.1% year-over-year. Obviously, this growth was adversely affected by Wireline this quarter. Earnings for the quarter were $0.49 per share with $0.07 of non-operational charges related to pensions and benefits. So our $0.56 adjusted result compares favorably with our first 2 quarters of this year, especially when you consider that it includes about $0.05 of storm and strike impact. Through 9 months, our $1.63 per share represents a 5.8% increase in adjusted EPS on a comparable basis with last year. Again, our year-to-date performance confirms the strength of the business and the path that we are on to create long-term shareholder value. ", "Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow this quarter increased by $1.9 billion or 59% sequentially, driven by a double-digit increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. So far, we've invested $12.5 billion in capital through 9 months, and we are on track to meet our full year guidance of $16.5 billion, which is equal to the amount we spent last year. Our CapEx-to-revenue ratio in the third quarter was 13%, a 350 basis point improvement sequentially and 260 basis points better year-over-year. In Wireless, capital spending in the third quarter totaled $1.8 billion, which was significantly less than the $2.7 billion spend in each of the first 2 quarters of this year. As we said, second half spending will be lower than the first half, particularly with regard to 3G capacity. ", "Our 4G LTE deployment is going very well, and we are now providing service in 165 markets, covering more than 186 million PoPs. With additional markets planned in November and December, we are actually ahead of schedule and have already exceeded our year-end target of 185 million PoPs. ", "In Wireline, capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled $1.6 billion. Year-to-date, Wireline capital spending of $4.8 billion was 6.5% lower than last year. We've generated $9 billion in free cash flow for the first 9 months. And our outlook for the balance of the year remains very strong, especially in light of the lower capital requirements.", "The sustainability of this cash flow underpins our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. You will recall that in late July, the Verizon Wireless Board of Representatives declared a distribution of $10 billion to its owners, payable on January 31, 2012. In addition, as I highlighted earlier, our board recently approved a dividend increase for the fifth consecutive year. Our financial position is strong from a balance sheet perspective. Net debt at the end of September was $44.6 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is about 1.3x. ", "Let's now move into our review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter with solid growth in postpaid connections, the highest retail service revenue growth we've seen since the second quarter of 2009 and faster growth in retail postpaid ARPU. In addition, our industry-leading EBITDA service margin improved to a record high 47.8%. Total revenue grew to $17.7 billion in the quarter, up 9.1% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 6.9% year-over-year, 140 basis points higher than the 5.5% growth we reported in the second quarter. Postpaid service revenue, which represents 98% of retail service, grew 7.2% year-over-year. Total service revenue grew 6.1% year-over-year. This rate of growth was impacted by a $61 million year-over-year decline in other service, which is primarily roaming and wholesale revenue. Total data revenue grew to $6.1 billion in the quarter, up 20.5% year-over-year. Data now represents 40.6% of our total service revenue. Growth continued to be driven by web and e-mail services, which increased to $3.7 billion this quarter, up more than 36% from a year ago. Messaging, which makes up just under 1/3 of data revenue, grew at just over 5% on a year-over-year basis. ", "Let's take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 8. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market and lead in 4G LTE. Retail customer growth continues to be driven by steady demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices and, of course, on the reliability of our premier network. During the third quarter, we added over 1.3 million total connections: 882,000 were retail postpaid net adds, 86,000 were retail prepaid and roughly 367,000 were wholesale and other connections. Importantly, 52% of the retail postpaid net adds in the quarter were 4G LTE smartphones and Internet devices, up from 30% in the second quarter. Our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer was only available nationwide since September 15, which was not long enough to affect the quarter. We are optimistic that this will help our retail prepaid performance in the fourth quarter. ", "Total devices, both gross adds and upgrades, while relatively strong, were down about 5% sequentially this quarter, due primarily to customer anticipation of the next version of the Apple iPhone. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled $3.3 million, up about 3% year-over-year but lower sequentially.", "The percentage of customers upgrading was also lower than the prior 2 quarters. The continued demand for our Wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty. Our churn metrics this quarter were once again excellent with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, a 13 basis point improvement over the same quarter last year. ", "Next, let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU. We continue to make progress in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the smartphone penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 39% from 36% last quarter. A year ago, that penetration was 24%. We sold 5.6 million smartphones in the quarter, representing 60% of all postpaid phone sales compared with 43% a year ago. More than half of the total smartphones sold this quarter were Android phones, either 3G or 4G. Another 35% or 2 million were iPhones, bringing our year-to-date total to 6.5 million. We anticipate that the strong demand we're seeing for the new iPhone 4S will bring even more new customers to the nation's most reliable wireless network.", "We sold a total of 1.4 million 4G LTE devices in the quarter. Just over 1/2 of these were smartphones, and the rest were Internet data devices. Shifting now to ARPU, retail postpaid ARPU was $54.89, up 2.4% year-over-year, which is a 50 basis point improvement in growth from last quarter. Keep in mind that, that is a blended metric. Retail postpaid phone ARPU is about $56 and grew 3.7% year-over-year, showing good accretion from 3.2% growth last quarter.", "Internet data devices have an ARPU of about $49. While the growth of these devices is deluding our postpaid ARPU growth at this time, expanding this category remains a key strategic focus for us. We continue to see strong demand for our 4G LTE mobile hotspot devices and PC cards as well as tablets. This category of devices represents nearly 8% of all our retail postpaid subscriber base. I would also note that these data-only devices typically carry a much lower subsidy than phones, so they have a very short payback period and contribute to profitability fairly quickly. In addition, the migration of data traffic from our 3G to our 4G network will enhance our capital and operating efficiency and will help us drive improved returns going forward.", "Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the third quarter, we generated $7.2 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 7.5% year-over-year and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 240 basis points sequentially to 47.8%. This is an extraordinarily strong result. Our margin improvement goes beyond the fact that device sales were lower this quarter. Higher retail service revenue and our intense focus on cost efficiency are clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. In addition, we continue to lead the industry in customer loyalty, which we believe is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. We continue to execute very well on our strategy of increasing growth and profitability.", "Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. As I said earlier, the third quarter posed challenges to the Wireline business, and as a result, some of our key financial performance metrics were adversely affected. Setting aside these impacts, total Wireline revenue in the quarter remained steady. Consumer revenue grew 1.1% year-over-year with FiOS revenue up 18.5%. In Global Enterprise, revenue growth was 2.1% year-over-year, driven by Strategic Services growth of 15.6%. Strategic Services are becoming a much larger portion of our revenue mix, now representing nearly 50% of total Enterprise.", "From a profitability perspective, segment EBITDA in the quarter decreased $160 million or 6.9% year-over-year. We've estimated that the storms and the strike cost us $250 million in the quarter, causing the Wireline EBITDA margin to decline sequentially to 21.4%. ", "Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12. Consumer revenues were $3.4 billion, up 1.1% versus last year. Consumer ARPU continued to increase and is now over $94. Residential access line loss this quarter was 8% compared with 9.6% a year ago. FiOS now represents nearly 60% of consumer revenue. The increasing scale of the FiOS platform is significant enough to more than offset the secular and competitive pressures in the consumer landline business. The storms and the strike caused customer growth in FiOS to be lower than prior quarters. In FiOS TV, we added 131,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4 million and increasing our penetration to 31%. On the broadband side, we added 138,000 new FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our FiOS Internet customer base to 4.6 million, representing 35% penetration of homes open for sale. By adding in our 4 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.6 million broadband connections adding a net positive 20,000 broadband connections this quarter. ", "While we always have a healthy FiOS pipeline, our installation backlog spiked to roughly 1.8x at its peak in early September. We ended the quarter at about 1.2x our typical pipeline and have been actively working through these orders in October. In the fourth quarter, we expect to add more than 200,000 FiOS Internet and TV subscribers. ", "Let's move next to our business markets on Slide 13. In Global Enterprise, increases in Strategic Services continued to drive year-over-year revenue improvement, led by a very strong growth in advanced services such as Managed Network, Call Center, IP Communications and our cloud offerings. The inclusion of Terremark added about $100 million to revenue this quarter. As a result of our improving sales mix, the absolute dollar growth in Strategic Services once again outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Service. ", "International revenue, which makes up approximately 15% of Global Enterprise, grew 9.8% year-over-year. In Global Wholesale, while revenues declined 9% year-over-year, the rate of decline is moderating on a sequential basis. As we've discussed, our route rationalization strategy resulted in a substantial decline in International Voice revenue, which has impacted year-over-year comparisons. We made these price changes in 2010 and have one more quarter to work through before the comparative impact of these actions moderates. In the third quarter, this accounted for a revenue decline of about $90 million year-over-year. Absent these effects, second quarter Global Wholesale revenues declined 5.8% year-over-year. This decline is primarily in Domestic Voice, where we continue to experience secular pressures and lower usage volumes. ", "I will wrap up now on Slide 14. Back in January when we talked about our 2011 priorities, I said this year would be all about execution. Now that we are 3 quarters through the year, our results demonstrate solid execution on our strategy. We are on track to meet our guidance for revenue and earnings growth as well as capital spending in spite of the challenges that impacted us in the third quarter. We have great momentum in Wireless, and we expect to build on that strength. We are geared up for an exciting fourth quarter with a host of new smartphones, tablets and data devices coming to the market. Earlier this week, we announced the DROID RAZR by Motorola, the world's thinnest 4G LTE smartphone. In FiOS, we expect to get back on track quickly, driving higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capturing pent-up demand in new markets.", "In the Enterprise space, we are also gaining momentum as a leading global provider in the information technology solutions space. The integration of Terremark and the recent acquisition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position. We now have a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure that allowed Terremark to achieve a record new sales bookings in the third quarter. More and more, CIOs are recognizing the value of our Enterprise solutions, which is helping us to effectively manage through some pockets of economic pressure in the small and midsized business markets. ", "Our financial objective is to continue to increase free cash flow through improved operating performance, disciplined capital spending and the efficient use of working capital. Our balance sheet is strong, and we have very competitive dividend. ", "With that, I will turn it back to John so we can get to your questions.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Fran, a couple of questions. First on Wireless, if we look at retail service growth, I think, as you mentioned, up 6.9%, that's a big step up sequentially. But when we look at the total service growth line, up 6.1%, I think that's been weighed down a bit as you mentioned by roaming. Can you just help us think through that and what some of that pressure -- or when some of that pressure might abate? And then second question, just on Wireline margins, sort of excluding the storm and the strike costs, were up 10 basis points sequentially. That's the fourth straight quarter we've seen sequential improvement. As we look forward, can margins expand further from here? What's the outlook?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Jason, so first, let's talk about the Wireless segment on the service revenue. So overall, 6.1%, that was down from 6.6% in the second quarter. Before I get to that explanation, just a couple of things to highlight here. As you mentioned, the retail service revenue from 5.6% to 6.9% and then retail postpaid from 6.2% to 7.2%. And as you recall back in the second quarter, I reiterated that we were on a glide path to accelerate our ARPU growth and our revenue growth into the third quarter, and I continue to see that ramp going into the fourth quarter. Now as far as service revenue goes, we did have a $61 million decline in wholesale and other, and the majority of this was all related to the Alltel properties and that traffic moving off of our network. So as far as going forward, that traffic's gone. But just keep in mind that, that revenue stream is less than 4% of our total revenue, so it really has no impact on the bottom line per se. And that's why we're focused in on the entire postpaid base area. Now as far as Wireline goes, what I would say is that when you consider the storms and all that and then from a perspective of the backlog that we have both on the FiOS side and also the Enterprise side, this leads into what will continue into the fourth quarter. And I think we've been very clear that both Lowell and I\u2019s objective is to improve the overall profitability and cash flow of the Wireline unit. And what I would say is, is that we will increase the margin in the fourth quarter. I think there will be some echo effect here from the backlog on a top line basis in booking that revenue. Now having said that, Terremark did have an outstanding September, and that revenue will flow in the fourth quarter. So at this point, I think it's too early to tell exactly where we'll end up. We started to recover from the storms on the installations side in the last 3 weeks of the third quarter. FiOS adds actually came in better than we thought. Originally, we thought we would be about a 50% run rate. We came in higher than that. So we're starting to eat into that backlog, and it's a fact of how quickly we can get there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I guess maybe a follow-up to Jason's last question there. Could you give us more detail on the FiOS sense of storm-related costs and maybe break that out a bit? And I guess similar to his question, I guess you're suggesting that we're going to see some our expenses in 4Q given the backlog. I'm just trying to get a sense of if the margins in 4Q snap back to 2Q levels or what the depth will be. And then I guess while we're still talking about margins, you benefited from somewhat fewer upgrades, fewer smartphone sales. As we look in the margin on the Wireless side on the 4Q, should we expect that to reverse given the sort of people waiting for the iPhone and then the typical seasonality we see in 4Q? If you could just give us a sense of how you expect that to fall in the fourth quarter, that would be great.", "Francis J. Shammo", "John, so thanks for the question on the storms. As you know, this was an experience unprecedented from Hurricane Irene and the Tropical Storm Lee over a very short period of time. And speaking with our operating people, these storms were a really big deal for us. They produced really strong winds, about 20 inches of rain across our entire footprint, damage to our outside network facilities, phone lines. Just to give you an idea of how severe this storm was, we had over 4,000 poles down, which damaged countless cables; 820,000 more dispatches in our core, which was 2x our normal; we had about 254 central offices running off of generator because of power outages. So this storm was extremely significant impact to our normal operating results. Having said that, I think the team has done an unbelievable job in getting the repair and maintenance queue back into a relatively normal position. There's probably a couple of more weeks here, and then we'll be back running very clean there. And as I said, we recovered late in the third quarter from an installation perspective, but there will be some trickle effect here into the fourth quarter, and it's more of a top line issue, I think, in getting this revenue installed and booked and recorded than it is more of an expense issue, although I think there still will be some trickle of overtime into the fourth quarter in getting this back to speed. But the trajectory, I guess the way I would say it is we've been on a very good momentum in improving the overall Wireline margin. We've had a bit of a setback here due to the storm. We'll get back on track. As far as the Wireless margin goes, what I would say there is this goes beyond just less devices sold. This is -- we had a $1.8 billion program at the beginning of the year for Wireless to reduce cost. We're $1.6 billion into that program of savings recorded from logistics and real estate and customer service centers and other things that Wireless has worked on. So it's more just around less devices. It's more around operating the most efficient business in the industry from a Wireless perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Quickly, just a follow-up on John's comment and then a bigger question. With Wireline margins maybe dragged a little bit in terms of rebound in the fourth quarter and Wireless probably down in 4Q, first, you reiterated EPS guidance, but should we be thinking sort of low end there? And is there any risk to the low end of that? And then second, in terms of a bigger question, can you talk about what you're seeing from customers and the economy? We have seen -- Enterprise decelerated a little bit here. Wholesale, you talked about it improving sequentially, but what are you seeing out there in terms of what your customers are telling you, both for this year and then their planning process for next year?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Phil, so let me hit the economy first. I think that overall from an economic impact, we are still seeing some real severe impact in the small business arena, some in the mid-tier. And again, it's not that we're losing more business competitors. That's pretty consistent. What it is, is that the startups have not been created from an economic standpoint. So I think that's where the biggest issue is that we have from an economic standpoint. Now having said that, the Enterprise, if you recall, the first and second quarter, we showed positive growth even when you take out Terremark. This quarter, we showed growth with Terremark, about a 0.5% decrease without Terremark, and that was really more around the backlog of installing the new circuits and the new business because we were really focused on the repairs and maintenance side. So that's going to -- I think we\u2019re going to improve here on the fourth quarter. We'll get quickly back on track, but from an overall Enterprise perspective, it is all around cloud services. So the Terremark asset, our security portfolio, those types of things are going to drive the Enterprise business to where we needed to go. And then overall on EPS, what I'll say is, even given this extraordinary event in the third quarter, we will hit our guidance that we gave in the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wonder if you could update us on the labor negotiations, where we stand on that and, in particular, as we come to the end of the year, the sort of the benefits outlook. Perhaps you can expand on the $0.07 charge and just talk us through what you think the impacts in the fourth quarter might be given the asset returns and given potential benefit changes as part of the union contract renegotiation.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Simon, as far as the union negotiations go, we continue to speak to the union. It's going like any negotiation goes, so as we said, this was going to be a marathon, not a quick negotiation, and we continue with those negotiations. And at this point, it's too early to tell where we'll come out. We know what we need from a business. We need cost structural change in the Wireline business. It is not sustainable with 100% benefits being paid and 100% pension benefits. So those things have to change. And then there's a lot of work rules and other things that we need to change in order to run our business efficiently and be competitive with the cable companies and our other competitors. So from that perspective, that's about it for the union negotiations. On the fourth quarter charge, it's really too early to tell because the discount rate won't be set until December 31. The return on assets, it really depends on your portfolio compared to what your assumptions were, and at this point, we don't know where we'll end up with that yet. So I think it's premature to tell, but obviously, there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in the fourth quarter. So beyond that, there's really nothing else to disclose until we get to the end of the year and we get to the January call, and we'll make sure that we explain everything that happened during that quarter.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And the $0.07, Fran?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Well on the $0.07, this was an impact we had to take a charge in the management plan, and it's really around the GAAP settlement accounting charges. So it is what it is from a GAAP perspective, and it's because the lump sum payments exceeded the periodic expense and in GAAP you have to take a settlement charge when that happens, and that happened this year -- during the quarter, I'm sorry.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Fran, we've all seen the big number that AT&T has put out with the iPhone 4S, and I know the iPhone is clearly, as you indicated, an important part of your portfolio. But as we look at this kind of next generation of the device, how do you see it? Because with just over a third-year base having smartphones, in my view you have a clear opportunity for upgrades. So with this device, as other iPhone users come off contract it also gives you a huge opportunity to maybe win back some new gross adds that maybe you lost when AT&T first had it. And can you just comment as you look at this mix of this device, how do you balance those 2 opportunities?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, so as far as the iPhone 4S goes, we are extremely pleased with our sales. We ran out the first day. We are on allocation from Apple. We continue to be on allocation, and we continue to be in backlog from the first 24 hours. So we're extremely pleased with that. What I will tell you, I'm not going to get into volumes. It's too early in the quarter as to how many phones I'll potentially sell. But what I will say is that the ratio of upgrade and new on the Apple phone has not changed pre and post launch. So we continue to generate that 20% new with around 80% upgrade. So we feel that third quarter performance will continue into our fourth quarter performance. And then from an overall device perspective is that the lead that we have around LTE 4G and the 15 devices including notebooks that we have in that ecosystem is unsurpassed by any competitor. And I think we have a strategic advantage here, and we sold more 4G devices this quarter than we did last quarter. I will tell you that if you look at our Internet devices, about 95% are all now 4G LTE, and that's a big deal for us because that means we are now moving high-end users on MiFi and dongles off of 3G network on to 4G, which obviously frees up spectrum and reduces our capital expense, which you saw here in the third quarter. So we're executing on the strategy that we laid out, and I think we'll have a very successful fourth quarter with our portfolio layout of devices.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Real quick, can we just get an update as to where the Wireless net debt is at the end of this third quarter? And then secondly, going back to the Wireline side, can you give us a bit of an update on where the non-FiOS territory stands in terms of performance, your need or interest to invest further in that footprint, to improve broadband capabilities and where that piece of the portfolio sits strategically for you?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Michael, so from a net debt on Wireless, they have gross debt of $12.5 billion, cash on hand of $9 billion. Net debt is $3.5 billion. On the Wireline side in the non-FiOS areas, obviously, our strategy is to complete the $18 million build for FiOS and transition that. And as you know, we've really concentrated on investing in FiOS and curtailing the investment in the copper network and moving people from copper to FiOS. And that is a big strategic initiative that Lowell has set out for the business to accomplish. Now those lines that are outside that FiOS and outside of any potential of pathing [ph] ever with FiOS, we will continue to be competitive in this area, but I think it's going to be around LTE. We're not going to invest a lot of capital in the copper core network in those outlying areas. But I think we have a strategic bundle that we can go into those households with, give them a better experience than what they're currently having on their DSL line from a bundling of the Wireless portfolio that we have. So that's the strategy that we're going to deploy.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And, Fran, just to follow-up on that, is there any thought of taking that non-FiOS bundle with the -- presumably LTE broadband, LTE voice, why not taking that more nationally and making that more of a national product for you versus just maybe an out-of-FiOS region but in-territory-of-Verizon product?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Well, we are, and you're going to see that come in the fourth quarter with the -- what we now call the cantenna, which is not a commercial name, obviously, but it's the antenna that we actually trialed with DIRECTV, which was extremely successful. And again, the benefit of this antenna is it operates the spectrum extremely efficiently. So if you look at a MiFi card or a dongle, this is very, very efficient, way above those 2 devices, which is why it's critical to have that bundle with that cantenna. So when we launch that, you're going to see us go nationally with that type of an offer.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Fran, if I can just do 2 quick ones. Number one, are you able at this stage of the game to maybe size the upside opportunity that you guys have from this potential intercarrier comp refresh that we're expecting to come potentially at the end of the month and get implemented next year? And then second, you called out the Alltel roaming impact in the quarter. Obviously, Sprint has a game plan where over the next 2 years, they're saying that they want to get rid of about $1 billion in roaming expense from refreshing their network. Could you kind of tell us what your exposure to Sprint is and how you think about the roaming impact on 2012 and beyond?", "Francis J. Shammo", "David, so first on the intercarrier comp, and I guess I'll lump in the USF here as well, we are fully supportive of the regulatory change the FCC is heading up, not exactly what the industry is looking at but really in the right direction of cutting the access charges immediately and then phasing them out over time. Complete overhaul of the USF cost subsidy, promoting broadband and getting away from the voice subsidy and moving that to broadband, so we are all in favor of that. As far as the intercarrier comp goes, we have been a leader in this industry forcing this issue really from twofold: one, to get a more systematic approach in the entire industry; and then also to really relieve the industry of the fraud and the traffic pumping schemes that are happening with that -- throughout. So from a benefit overall perspective, we are a net payer, so obviously, there will be some benefits. But there will also be some puts and takes within our own portfolio. So if you think about it, Wireline probably won't have a benefit, but Wireless and VZB will. So with each of the individual units, once we determine what the impact of the bill -- of the regulation is and the sizing of that, then we'll have a better understanding of what those benefits are, and we'll share them at that time. As far as the Alltel roaming and then into Sprint, I know there's been a lot of numbers cast out there, but the impact to us is nowhere near the numbers that are being reported. So all I will tell you is this, is that there has to be a lot of execution in order for that to happen. Our revenue is not material at all from Sprint. So I think that there's a lot of numbers being thrown out but not a lot of justification behind the number that's being thrown out, especially from where I sit on my side of the house. So I think we'll just have to wait and see what the execution of that plan is, but I don't think this is a near-term issue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "You talked earlier about how some of the margin strength you saw in Wireless during the quarter was not just a function of a slowdown in gross adds you had in the iPhone but also some of the cost measures you\u2019ve put in place. If we think ahead though, you will probably see a pretty meaningful improvement in your gross adds in the fourth quarter. I mean, just by way of thinking about this from order of magnitude, if you were to end up in the fourth quarter with a high watermark for postpaid net adds, does that mean you would be at a low watermark for EBITDA margins? Or have you actually put in place enough operational cost savings that you could come in a little bit better than that?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Well, Brett, I think I'll reiterate what I said at the beginning of the year. We're going to have peaks and valleys here as phones come and phones go. Obviously, the fourth quarter every year, due to holiday season, we tend to sell more phones. When we sell more phones, our margins will go down, but I think we've proven that even with the initial launch and now into the -- where we are, we have managed both sides of the balance here. We've gone for growth. We are very concentrated on profitability and a free cash flow, so I think we'll wait and see how the fourth quarter comes out. But look, I mean, obviously, we are extremely focused on the profitability and the free cash flow of this business, so we will continue to be disciplined around capital and so forth and deliver what we need to deliver.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just one quick point there since you mentioned cash flow. Maybe I missed it but I don't think you talked about your CapEx outlook for the rest of the year. I think you said previously, you'll be flat. Year-over-year, are you still looking for that or maybe a little lighter based on where you are with Wireless?", "Francis J. Shammo", "The guidance was $16.5 billion, and I said that we would decelerate in the back half of the year, and we are still right on track to deliver at that $16.5 billion. So if you do the math for the fourth quarter, you'll see that Wireless will be about maybe slightly higher than it was in the third quarter but not much. And Wireline will be right on track, so $16.5 billion is where we'll end up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities.", "Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Fran, could you just make a comment -- AT&T is out there with -- I guess they ran out of inventory but probably getting more in 4Q on the 3GS for free and also the lower price on the iPhone 4. Do you guys have any thoughts on sort of the competitive landscape going into or -- we\u2019re already in 4Q, but on trying to meet some of those offerings that AT&T is with -- is out there with? And then secondarily, maybe just some commentary around your customers that signed up and have contracts on the iPhone 4. What is the behavior there? Are they coming back to you looking for an upgrade of the 4S and how are you reacting to that?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Two things, Mike. I mean, obviously, as we have said and continue to say in the past, when we compete on a paratable [ph] basis, we outperform and have outperformed the entire industry, and we don't think that will change, so we will compete extremely heavily even with the -- another provider getting the Apple iPhone. It doesn't really concern us. We will compete, and when we compete head-to-head, we generally win in that competition. So we'll continue to out-execute where we can and continue to deliver both profits and cash flow. The other thing is, is that if you look at the net adds, I mean, obviously, that speaks for itself, and we believe that, that will continue into the fourth quarter. Now as far as customers on the 4 -- the Apple 4 and the 4S, no, what we're seeing is that, as you know, the Apple 4 can be upgraded with software to almost get to almost 95% of what the S has in it. Now it's a long process to get that software upgrade in the phone, but 4 customers have come in and asked for the upgrade, and that's how we're handling that.", "Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Just one more if I can. On the Digital Voice connections, kind of a random question, but Digital Voice connections were 265,000 in the quarter, which was much higher than FiOS Internet and TV. Is there some sort of promotion you're running there? Or how should we think about that?", "Francis J. Shammo", "No, again, Mike, this goes to our strategy of moving people to the new technology, and there's really a 2-phased approach here. As we move people to FiOS, obviously, our operating cost structure gets benefited by almost 2x because the amount of truck rolls that I have on copper versus FiOS is about 2x. So by moving those customers off copper on to digital FiOS, I eliminate that copper truck roll into that home. So it is all around the strategy of eliminating the amount of folks I have on copper and the reduction of our operating expenses in the Wireline business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Chris Larsen of Piper Jaffray.", "Christopher M. Larsen - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "A couple of questions on Wireless as well. One of the things I think that you guys have looked at doing to help margins is extend the upgrade rates, and I know we've had questions on the iPhone, but can you talk a little bit about some of the things that you've done including eliminating the 2 every new (sic) [New Every Two] program and where your upgrade -- months to upgrade has been moving? And then secondly, I saw that -- it looks like prepaid, a nice or decent growth here this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about the competitive environment around prepaid and what's going on there?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Chris, so on the upgrade rates, we were actually at 8.6% this quarter, so that was slightly down from the past 2 quarters of 9%. So the upgrade rate is pretty much steady as course -- in the course. The decline in the upgrade rate this quarter was due to the people anticipating the new iPhone. But from a change of policy, we changed that midyear last year where we eliminated the New Every Two credit and some other things that we did, and we really haven't found any impact to the upgrade. What we have found is that not much financial benefit this year, but there will be more financial benefit in 2012 by the change of that policy, so we think that was beneficial for us from a longer-term perspective. On the prepaid side of the house, we are starting to see some momentum here. As you know, we launched the Unleashed product on 9/15, which was the same time that we entered into our new distribution agreement with RadioShack. And really, too preliminary to tell, but I believe that based on the preliminary effects of what happened since we did launch that product, we will see some improvement in prepaid, and I think -- I'm hopeful that if you eliminate the tablets from prepaid, we will actually show some net add positive growth for the first time in a while in our prepaid voice category. So this month -- this quarter, just to clarify, our prepaid voice was down about 52,000. Now that was an improvement from the second quarter, which was 179,000. So the Unleashed product and bringing the distribution of RadioShack has already started to show that improvement in the last 15 days of the quarter, so I think we're going to compete extremely well in the fourth quarter on our Unleashed product.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Jonathan Chaplin - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a clarification, a couple of clarifications actually. First On CapEx, Fran, are we looking for $9.6 billion-ish in Wireless CapEx for this year if 4Q is going to be a little bit above 3Q? And then where does that go for next year just for Wireless specifically? And then in terms of the impacts to wholesale ARPU, was the $60 million all AT&T -- stuff that you divested to AT&T, has it now moved off of your network? Or is it moving revenues from the wholesale category to the retail category within the Alltel subset [ph] that you kept?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Jonathan, so on the CapEx side, the plan that's for Wireless is at the $8.9 billion number, and they'll come in on that number. And as far as next year goes, we're not going to talk about 2012 at this point. From a wholesale perspective, not all $61 million of that was roaming. I said the majority of it was. There was some decline in our reseller base as well, but that was really just the properties of Alltel, that they roamed on us, and now they've converted it to their network. So keep in mind we sold those properties to AT&T, so they're their properties, and they moved that traffic to their network, which we planned for. We knew they were going to do it, so it's not a surprise.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from James Ratcliffe of Barclays Capital.", "James M. Ratcliffe - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "If you could talk a little bit about the ARPU impact on voice you're actually seeing directly connected to operating the smartphones, if customers actually are looking at that as an opportunity to tune their voices and should we expect, as eventually smartphones to move forward into flatter part of the S-curve, that the pressure on voice could abate?", "Francis J. Shammo", "James, actually from a voice perspective, we've actually seen a little bit of an improvement on the dilution of the voice revenue. So we're not seeing any more change right now with people going to smartphones and talking less on the phone. The dilution of that has been pretty consistent, but obviously, the data and the ARPU on the overall customer is increasing. So we had a very nice ARPU increase this quarter, and I expect that to continue into the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from Peter Rhamey of BMO Capital Markets.", "Peter Rhamey - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "Fran, you talked about scaling efficiencies in U-verse as you've curtailed your network deployment and of course, you're only marketing to just 13, 14 million homes right now. I was wondering if you could take us through whether that's going to be a material margin improvement on a go-forward basis in U-verse and whether we'd see it in the consolidated results or is it just directionally a positive for your company on Wireline?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Peter, I'm assuming you're talking about FiOS, right?", "Peter Rhamey - BMO Capital Markets Canada", "FiOS, excuse me. My apologies.", "Francis J. Shammo", "It's all right. Yes, so from a -- just from an overall perspective, the biggest cost content of FiOS is obviously content, but the profitability of FiOS continues to increase quarter-over-quarter as we monitor it. The operating income is continuing to improve, so the operating efficiency of FiOS is there. The issue that Lowell has set out for the business, which is the absolute right strategic decision, is move folks off of copper onto FiOS because the operating efficiency of FiOS is far better than the operating cost of the legacy copper network. So I think as we do that, we will continue to show the momentum of Wireline overall margin improvement going forward.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks for everybody for joining us this morning.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2011 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning, I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is Fran Shammo.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.", "This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "For the fourth quarter of 2011, we reported a loss of $0.71 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a noncash pension and benefits charge of $5.6 billion on a pretax basis. This mark-to-market adjustment related to our current year asset returns, discount rate and mortality assumption changes in our pension and postretirement plans. This adjustment is in accordance with the accounting policy we adopted a year ago, which requires us to recognize actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur and not smooth the effects over a longer period of time. ", "Adjusting for $1.23 per share of nonoperational items, fourth quarter EPS was $0.52, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS to $2.15. The comparable adjusted EPS in 2010 was $2.08. ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone and happy new year. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few summary comments. We finished the year very strong, creating value for our shareholders in 2011 by generating a total return of 18.2% through a combination of stock price appreciation of 12.1% and our dividend payments. Our stock price appreciation outpaced our peers, as well as the S&P, Dow Jones and broader indices. For the fifth consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase, indicating their confidence in the sustainability of our business model, cash flows and our improving earnings profile into 2012 and beyond.", "In 2011, we also made some smart investments for the future growth and improved profitability. While very disciplined in our approach to capital spending, we continue to invest in networks and new technologies, which will be the platform for accelerated growth. ", "On the strategic front, we made some moves that will significantly improve our competitive position. These include the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch in the cloud computing space, several agreements to purchase additional spectrum, joint efforts around innovation with a number of partners including the cable companies and, of course, our continued leadership in the rapid development of the 4G LTE ecosystem. ", "We also renewed our focus on delivering solutions to customers and the markets we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business, wireless, FiOS, Strategic Services, the cloud, digital media and our global high-speed IP network. Our recently formed Global Enterprise solutions organization will strengthen our ability to provide fully integrated customer solutions. ", "In addition to making these investments in our future, 2011 was a great year of solid execution. We posted record revenue growth in the fourth quarter, resulting in adjusted revenue growth of 6.2% for the full year, a significant acceleration from just below 2% growth in 2010. In addition to our strong revenue results, our sharp focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate a number of cost pressures, driving an increase to consolidated EBITDA of more than $950 million. ", "We also had a strong year in terms of cash generation with $13.5 billion in free cash flow. 2011 was an impressive year on a number of fronts, giving us tremendous confidence about our long-term growth prospects.", "Now let's turn our attention to the fourth quarter, starting with a few highlights. ", "As I just noted, we had a very strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter. Our 7.7% year-over-year growth was easily our highest quarterly growth of the year, and in fact, the highest quarterly growth since the formation of Verizon 11 years ago. In wireless, we had our best quarter ever in terms of smartphone sales, 4G LTE device sales and customer upgrades, along with the most retail gross adds in the 3 years. We lead the industry in retail postpaid connections and our 1.2 million postpaid net adds this quarter demonstrates that we continue to gain market share. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 195 markets covering more than 200 million POPs, with increasing customer awareness of its superior speeds, capabilities and new high-quality devices.", "4G LTE is really taking hold. In addition to record device sales in the quarter, we are seeing a high-level activity at our innovation centers in Waltham and San Francisco. We currently offer about 20 4G LTE smartphone and data devices, and at CES, we announced 2 more mobile hotspots now called Jetpacks. Three smartphones: 2 for Motorola and one from LG and the Samsung Galaxy Tablet. Clearly, the Verizon 4G LTE network is becoming the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a strong indicator for us looking forward.", "In Wireline, our revenue mix continues to improve, with FiOS representing 61% of our consumer revenue and enterprise Strategic Services making up 51% of our Global Enterprise revenue in the quarter. We effectively worked through the numerous challenges of the third quarter to restore Wireline segment profitability. Wireline EBITDA increased to $2.4 billion in the quarter, resulting in a 23.8% EBITDA margin, in line with where we ended the second quarter. Now that we are back on track, I am confident that we will see Wireline margin expansion in 2012. Again, a strong finish to a solid year, making us very confident about our growth opportunities in 2012 and beyond.", "Let's turn to Slide 5 next. Fourth quarter consolidated revenues grew 7.7% year-over-year, resulting in adjusted annual growth of 6.2%, solidly within our 2011 guidance range of 4% to 8%. Reported earnings for the fourth quarter on a GAAP basis were a net loss of $0.71 per share due to the significant noncash charge associated with our pension and postretirement plans. The largest component of this actuarial true-up, has to do with our discount rate assumption, which was 5.75% at the beginning of the year. At the end of the year, this rate is adjusted to an estimate of the yields of high-quality long-term bonds, which was determined to be 5%. ", "Another part of this true-up relates to our return on pension assets. We assumed an 8% ROA at the beginning of the year and we came in at 5% for the year. There were also adjustments required based on mortality assumption changes. Excluding non-operational items, we earned $0.52 per share in the quarter, bringing our full year 2011 adjusted EPS result to $2.15, up 3.4% from a comparable $2.08 per share in 2010. ", "Coming out of the third quarter, we indicated that we were on track to meet our 2011 earnings guidance of 5% to 8% growth. Earlier this month, I indicated that a very strong December resulted in higher-than-expected wireless device sales, which sets up well for 2012 but resulted in us falling a little short of our full year EPS growth target by $0.02. I would also remind you that our $2.15 adjusted result included $0.05 of negative impact, primarily from the storms in the third quarter. So from my perspective, an adjusted EPS of $2.20 is a more logical starting point for you when considering our 2012 earnings growth potential.", "Let's turn next to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 6. Our free cash flow in the fourth quarter and full year was once again a combination of strong cash generation and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures for the full year totaled $16.2 billion, representing a decrease of 1.3% from 2010. In addition to being lower than the prior year, the $16.2 billion was favorable to our guidance of $16.5 billion. ", "Our capital efficiency has improved steadily and was below 15% for the year. With the heavy investment cycles necessary to transform our business largely behind us, we would expect our CapEx to revenue ratio, which is already at a historical low, to continue declining based on disciplined capital spending and improving revenue growth trends. ", "In Wireless, capital spending in the fourth quarter was $1.8 billion, bringing the full year to $9 billion, an increase of 6.3%. The incremental spending in 2011 was a combination of 3G capacity requirements, driven by the Apple iPhone and the continued rapid expansion of our 4G LTE network. ", "In 2012, we will continue to migrate traffic from our 3G EV-DO network to 4G LTE, thereby freeing up 3G capacity and improving our capital and operating efficiencies. ", "In addition, we will continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation and our target is to have 4G LTE coverage similar to our 3G coverage by mid-2013.", "In Wireline, capital spending was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter, bringing the full year to $6.4 billion, a decline of more than $800 million or 12%. The decline in spending was driven by lower FiOS build-out cost, as well as efficiency gains from investing in newer technologies. ", "From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong financial position. Total debt was $55.2 billion and net debt was $41.8 billion. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. As a reminder, the previously announced $10 billion Verizon Wireless cash distribution will occur next week. ", "Let's now move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.", "Our Wireless business had another impressive quarter of growth, particularly with regard to retail customer activity. Total revenue grew to $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, up 13% year-over-year. Retail service revenue, which includes both postpaid and prepaid, grew 7.8% year-over-year, which is a 90-basis point improvement in growth over the third quarter. ", "Total service revenue in the quarter grew 6.4% year-over-year, up from 6.1% growth in the third quarter. Within total service revenues, growth was impacted by year-over-year declines in roaming and wholesale revenue, which collectively amounted to roughly $140 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we expect to see less impact on year-over-year growth rates from these factors as we move through 2012.", "Total data revenue grew to $6.3 billion in the quarter, up 19.2% year-over-year. Data now represents 41.6% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continued to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4 billion in the quarter, up more than 34% year-over-year. Messaging revenue, which makes up about 30% of total data, grew nearly 4% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis. ", "Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 8. We ended the year with industry-leading total connections of 108.7 million, up 6.3% from 2010. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market with 87.4 million connections, driven by demand for our unmatched portfolio of 3G and 4G LTE handsets and Internet data devices. Retail net adds of 1.5 million in the quarter were the highest we've seen in 3 years. Within retail, 1.2 million were postpaid and 252,000 were prepaid. Within the postpaid net add mix, 1 million were smartphones and 400,000 were Internet data devices. The remaining being the net change in basic phones. Of particular interest, more than 700,000 of these net adds were 4G LTE smartphones or data devices.", "In retail prepaid, fourth quarter net add growth was equally distributed between tablets and phones. This quarter marks the first time in 2 years that prepaid phones, excluding tablets, had positive net adds. This is due to the success of our $50 monthly unlimited prepaid phone offer, which we put in place on a national basis in mid-September. ", "Postpaid device sales, which include both gross adds and upgrades, were significantly higher this quarter, driven by the Apple iPhone 4S, as well as the increasing popularity of our 4G LTE smartphones and Internet data devices. Retail postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million in the quarter, an increase of 10% sequentially and 7.6% year-over-year. The percentage of postpaid customers upgrading this quarter moved up to 10%.", "The continued demand for our wireless products is not only driving growth in connections and revenue, but also strengthening our industry-leading customer loyalty metrics. Our churn metrics this quarter were excellent once again, with retail postpaid churn of only 0.94%, an improvement of 7 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2010. ", "Now let's turn to Slide 9 and take a closer look at our smartphones and retail postpaid ARPU metrics.", "As I said, we had a record quarter in terms of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 44%. A year ago, smartphone penetration was 28%. We have made very good progress in 2011. 70% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones, a solid increase from 60% in each of the last 2 quarters. ", "During the quarter, we activated 4.3 million Apple iPhones and sold 1.6 million 4G LTE smartphones. In addition, we sold roughly 700,000 4G LTE Internet data devices. As I said, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. ", "Shifting now to ARPU. Retail postpaid ARPU was $54.80 this quarter, up 2.5% year-over-year. Retail postpaid phone ARPU exceeds $56, up 4% on a year-over-year basis. Postpaid Internet devices have an ARPU of just under $49, which was down 11% from a year ago. This decline was mainly due to a strategic price change we made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We made this pricing move to expand the market, given our expectation that the superior capabilities of 4G LTE will generate more demand and increase data usage on these devices. We did expand the market in 2011 with approximately 3.8 million unit sales, which included mobile hotspots, USB modems and tablets. We now have about 7 million subscribers with these devices, representing about 8% of our retail postpaid base.", "While the unit growth of these devices is diluting our overall retail postpaid ARPU at this time, fourth quarter revenue growth from these devices was 10% on a year-over-year basis. In addition to making a positive contribution to top line growth, the greater efficiency of our 4G LTE network means that this data revenue is also generating higher margins and driving improved profitability. ", "Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10.", "2011 was another strong year of industry leadership in terms of margin performance and cash generation. With the introduction of the Apple iPhone and numerous 4G LTE smartphones during the year, we indicated last January that margins would fluctuate in certain quarters depending on new device rollouts and sales. ", "Looking back on our quarterly margin performance in 2011, shows this to be the case, with strong sales in the first and fourth quarters pressuring EBITDA. As I mentioned, the sales volumes in the fourth quarter exceeded our expectations but, obviously, will create more opportunity for growth in 2012.", "Our strong performance in terms of customer additions and market share gains, coupled with increased smartphone penetration, drove increases in retail service revenues and accelerating phone ARPU. In addition, our intense focus on cost efficiency is clearly helping to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies. Our industry-leading customer retention has also helped the margin and performance, which is a testament to the quality and reliability of our network and to the overall customer experience. ", "Verizon Wireless continues to be the industry leader. And with another year of impressive overall performance, we've built great momentum heading into a new year, expecting to sustain our strong growth and profitability. ", "Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $10.1 billion, a decline of $150 million or 1.5% year-over-year. With the full year Wireline revenue totaled $40.7 billion, down 1.3%. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 1.3% year-over-year, driven by FiOS revenue growth of 18.2%. In Global Enterprise, fourth quarter revenue also grew 1.3%, driven once again by Strategic Services, which increased 14.7% year-over-year. As I've said, Strategic Services, which include Terremark are growing portion of our revenue mix, representing 51% of total enterprise revenue in the fourth quarter.", "From a profitability perspective, the fourth quarter Wireline EBITDA margin recovered nicely from the challenges of the third quarter, increasing 240 basis points sequentially to 23.8%. ", "Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance, starting with mass markets on Slide 12.", "Fourth quarter revenue for mass markets increased 0.7% on a year-over-year basis. Consumer revenue, which represents a majority of this category, grew 1.3% in the quarter. Consumer ARPU steadily increased throughout the year and is now more than $96. I would also highlight that our residential connections trends continue to improve. We lost 183,000 retail residential connections in the fourth quarter, representing the 7.3% decline, compared with the loss of 303,000 or 9% in the fourth quarter of last year. ", "In broadband, we added 201,000 FiOS Internet subscribers in the quarter, increasing our subscriber base to 4.8 million and penetration to 36%. By adding in our 3.9 million high-speed Internet or DSL customers, we ended the quarter with a total of 8.7 million broadband connections, adding a net positive 98,000 broadband connections in the fourth quarter. ", "In FiOS Video, we added 194,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.2 million and increasing our penetration to 32%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 3.5 million customers are triple play and FiOS ARPU increased in the fourth quarter to more than $148 per month. In terms of our deployment, we ended the year with 16.5 million premises passed, adding just over 900,000 in 2011. We had 13.6 million homes open for sale for Internet and 13.3 million for video.", "From my perspective, 2011 was a very good year for FiOS, both operationally and financially. For the full year, FiOS revenue grew 20% to $8.3 billion. Looking ahead, our focus will once again be to increase penetration, drive market and wallet share gains, realize more efficiency from a cost perspective and expand margins. ", "Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise.", "Strategic Services continued to drive the year-over-year improvement in Global Enterprise revenue, led by very strong growth in advanced services such as managed network, call center, IP communications and our cloud offerings. In the fourth quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 14.7% year-over-year, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services outpaced the decline in core Enterprise Services. Terremark revenues were up about 10% sequentially in the fourth quarter and roughly 18% year-over-year.", "Within our Global Enterprise solutions, we are focused on shifting our product mix to higher gross service offerings and we continue to gain traction here. In less strategic areas like core voice, data and hardware, we've continued to look for ways to improve overall margin profitability. One example is our deemphasis on sales of hardware or CPE, particularly drop-ship equipment that is not part of an overall enterprise solutions bundle. ", "During 2011, hardware sales were down roughly $340 million on an annual basis. In the fourth quarter alone, hardware revenue was down $147 million or 21.6% year-over-year. Looking at the services revenue component of Global Enterprises reveals a more positive growth trend. In the fourth quarter, Enterprise Services revenue grew 2.7% year-over-year, excluding Terremark, which was not part of our results a year ago. If Terremark was included, the rate of growth would've been higher but would not represent a true baseline.", "In Global Wholesale, revenues in the fourth quarter declined 7.6% year-over-year due primarily to declines in voice, where we continued to experience secular pressures and lower volumes, offset in part by increases in certain data services. Our deemphasis of certain nonprofitable International Voice routes created downward pressure on revenue, but did contribute to improved wholesale margins. ", "Let's move to Slide 14 for our 2011 wrap up.", "We had a strong finish to a very solid year in 2011, giving us great momentum and confidence heading into the new year. Wireless, FiOS and Enterprise Strategic Services all contributed to significant improvements and adjusted revenue growth, where we moved from just under 2% in 2010 to more than 6% in 2011. These revenue improvements and our focus on capturing operating efficiencies helped us to mitigate various cost pressures throughout the business, creating solid growth in earnings and strong free cash flow, supported by our disciplined approach to capital spending. ", "On the strategic front, we made a number of investments that have improved our competitive position and differentiated us in the marketplace, setting the stage for future growth and improved profitability. I believe investors recognized our progress in 2011, as our stock price appreciation and competitive dividend generated a total return to shareholders of 18.2%.", "We enter 2012 with great confidence in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, you will see a renewed focus on delivering solutions to all of our customers and the markets that we serve by better leveraging our capabilities across all parts of the business. Our Global Enterprise solutions organization is just one example, highlighting a more integrated approach in how we develop and deliver customer solutions, including a vertical industry focus into areas like education and healthcare as examples. ", "Another example is the way in which we are managing our top multinational accounts in collaboration with Vodafone where this makes sense for both companies. In terms of our acquisition of AWS spectrum from SpectrumCo, we are looking forward to closing the transaction after review by the Department of Justice and approval by the FCC, which we anticipate by midyear. We are also making progress in our additional agreements with the cable companies subject to the DOJ's expected review. ", "Just last week, Comcast and Verizon announced that we are offering each other's products and services in Seattle and Portland as our initial markets. We expect to launch in additional cities in the coming months.", "We have great momentum in Wireless and we expect to build on that strength, driving further penetration of smartphones and furthering our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and effectively capture pent-up demand in multidwelling units and new markets. And in the enterprise space, we are clearly gaining traction as the leading global provider in the information technology solution space. The integration of Terremark and the addition of CloudSwitch have significantly improved our competitive position, giving us a unique set of capabilities to combine solutions around the network, data center, security and cloud infrastructure. ", "Another key focus area will be to continue to drive operating efficiencies across and throughout the entire business. With the formation of our operational excellence and process transformation organization, reporting directly to Lowell, we are devoting dedicated resources to examining all costs and processes including product rationalization, back office operations and system consolidation. The upshot of our ability to execute and capture these incremental revenue opportunities and operating efficiencies will be an increase in the cash flows of the business. ", "As I've said, the heavy investment cycles of the first 10 years of Verizon are largely behind us, and we have transformed ourselves into a company very well positioned in the growth markets of the future. We have the platforms, we have the people and we have the capabilities. We are poised to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we've achieved, further increase investment returns and create significant shareholder value in the years to come.", "With that, I will turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "If we could just start with the -- or stay with the 2012 outlook. Last year, Fran, when you gave the 5% to 8% earnings growth, you also suggested that, that could double in 2012. Is that still the right range as we look forward here? And then turning to postpaid ARPU, you had a big quarter in terms of smartphones and Internet devices. Based on what you're seeing now, how do you expect those sort of growth trends on the postpaid ARPU side to progress, maybe in the first quarter and an outlook for 2012, if possible?", "Francis J. Shammo", "First of all, on the 2012 outlook, so let me start here. Actually, John and I are doing this call remotely from our Innovation Center up here in Waltham, which is just a pillar of how we're going to accelerate our growth in the future. As of many of you visited this facility, you saw the innovation of the products and the services, which I believe are pioneer in the industry of developing these types of solutions that will increase our revenue from a machine-to-machine perspective and everything that is going to be driven over our LTE network, which we believe we are a market leader in. So if you take the Wireless asset and then the FiOS asset and you look back at to what we said back in January of 2011, when Lowell and I first stood on this stage live, we stated that we had a year of execution in front of us and we ha certain targets that we wanted to hit. And I think that coming out of this year, I would say that my position has not changed from where I stood on that stage. So growth opportunities for the future, I believe, are there. As I said in my script remarks, I believe that the $2.15, as you look at it for 2012, should be a baseline of $2.20 as you project our growth out. But I would reiterate that my position from January has not changed as I sit here at the end of this year. Going on to postpaid ARPU growth, I think, if you look at this, we continue to grow our ARPU growth. I think that from an overall perspective, if you break that down, we had our phone ARPU grow to an all-time high of 4%. Now if you look back, that was 3.3% in the second quarter. That went up to 3.7% in the third and now sitting at 4% overall. So you can see that the smartphone penetration is accelerating that phone ARPU growth. As we've talked in the past, the Internet category has some dilution in it. So year-over-year, we're down 11% and this is reflected back when we changed our prices back in October perspective. So on an ARPU perspective of Internet devices, down 11%, but overall revenue growth from that category as we said, we did this to expand the category. And again, this quarter, we were up 24% year-over-year in the amount of Internet devices we added and we continue to have our strongest quarter of the year. So we are executing on the expansion of that category. So year-over-year, the actual revenue is up 10%, even though that there is some dilution in the ARPU side. So I think, John, to answer your question, I'm extremely positive and I stay with what I've said coming out of the third quarter. We continue to see that we can accrete our ARPU into the future of 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Maybe a couple of questions just related to Wireline margins. Fran, you talked about continued improvement into 2012, and I'm just wondering if you can help us with the baseline for that comment. Is that meant to be improvement off the 23.8% exit rate? Or is that a sort of general 2012 versus 2011 comment? And then related to that, can you just help us think through what the bigger drivers of improvement would be and if that includes any sort of benefit from the labor negotiations?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So the 23.8% coming out of the fourth quarter, what I would say is, we are very, very confident that through all of the things that we were doing on Wireline. First, start off with FiOS and our continued penetration there and we continue to gain market share in every market. New York continues to be our highest growing market there. So FiOS is a critical component to the growth of the Wireline on a top line basis. The other strategy that we've talked about a little bit in the past is the strategy of migrating our copper plant over to the FiOS plant, now that we have substantial FiOS passing prems, where there is also copper. So what you're going to going to see this year is a very strategic initiative that we go out and we look at areas, where there are chronic copper problems and we start to transform them onto our FiOS network. And the math would say, if there is a chronic problem that we have to visit more than 2x a year, the actual financial benefit of us transforming that to FiOS pays for itself within that year. So we will strategically start to go in there. What that brings is, that brings an enormous expense savings to us from just an overall operational plant perspective. That's one big component. The second is, obviously, with the new organization of Enterprise, we believe that with the acquisitions of Terremark and CloudSwitch, we continue to grow that top line. As I said, Terremark had an outstanding quarter, sequentially up 10%. That came out of a September all-time high booking. That will continue into '12 because, obviously, those bookings don't book all in the same quarter that you sell. In this business, it takes 6 to 12 months to record that revenue. So I think we're continuing to expand on our cloud services bases, which also helps top line revenue for Wireline. And then you get into the cost initiatives, which continue to really be a focus of the whole business unit. So from a foundational standpoint, what I would say is this, on a linear basis, you will see us increase Wireline margin. Will we have some setbacks here and there? Obviously, in the first quarter, we have a lot of tax resets and so forth. So from that perspective, you may see us decline a little bit in the first quarter. But from that point, we will accelerate and continue to overall improve the Wireline margin of the business. Now on the improvement side, I would tell you that we continue, from a labor negotiation standpoint, we continue to negotiate at the table. Obviously, as I said before, we expect that we need to reconfigure the cost structure of our Wireline business. And that gets to the heart of the healthcare and the pension benefits of the Wireline representative and employees. So our position has not changed, we will continue to negotiate in good faith with the union. And we'll report out when those negotiations are ended and where we end for that contractual period.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Fran, that's helpful. If I could just ask for one clarification just on the prior sort of EPS commentary. You said nothing's changed from your January position. I'm just -- the clarification, I guess, would be the interpretation around the January position because the math of it would tell you, 5% to 8% growth and then double that, so 10% to 16% growth. But then the separate interpretation was double the rate of 2011 growth. So are you saying you're comfortable in doubling the rate of 2011 or you're comfortable with the original 10% to 16%?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes. It's more of, I'm comfortable with where we said we would be in January of '11. So my position has not changed.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Very strong results, obviously, from the iPhone, we've seen it across the industry. You talked about a very strong December. How should we think about Q1 versus Q4? Is this a product that's going to continue to have legs into the first quarter of the year? Or do you think the first quarter is going to be a more normal quarter as we'd had in, say, the first 9 months of the year. I'm including this sort of original iPhone launch? So any trends, I know it's early in the year, but anything -- how we should be thinking about Wireless margins in Q1? And then staying on wireless, you noted that there was some pressure on other service revenues from wholesale, roaming, I think that you lost your Telematics customer. Can you just give us a little bit more color about -- around that and what's going to sort of make that better in 2012?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So from a Wireless margin perspective, here, look, I think I'd look at it this way. You talked about one product, I talk about a whole portfolio of products. So if you look at our LTE lineup and just to give you some numbers. We sold almost 15 million Android-based products, and if you do the math for the quarter, it's about 10.8 million iPhone products. So they're both extremely significant to our portfolio. If you look at LTE, we're coming out of the year with almost 18 devices on our network and we will add 6 more in the first quarter of this year, leading us to 24. So I think that the way we look at it is, our momentum coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and, obviously, the first quarter will be more of what we saw in the first 3 quarters because, obviously, the fourth quarter is always a much higher volume quarter just because of seasonality. So I would think that, Simon, on this one, what I would say is this: is we have a proven track record in Wireless that we both drive profitability and growth. And I would expect that in 2012, we will get back to and continue to improve on the Wireless margins. So if you look at what we did in the third quarter, going back, we had an iPhone in our portfolio. We had 3 quarters under our belt with a very real large lineup of 4G LTE devices, and we produced the highest margin in Wireless in the history of the Wireless business at 47.8% margins. So, I guess, what I would say to you is, is that we will strive to continue to improve on the Wireless margins, not only on the top line growth perspective, but we also in the last 2 years trimmed out almost $3 billion of cost in our Wireless business. So again, I think the focus will be to improve and continue to grow, as well improve on the profitability of the Wireless margins. On the wholesale side, there are 2 things happening. Obviously, I reported out that the third quarter, that with the sale of the Alltel properties, we knew that AT&T would be moving that traffic off of our network, which they did. And then in the reseller base, I think it's very important to note that the resellers that we have contracts with are mainly prepaid resellers. And as I've said in the past, as this has declined in the last couple of quarters, we have an issue with us which is, I will only enter into agreements that are win-win for both. And right now, the market is at a point, where I'm not going to compete on the wholesale rates that are in the marketplace. Although this is an extremely important channel for us and we continue to work with our highest resellers, we do have a shift mix in the reseller base. So we added 371,000 net reseller adds, but some of this is a mix change going into lower, what I would call, live source-type offerings and more universal service fund-type offerings, so they carry a lower ARPU than some of our historical prepaid voice resellers would. But overall, the profitability of this is still very substantial. But I also think it's important to note that as we attack the prepaid market, we performed and launched our Unleashed product which, coming out of the third quarter I said, and was very optimistic, that this would be the first quarter that we showed positive net adds in that product space and we actually did. So from a net perspective, we had net adds in prepaid for the first time in, at least in the past 2 years. So we are starting to gain momentum in the prepaid market, both through the reseller channel but also through our unleashed channel. So I think that's what you can continue to see. So that's for the wholesale roaming side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe let's talk about CapEx to start. You talk about better efficiency in the slide deck. So with the revenue rising, should we think about that as being sort of flat? And then also on the cash outlay side, can you talk about cash taxes in 2012? Do you expect that to be sort of in line with the GAAP taxes or maybe a little higher as bonus depreciation starts to slip away?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So from a CapEx perspective, coming out of the first half of this year, I stated that we would have very strong management of our capital expense as we continued to build out the EV-DO network and the capacity required to carry the iPhone on the 3G network from a capacity standpoint. And I think you've seen that Verizon Wireless has managed this extremely efficiently by moving higher end Internet devices off of the 3G network onto our 4G network. And just one other note is, in the fourth quarter, all of our Internet devices sold, 100% of those adds, were all on the 4G LTE network. So I think from a CapEx standpoint, what I would say is, I would not expect any change here from a disciplined capital spending coming out of the back end of 2011 going into '12. And as I said, we will continue to improve our overall CapEx-to-revenue ratio. So I wouldn't expect you to see anything differently than what we've executed on through 2011. As far as cash outlay, from a cash tax perspective, as you know, the bonus depreciation is Safe Harbor for 2012. So there really is no additional cash tax from the bonus depreciation and, obviously, there's still a lot of things that we're looking at for 2012 from a bonus depreciation discussion down in Washington, of an extension of that, possible overall corporate tax restructure. So we look at those things. But I will tell you, that even without that, we continue on a very complex organization of taxes for federal purposes, continue to strategize and continue to think of how we best utilize our structure to make sure that we have as minimal cash outlay as possible from a cash tax perspective. The only thing I will highlight from a cash differentiation for 2012 is the pension plan contribution, as I talked about. This will go from $400 million up to $1.26 million for '12, and those contributions will be made more or less smoothly through the year, but the first and the third quarter will be around $400 million and then evenly in the second and fourth quarters. So that really is the only change from what I would expect from a cash outlay. The only other thing I would say is, as our profits continue to increase and we grow bottom line, obviously, our cash taxes will increase with them.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Timothy Horan of Oppenheimer.", "Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I'm just trying to understand, Fran, your comments on LTE. Maybe what you're thinking on market share and on the pricing for LTE. It's clearly expanded the market, but maybe when do you think you'll have the ability to go out and raise prices for LTE. And I'm not sure if you gave the numbers, but what percentage of LTE subscribers are new to Verizon and maybe how does that compare with the iPhone? And lastly, it just seems like LTE is just a huge advantage this year. Do consumers really understand it? Is the advantage really going to be pressed with all the new devices that you have coming out? And just how you're thinking about LTE versus your competition for this year, which it seems, it was the year you'd be able to capture a lot of the high-end subscribers off your peers?", "Francis J. Shammo", "I think that just from an overall market perspective, obviously, we believe that we are, without a doubt, the market leader in this innovation pioneering of the technology of LTE. We have now over 200 million POPs covered, which exceeded what our original plans were to achieve 185 million POPs. And as I said, we initially told that we would have 3G and 4G coverage about the same by the end of 2013, and we have now said by mid-2013, we'll have that coverage fulfilled. So, I think, from just an overall leadership position and a market position, I think we're in great shape. From a pricing perspective, obviously, we did the fourth quarter promotion, where we said we doubled your allowance coming, so that we would have more enticement of people looking at the 4G product. And as you can see, we had our all-time high of 4G devices moved, of over 2.4 million devices in the quarter moved, from that strategy. So I think overall pricing what I would say is this, I think you'll see more movement on device pricing than you will on overall service pricing. We'll have to see what the competitive marketplace holds for this. But I think that from just an overall perspective, LTE will be a market leadership for us. And it's not only around just the retail market, but we can't lose sight of the machine-to-machine market. And obviously, I said, I was sitting up here in the innovation lab, there is a lot of technology and innovation that's going to come out around an automobile, around healthcare, around energy conservation that really will leap bound anything that we see currently in the marketplace today. So I think that from a machine-to-machine perspective, we continue to see growth in our adds quarter-over-quarter, and I see that continuing through 2012 and have a market leadership position there.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "First, could we just get an update on Verizon Wireless debt and cash at the end of the quarter? And then secondly, could we just get a deeper dive on what's happening in the improvement in Global Enterprise revenue? What are the products that you find are really helping the Strategic Service revenue growth? And then, are you also seeing less headwinds on -- those downward pressures on the legacy side of Enterprise?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So from a Verizon Wireless perspective, they're going to end the year at $12.3 billion worth of cash on the balance sheet. They have $11.6 billion of debt, so they're actually in a surplus position of $700 million. For 2012, they have about $1.6 billion of maturities coming that will be paid down. And as I said, within the next week, we will have a $10 billion distribution to both of the parents there. So that's the situation of the cash and the debt on the Wireless side. From an enterprise perspective, I think that it's critical here, just overall, with this organizational structure that Lowell has set up with the Enterprise Solutions Group. It is key for us because, I said before, as we approached our enterprise customers, we still had a delineation between a wireless solution and a wireline solution. And now that the organizations come together with the product rationalization that I talked about, it's going to be critical for us to present one solution to our customer end-to-end. And that really, I think, will elevate where we are today just from an overall strategic services position. But to get to your question, Mike, about exactly what are we selling. Obviously, cloud services, the acquisition of Terremark, the addition of CloudSwitch, the opening of the NAP center in Amsterdam, the expansion of our S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil data center which quite honestly, up to the acquisition of Terremark, Verizon really never played or had a position in Latin America, so this is a very high growth area for us. So I think, one, absolutely around the cloud, but also the convergence of cloud and what that brings to -- from an overall enterprise mobility standpoint and the integration of that cloud and that mobility solution when you look at machine-to-machine and cloud and what that can bring to an enterprise customer in a vertical solution set. So I think you're going to see more and more around cloud, but machine-to-machine. And then obviously, around our IT and advanced communication offerings. But there also is a differentiation as to what we sell here in North America versus what we sell outside of North America. And as I said before, outside on international, again, this quarter we grew our international enterprise base by an excess of 9%. So even with all of the pressures you see around the world, we continue to grow. Now, obviously, that's because of our low market share in those markets, but continued growth for us. And as we expand internationally, I think you'll see more international growth out of us, especially around the cloud services. And as I said, the collaboration of Vodafone where it makes sense. So I think there's a couple of different facets there, but I am very -- I have a very good outlook for our Enterprise revenue growth going into '12, even with the continued stabilization of the economy and we have not forecasted much growth there but stabilization would be a key. And if there is growth there, then I think we are even more optimistic on our Enterprise growth.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered but just on FiOS, nice growth there. I know you said it's going to be a large part of the revenue contribution in Wireline next year, or this year rather. Can you just comment on the pricing you're seeing there and the competitive environment specifically with the cable players?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes. I think this is extremely important because as I've said before, I know folks are saying that we're overly competitive in pricing. But what I would say is, that the pricing has not actually changed and if anything, if you look at it, there was a price increase in 2011. And there will probably be some more price increases in 2012 as we go here. But I think the differentiation we have here is, we have a superior product in FiOS. It is taking hold in the marketplace. We are seeing, as I said, New York is our highest growing market. This past year, we crossed a milestone in Virginia. We passed 40% penetration on our video services. You can see we had a good quarter on broadband connection in FiOS. And I think if you look at the line loss that we set at 7.2%, you can see that, that strategy of the chronic, we started that in the fourth quarter of this year a little bit. You can see that we are starting to convert copper voice customers onto FiOS. So continuing to grow and hold on to that declining revenue stream of the legacy products. So I think, overall, FiOS will continue to play a very important strategic role in the future of Wireline. We will compete vigorously with this, even with the agreements that we entered into with the cable companies. If you look at the innovation agreement, that innovation will come into FiOS. And being a superior product already, that innovation will add what we can bring to the consumer base from an overall perspective. So I think, overall, I'm very optimistic on our FiOS penetration for 2012.", "Operator", "Your last question will come from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two, if I could. Just first, Fran, going back to the Wireless pricing equation. You guys have had, I think, a comfort level with your products' status relative to others, pricing it at a premium. We saw a price hike a year ago from Sprint. We saw an overall kind of refresh of pricing from AT&T recently. You have talked about the introduction of new family plan prices. If you could kind of elaborate a little bit on how the pricing lever can be used to kind of grow ARPU in 2012, that would be helpful. And then second, the Wireline revenue side would probably have grown in aggregate, if it weren't really for the kind of other segment, which kind of fell off in 4Q. Could you kind of elaborate a little bit on, on what's going on there and what the outlook for that is in '12?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So, David, just to follow up, you're talking on the wholesale side of Wireline?", "David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sorry, on the -- there's consumer, small business equals mass markets, then Strategic Services and other, which was 1.94 down from 1.99 in 3Q.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Okay. All right. Very good. Thanks. So from an overall Wireless pricing equation, I think that we are the market leader. We set our tier pricing structure when we launched our 4G network. And as I've said, the way we positioned our 4G tier pricing was that based on our future view of where usage would go, we saw that we had opportunity from a tiered structure and the proliferation of video through the LTE network that we would grow our revenue streams. And that's what we're seeing just from an overall tiered pricing structure. As we continue to mature this, we have said that we are looking at family data plans, if you will, and we continue to look at that. And obviously, the play there is, is to make sure that it's a win-win for the customer and a win-win for us from an accretion standpoint. So we continue to work that. But I think that it's important to note that we are a premium-priced product, but we will win in the marketplace just like we did with Unleashed even though that, that's priced $10 above the market. We now see that there are niches of people that want to be on the best network in the world. So I think that will continue to be our strategy, and we'll see here as 2012 goes. As far as Wireline goes on that, I think wholesale, we continue to see pressure on the wholesale side of the business just from a legacy voice. And as we transform this business from a legacy voice business to a data business, continue with our fiber to the cell program, which we are building out for various wireless carriers. This continues to be very good business for us, but not quite enough to offset the voice loss. So I think we'll continue to see pressure in there going into 2012. As far as the other category, this is legacy MCI 108 traffic, call collect-type traffic, which will continue to decline. It's not something that's strategic for us and we'll just really move that as a cash cow at this point, and that will continue to decline. So overall, the focus here is on the consumer Wireline margin, the Enterprise portfolio and then also the wholesale portfolio.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I'm John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay, you can do so from our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also on our website.", "I'd like to state that all quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Also, there were no special items of nonoperational nature included in our reported results for the first quarter, of either this year or last.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our first quarter results. On our last earnings call in January, I talked about the confidence we have in our ability to benefit from the market opportunities we see in our key strategic growth areas. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. With the results of our first quarter, we continue to execute and deliver on the guidance we gave back in January of 2011 and reaffirmed earlier this year. We remain as confident in the direction of our business now as we were then, and we continue to deliver strong results.", "Earnings per share were $0.59, up 15.7% over first quarter last year. In Wireless, we saw a sharp acceleration of growth in retail service revenue and postpaid ARPU, driven by increased smartphone penetration and higher data device adoption, resulting in increased usage. This top line growth, combined with effective cost management, resulted in a very strong service EBITDA margin. Consumer retail revenue growth also continues to improve, driven by another solid quarter of FiOS performance. Our broadband net adds were the highest we have seen in nearly 3 years.", "We had an extremely strong quarter of cash generation. Free cash flow of $2.4 billion is more than 3.5x the amount generated a year ago. The first quarter is normally the lowest quarter of the year, so we expect to see increasing free cash flow levels going forward. Capital expenditures in the first quarter were down more than 18% as our disciplined approach is resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.", "Let's begin our review with a look at consolidated results on Slide 4. Our consolidated results show strong growth this quarter. On the top line, our growth trends continue to be very positive, coming from all strategic areas, most notably, Wireless services. This quarter, overall revenue growth far outweighed the increase in operating expenses, resulting in double-digit operating income growth of 16.7%. Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.2 billion, and our margin expanded to 32.7%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and 210 basis points sequentially.", "Let's turn now to cash flow and capital spending on Slide 5. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $1.7 billion, driven by reduced levels of capital spending and an 18% increase in cash from operations. Capital expenditures totaled $3.6 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $800 million compared to last year. Our overall capital efficiency continued to show steady improvement. We expect our annual CapEx-to-revenue ratio to decline for the full year based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.", "In Wireless, capital spending in the quarter was $1.9 billion, which was lower by $850 million or 31% from the first quarter last year. You will recall that at this time last year, we were spending more to meet 3G capacity requirements in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. As we move through the year, you will see a continued focus on migrating traffic from 3G to 4G LTE, which will drive additional improvements in our capital and operating efficiency. We will also continue to expand our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation.", "In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion this quarter, about 5% higher than the first quarter last year. This increase is due to timing, strategic spending in enterprise and some copper-to-fiber migration within our residential customer base.", "Our balance sheet remains very strong. You will recall that the $10 billion cash distribution from Verizon Wireless was paid this quarter. We used our proportionate share and part to pay down commercial paper and to redeem a maturing bond. As a result, total debt declined by $3.6 billion since the end of last year. Our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.3x at the end of the quarter.", "Let's now move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless business had an impressive quarter and a strong start to the year, posting accelerated growth in service revenue and our highest retail postpaid ARPU accretion in 3 years. Total Wireless revenues of $18.3 billion grew 8.2% and now represent about 65% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. Retail service revenue growth accelerated to 8.9%, 110 basis point increase in growth from the fourth quarter and the highest growth rate we've seen since early 2009. We are seeing strong revenue growth from multiple postpaid sources: Smartphones, tablets and Internet devices. And retail prepaid revenue grew strongly again this quarter, up 17.3%.", "Total service revenue grew 7.7% this quarter, 130 basis points higher than the growth rate in the fourth quarter. Total data revenue of $6.6 billion grew 21.1%. Data now represents nearly 43% of total service revenue. Data revenue growth continues to be driven by web and email services, which increased to $4.3 billion in the quarter, up nearly 36%.", "Let's take a closer look at our connections growth on Slide 7. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market, driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and Internet devices. With the unmatched service quality of the nation's largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry-leading $93 million retail connections, 88 million postpaid and 5 million prepaid. During the quarter, we added 734,000 new retail net connections, 501,000 postpaid and 233,000 prepaid.", "Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I'd point out that within the prepaid net adds, 138,000 were tablets. About 60% of the prepaid tablets this quarter were 4G LTE. Within the retail postpaid category, gross additions were just over 3 million, down about 12% from a year ago. We believe this decline is both seasonal and a function of the timing of the new device launches last year. Our porting ratios with all carriers are favorable, and our postpaid churn metrics remain excellent. Although the first to report, we are confident that our 501,000 postpaid net adds is a strong result.", "Postpaid device sales, both gross adds and upgrades, totaled about 10 million this quarter with 8% of our postpaid base upgrading devices. In addition to smartphones, we are also having great success in the Internet device category, which includes tablets. This quarter, we sold 765,000 4G LTE Internet devices, which is more than last quarter. We are the market leader in this space as mobile hotspots or Jetpacks, USB modems and tablets represent 8% of our retail postpaid connections. I would also point out that 62% of our active tablet base is postpaid.", "Next, let's turn to Slide 8 and take a look at our smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales, increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 47%. 72% of all retail postpaid phones sold this quarter were smartphones. We sold 3.2 million Apple iPhones and sold 2.1 million 4G LTE smartphones this quarter. We sold 500,000 or 30% more 4G LTE smartphones this quarter than we did in the fourth quarter.", "Consistent with prior quarters, about 20% of our smartphone sales are gross adds or new to Verizon, and the rest are upgrades from our existing customer base. Within these upgrades, 42% are customers buying a smartphone for the first time, representing incremental recurring data revenue. This is a significant point of differentiation and a strength for us.", "Retail postpaid ARPU was $55.43 this quarter, up 3.6%. This is a big acceleration in accretion over what we experienced in 2011. Growth in retail postpaid phone ARPU accelerated to 4.9% this quarter and now exceeds $57.", "Postpaid Internet device ARPU was about $48 this quarter, a decline of 8.7% from last year but an improvement from an 11% year-over-year decline last quarter. Although postpaid ARPU for Internet devices is less than for phones, we are seeing double-digit year-over-year revenue growth driven by increased unit sales. We already have a majority share in this important category, and we continue to expand the market for devices, which enable higher usage. We also expect more network efficiency as an increasing percentage of data traffic moves to our 4G LTE network.", "Let's turn to Slide 9, as I'd like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE, which is now available in 230 markets and more than 200 million POPs, covering over 2/3 of the country. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nationwide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We are seeing increasing customer awareness of the capabilities of 4G LTE and a growing recognition of the superior performance of smartphones, tablets and Internet devices on the Verizon 4G LTE network. Third-party comparisons of our 4G LTE network performance compared with others generally ranks us highest in terms of consistency of access, performance and speed, with better average download speeds and significantly higher average upload speed.", "In addition to our network deployment and coverage advantage, sales of 4G LTE products are clearly gaining momentum. In the first quarter, we sold 2.9 million postpaid smartphones and Internet devices, a 22% increase over the fourth quarter. The vast majority of devices we have for sale are 4G LTE. We now have a total of 8 million 4G LTE customer connections, representing 9% of our postpaid base. Of note, about 2/3 of these are smartphones. We remain very pleased by our 4G LTE progress. The Verizon 4G LTE network has become the destination of choice for consumer and enterprise customers, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward.", "Let's conclude our Wireless segment review with a discussion about profitability on Slide 10. In the first quarter, we generated $7.1 billion of EBITDA, which is an increase of 14.2%, and expanded our service EBITDA margin by 410 basis points sequentially to 46.3%. Our margin performance is once again a testament to our ability to execute very well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of accelerating service revenue and ARPU growth, and intense focus on cost controls and consistently excellent churn metrics are contributing to our industry-leading margin performance.", "Going forward, we will continue to look at opportunities to mitigate the cost of higher equipment subsidies and commissions. We have identified $2 billion of cost saving opportunities for this year, and we are on track to capture these savings. We also announced the $30 upgrade fee, which will go into effect next week.", "Let's move to our Wireline segment next on Slide 11. Total Wireline revenue declined $202 million or 2% in the first quarter. About 60% of this decline is a result of targeted product rationalization actions we have taken to improve the quality of our revenue mix. Within wholesale, I'm referring to our continued exit from unprofitable international wholesale routes and contracts. In Enterprise, it is our deemphasis on selling of drop ship hardware or CPE. And the other revenue line item, the majority of the 82 million decline this quarter was from nonstrategic products, which include the former MCI mass markets business, long-distance, local wholesale and calling cards, public pay phones and directory assistance. We are exiting the calling card and public payphone businesses entirely.", "While the Wireline revenue decline was accentuated by these targeted actions this quarter, growth in the strategic areas continues to mitigate the more secular and cyclical declines in other parts of the business. As we have stated, we are taking a hard look at all of our product lines and rationalizing those that are not meeting our strategic and financial requirements. For example, going forward, we will no longer be selling high-speed Internet or DSL over copper in areas where FiOS is available.", "From a profitability perspective, first quarter EBITDA declined by $148 million year-over-year with 100 basis point decline in the EBITDA margin to 22.6%. The decline is due to several factors, revenue declines in less-strategic products and first quarter cost pressures like higher OPEB accruals, increased active benefit cost and escalators in certain content contracts. We have targeted price actions planned to help offset certain cost increases, which will contribute to our overall profitability goals this year. I remain confident that we will achieve EBITDA margin improvement for the full year, and we continue to be very focused on improving the long-term profitability of the Wireline business.", "Let's take a closer look at our revenue performance starting with mass markets on Slide 12. As a result of the scale of FiOS and increased penetration, consumer ARPU has continued to steadily increase and is now over $97, up 8%. In addition, our residential connections trends continued to improve. We lost 205,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.8% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 289,000 or 8.6% at this time last year. In the first quarter, we delivered strong broadband growth, gaining a total of 104,000 net subscribers. With a 193,000 FiOS Internet additions, we passed the 5 million FiOS subscriber mark and increased our penetration to 36.4%.", "More than half our FiOS customers already use 20 megabit speed or higher. And with more devices like tablets, game consoles and smart TVs connecting to the Internet at home, demand for higher broadband speeds is on the rise. Later this year, we plan to introduce a series of higher speed packages that will further differentiate FiOS as the nation's fastest Internet service and allow us to continue to monetize our investment in the FiOS platform.", "In FiOS Video, we added 180,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.4 million and increasing our penetration to 32.3%. Within our FiOS subscriber base, about 68% are triple-play, and our FiOS ARPU now stands that more than $148 per month. Our focus continues to be on increasing FiOS penetration, realizing additional operating and capital efficiencies and expanding margins.", "Let's move next to our business markets, starting with Global Enterprise. Strategic Services continue to drive the overall positive growth in Global Enterprise revenue. We continue to post double-digit growth in application services like managed network, data center, security, cloud and IT infrastructure. Within the IP layer, private IP and Ethernet services are contributing to the growth.", "In the first quarter, these services totaled $2 billion, up 11.6%, representing just over half of Global Enterprise revenue. As we've seen for the last several quarters, the growth in Strategic Services did outpace the decline in core Enterprise Services but not to the same degree.", "As you might expect, we are experiencing some short-term revenue pressure from Europe and foreign-currency. In addition, our deemphasis on sale of hardware was worth about $43 million on a year-over-year basis. Growth in services revenue was 2.3%. Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall Wireline revenue growth and profitability.", "Our strategic repositioning of Verizon Enterprise Solutions has better aligned our strength in high-growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. Our acquisitions of best-in-class assets like Cybertrust, Terremark and CloudSwitch, combined with our industry-leading 4G LTE and global IP networks, gives us a unique platform of assets to provide comprehensive, integrated solutions to enterprise organizations.", "In Global Wholesale, revenues in the first quarter declined $181 million or 8.9% due primarily to declines in voice and local services. As I said, we continue to take targeted actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts, to improve the quality of our revenue mix during this period of secular decline and lower volumes. Partly offsetting these declines were continued growth in certain data services, most notably, fiber-based Ethernet.", "Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, we had a solid start to the year, and we remain confident in our ability to take advantage of the market opportunities we see and our key strategic growth areas. We are on track with our plans, and we expect to continue to deliver strong results going forward. Our focus will continue to be on execution, striving to capture incremental revenue and driving operating efficiencies throughout the business. Our success in stimulating top line growth and capturing cost savings will enable us to mitigate certain secular declines and cost pressures.", "In terms of recent news, yesterday, we announced plans to conduct an open sale process for all of our 700 megahertz A and B Spectrum licenses in order to rationalize our Spectrum holdings. We acquired these licenses as part of the FCC auction 73 in 2008. The sale of this license is contingent upon the close of the purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless. These transactions are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice and are expected to close by mid-summer.", "In closing, I'd reemphasize that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the investments we've made, further improving investment returns and creating significant shareholder value in the years to come.", "With that, I will now turn the call back to John so we can get to your questions.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Fran. Brad, let's open it up for questions, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Fran, a couple of questions. First on the Wireless ARPU, very healthy uptick in the retail postpaid growth rate. Can you help us think through prospects for further improvement in the rate of growth from here? And then second question just on Wireline margins, I think the reset in the first quarter was a bit larger than most of us had initially expected sort of going into the process. You talked about confidence in improvement from here. Just wondering how should we think about the pacing of this through the year? Would you expect it to be fairly linear and show up in the second quarter results or is this more back-end loaded, maybe contingent on a union contract?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So let's start. These are 2 actually big questions, and that probably will result in larger answers than you would expect. But on Wireless ARPU, let's start out with the fact that I think as we started out in 2011, we said that we had a path to accelerate the growth of our revenue. We came out of the fourth quarter, I reiterated my confidence on that projection. And as I sit here today and I will continue to reiterate that we are confident that we will continue to accelerate our growth in this category. And it's going to come from many, many different areas. So you have to keep in mind, number one, our smartphone penetration is at 47%, which means that there are 53% of our phone customers that are still on a basic phone. So we still have a lot of roadway here from a basic to smart upgrade. And as you know, 42% of our customers this quarter went from a basic phone into a smartphone category, so that is accelerating the growth. In addition, as you heard on the script, our Internet device category is starting to stabilize a bit, and we expect that to continue to go throughout the quarter on an ARPU basis. As last year, we reset prices, we expanded the category, so the growth of that category is expanding for us, but we knew we had some short-term ARPU pressure by the price resets that we launched into the marketplace. But that set us up for our 4G LTE launches. And as you saw, we had a stellar performance on a number of devices that we moved on our 4G network this quarter. So that's a couple of things. I probably could go into a lot more detail around our data sharing plans, our commercial launch of Fusion and if we want to get to more discussion on that, we can. But we are very, very confident that we are on a path to continue to accelerate the growth of our ARPU. On Wireline margins, just a couple of things here, too, to talk to. So number one, we did have the FiOS-to-copper migration, which impacted our short-term results but we've talked that this is a strategy that we're deploying. It is better for us long-term to get most of these customers off of our copper network to our FiOS network. As you saw that we are -- stopped selling our naked DSL in FiOS covered area and we started to convert a number of customers in this quarter over to our FiOS network from a voice perspective. Now a couple of things here that this will launch, number one, we will see a long-term benefit in our repairs and maintenance decrease over time. We will also get the upsell capability to start selling these voice customers on better speeds of FiOS and better experience. And also then into the linear TV product that we have to offer. And what we're seeing is the minimum number that we converted last year during our trials, we're starting to see a 30% sale upgrade on those customers, but it does take us 3 to 6 months to convince those customers to upgrade. So this is a longer-term type strategy. In addition, going into the future, you're going to see, you may have already saw, that we are starting to do some price-ups in strategic areas. We've also started that in April but over the next 2 quarters, we're going to have several priced-ups in our FiOS packages. In addition, we're going to rebundle certain of our packages to better bundle our content in order to make it more profitable based on the Tier that you picked for us. The other thing is that there's other revenue streams coming from down the pipe like home monitoring control that will contribute to the overall ARPU of our FiOS platform. We also have a very disciplined cost structure in place. As you see that, we declined our SG&A expense year-over-year. In April, we also had another ISP [ph] to our represented employees, which we had a number of people take. So we've already taken off 1,100 people from payroll since the quarter has closed. We are taking other measures around the consolidation of our back office operations, as I've talked to in the past. You see that we are exiting some of our unprofitable or low-margin businesses, which will help us in the future. And then, of course, the union contract and we can talk more about that. But obviously, the business needs a cost restructure and that's what that is about. So I'll stop there, I'm sure we'll have some more questions here.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Fran, is there any way you could quantify the copper-to-fiber sort of incremental cost in the quarter?", "Francis J. Shammo", "At this point, we're not going to disclose that. It did result in some incremental capital for prepositioning and then it did the result in some expense for us. But actually for this quarter, it was not a big component of the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS.", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "First, just 2 quick ones. First, on, I guess a follow-up on the Wireless side. You saw 260 basis points of annual margin improvement in the first quarter. And now talking about accelerating ARPU growth and like you said, the $30 that gets started gets tagged onto upgrades in May. I mean, is that a decent number or, I guess, why shouldn't we expect that kind of year-over-year increase in margins or maybe even better as the $30 starts to flow-through? And then, second of all, maybe on use of cash, could you remind us what your target leverage ratio is. We're at the, I guess, 1.3 now given that debt pay down. As we look out to next year and we're modeling another dividend, obviously you don't want to chat and you don't want to sort of look that far out, but I'm just trying to get a sense for the use of cash as we go forward?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Okay, so, on the Wireless margin expansion. I guess there's a couple of things here that are important. Number one is, as you know, we have been on a 2-year track here to reduce expenses in our Wireless unit. And over the last 2 years, we've taken out about $3 billion of expense. This year, we have another target of $2 billion. So I know that everyone is focused in on the subsidy model, but as I've said, that's just one line item in our P&L, and it takes managing the entire business to be an efficient business. And I think that Wireless has done a really excellent job on reduction of cost and creating more efficiency within the model. And that's what's driving the margins, beside the ARPU increases that you see in the revenue growth. And as we stated last year coming into this year, that our goal was to get back to our third quarter level of last year's margin and then continue to grow from there, and we're putting in all those actions to do that. As far as the $30 upgrade fee, I'll remind everyone that we started back in 2010 on a strategy to start to take out some of the lucrative promotions we had around upgrades by deleting the New Every Two program, limiting the amount of early upgrades that we allowed. And now the implementation of the $30 upgrade fee, which we were the last carrier to implement. But it's important, too, for the overall profitability of the business, and the experience that we expect to have within this business. So I think there's a number of actions that Wireless is taking to continue to focus on the ARPU expansion and then the margin expansion because we like to do both at Verizon, we grow and we expand our margins. And then as far as the use of cash here, on a targeted net debt-to-EBITDA. It's more important that I think we're comfortable with our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio. This will improve over time as we continue to delever in certain areas where we think it's reasonable to do. You saw us take the proceeds of the Wireless dividend this quarter to pay down some debt that was maturing that was high-interest debt that, quite honestly, didn't make sense at this time to refinance in any perspective. So we will continue to manage our cash. Important, our dividend policy is extremely important to us, and Lowell and I have said very strongly that we will continue to the policy of our dividend. So I'll stop there, and we'll go on to the next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "You talked about the Wireline margins and I think there was a question about the union contract. Could you give us an update on where you stand and the ability -- if it's just been moved forward and get progress, some agreement over the coming quarters? And then on Wireless adds, you had I'm sure the best in the industry, but overall, we expect the industry to be flat to down on postpaid. Do you sense this is just a lull post the iPhone 4S launch last quarter? Did to see a sort of a pickup sequentially through the quarter, any thoughts about how the rest of the quarters pan out in terms of Wireless versus Q1?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So first let's talk about the union contract. So look, I think it's safe to say that as we entered into this new negotiation, we knew that this is going to be an extremely difficult negotiation. We have said very strongly that we need cost structure within the Wireline business. Obviously, if you look at the profitability of this business over the last 5 years, it has decreased. And this cost structure is not palatable going forward. So we need to some concessions, we need health care contributions. We need some pension revisions. And look, were not asking for things that have not already been given to other companies. These are not new issues. They've already been given to some of our peer companies. So we are standing strong. We need this cost restructure in order to build on the profitability of our Wireline unit. The other thing is, look, we've invested over $24 billion into this unit on the FiOS platform. And in order for us to be competitive with our competitors of cable who don't have these very lucrative benefits and average salaries of $90,000 with an incremental $50,000 of healthcare and pension on top of that, we need some cost restructure here. So look, this is a hard negotiation. It took one of our peer companies over 500 days to get to where they were, 3 years ago in some of these breakthrough issues. So we continue to negotiate. We continue to put proposals on and we'll see where we go, but we knew this was going to be a long haul. And with my comment of improvement of Wireline margins, it's all built in those comments. On the Wireless adds, I think we're extremely pleased with the growth of our Wireless business on an add basis. If you look at, though there's going to be other categories that drive the growth of Wireless in the future, as I said, we will be launching our data share plan in mid-summer this year. We believe that, that plan, the way we have it designed, will enable our customers to easily connect other devices to that plan. And I think that as we do more connections, you notice that we did not disclose total connections. As I've said that machine-to-machine is becoming a more complicated device and connection of the way the plans are built, so it's not important anymore of total connections. It's more important of our revenue increase based on the customers that we're growing. I think that if you look at our Fusion product that we just launched in certain states, our trials are going very well. The customers' experience is extremely strong. We had a target of 10 million homes that we're going to launch to in May, of this year, when we commercially launch. And that we'll build to, as we build out the 4G LTE footprint to a target of 34 million homes. We believe that's a growth engine for us in the future. Then we have tablets, we have prepaid. This is the second quarter in a row where we've grown our prepaid base with our Unleashed product. And in the next week or so, you're going to see us add in a smartphone to our prepaid product on an $80 price point with 1 gigabit of data. So there's a number of actions that we're taking. If you think about the third ecosystem and then also the cable partnership that we also just launched some new markets with Time Warner cable this past quarter, Kansas, Ohio and Carolinas. So we've continue to expand. I think we have a growth rate test to increase adds on a full year basis here, and we're on that track.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMC.", "Philip Cusick - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So 2 questions, we'll see how I do. So first on the prepaid, tablets were up little bit, and I wonder if you saw a little bit of a drag even though from the timing of the iPad launch and if things have got a little better since things -- since that's come through? And then second, we've been getting a lot of questions about your ability to control iPhone subsidies. And maybe you can help us out a little bit. It seems like the way you control costs, some [indiscernible] raising upgrade rates, some sort of pushing back on timing rather than cutting down on the actual subsidy of that device, is there a level of control you have on those subsidies over time or are you pretty much stuck with the way things are priced today?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So first on prepaid tablets. It's a great point. We did see a slowdown in the beginning of the quarter on the anticipation of the iPad 4G LTE device coming to market. And as you know, that was only about 2, 2.5 weeks of product in the marketplace. And we saw significant volume previous to any volume that we had previously seen on tablet sales. So I think that going to the second quarter, that volume will continue. So yes, there was a little bit of a downward demand in the beginning, waiting for the new iPad to come out. So again, I think we're off to a good start. We sold 390,000 tablets in the quarter. And as we said, bulk of them were -- 60% were increase in tablet sales year-over-year. So I think going into the future, tablets will continue to be a very strategic segment of our business. On the Apple iPhone, look, I think as I've said before, we look at every individual handset, we have a broad portfolio. We manage it by handset-by-handset and manage our subsidy and again, that's just one aspect of our P&L. And this is just a nature of this business that's grown from the beginning of the industry that we subsidize handsets. I do think though it is important that there is a third ecosystem that's brought into the mix here. And we are fully supportive of that with Microsoft, and as we said that we created the Android platform from beginning. And it is an incredible platform today that we helped to create. And we're looking to do the same thing with a third ecosystem. So that's how I think that we plan to go into the future here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Real quick. Could we just get an update on the net debt at the Wireless level? And then taking a step back, could we get an update on what's happening in enterprise with the VDMS strategy that you're trying to rollout and then anything else in terms of demand that you're seeing on video and how that's helping your enterprise business?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So on the net debt for wireless, we have gross debt of $10.9 billion, cash on hand of $4.4 billion, so net debt is $6.4 billion. On the enterprise, VDMS, think we're making great progress with the new organization and the umbrella organization that John Stratton has over both Wireless and Wireline from an enterprise perspective. We have gone very deep into verticals. We see that there is, and if you paid attention to Lowell's remarks here recently at the healthcare forum, we see a lot of healthcare opportunity and are engaging in a lot of partnerships to extend what we think is a really good product set on the reduction of overall healthcare costs in the nation, but also to deliver some really neat innovation-type ideas into the future of healthcare and how we manage that from an enterprise perspective. As far as overall growth of the segment, we did see a decline this quarter in Europe. It was not expected. Just to give you some baseline here, last year, our European market was growing on average about 13%. It contributes about $450 million of revenue per quarter. We saw that drop to flat this quarter. So there was a drastic pullback in our European market. We don't believe that, that is long-term. We think that that's more of a short-term issue. We already started to see some increased bookings here exiting the first quarter, but that probably won't turn into revenue for 3 to 6 months. As you know, this industry is a longer-term type recording from the time that you get an order. But I think this is a short-term issue for us, but it did put an impact on our overall growth. Now having said that, our cloud services and our strategic nature of our security are those portfolios are growing well. Our overall cloud portfolio grew by 17% quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. So I think we're making progress in the area that we want to make progress in, but again, the portfolio rationalization is also creating a drag here. And as we continue down that path, we will lose some revenue in those less-profitable platforms that we really want to discontinue investing in, but it's for the betterment of us and betterment of our customers to move them to a more highly innovative platform. And then the last thing, of course, is the development and launch that we did last June of our VDMS platform, and we will be launching our next phase of that come this June, and we expect to see some growth revenue acceleration from that platform as we go here. So there's a number of things that John is implementing that I think will contribute. As I said in my script here, the -- contribute of the future growth of the overall Wireline, revenue top line and margin growth.", "Michael Rollins - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And Fran, if I could follow up one more thing, what pushed Verizon Wireless over the edge to put the Spectrum up for sale? Can you just address a little bit of the background to yesterday's announcement?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, so thanks for that question and I think this is an example where people write articles where they don't have facts. So let's talk about the facts. So number one, I think Verizon Wireless has shown over time that they are very, very good stewards of Spectrum and efficient Spectrum. And we are responsible and efficient owners of the Spectrum. And as a company policy, we will not hoard the Spectrum. Now when we bought this back in 2008, obviously, we did not have the foresight to know that we would have an opportunity to acquire AWS Spectrum from the cable company. And if you look at our Spectrum holdings, we purchased the 700 megahertz, which is an extremely efficient and this is where we built our LTE platform on. And then we had the AWS spectrum in the East, which was very efficient from an overbuild perspective on capacity of our LTE platform. And now with the deal that we have with SpectrumCo, we believe that is the most efficient for us to utilize and build out our LTE platform. So hence, the lower 700 megahertz A and B does not fit as nicely into our Spectrum holdings as it may for others. But we think it's the prudent thing to do, to sell these licenses off to the rest of the industry for the benefit of their customers and to enhance their ability to build out 4G LTE. So I think we would say that we're being good stewards. This has nothing to do -- we did not just wake up yesterday and decide we were going to sell Spectrum because we ran into a roadblock at the FCC. That is continuing. We have facts that say the 180-day clock is going and that we are still very confident that we will get approval for the AWS acquisition from SpectrumCo. But just the 2 other points I want to make here is, number one, this is contingent on us getting the a getting the AWS Spectrum approved because, obviously, we would need this spectrum if that's not approved and again, we think it's the right thing for the FCC and maybe a standard for them to use in the future of how Spectrum should be allocated out and sold and efficient ownership and protocols. The other thing is I think there were some articles written that this is going to be a fire sale. This is nothing near a fire sale. We bought this Spectrum back in 2008. We've had carrying costs, and we will be prudent to our shareholders to make sure we get the return our investments. We know what the value of this Spectrum is in the free market, and obviously, we're going to an auction to allow many different parties to participate through a third-party auctioneer. And look, if we don't get the price that we think is a fair price, then we won't go through with the sale, and that's at our discretion. So I think there's some important facts and I'll stop there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "David W. Barden - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just maybe a couple of follow-ups. Just first, Fran, on the AWS Spectrum approvals, is there a level of divestitures that the FCC could come up with that will be a deal breaker from your perspective or is just getting kind of any magnitude of an AWS deal done sufficient? And then with respect to the Wireless margin, you're targeting $2 billion of cost cuts, I guess, for the year. If you could kind of share with us where we wound up after the end of first quarter on that? And then the last one, if I could, is just, could you kind of give us an update on what, if any, results have you been able to generate from your partnership with the cable companies on the selling of a joint product that have been material to the business?", "Francis J. Shammo", "So first on the AWS approval, I think that we're exactly where we expected to be. The conversations are going exactly the way we thought. I'm not going to speculate on caps or what we would do, what we wouldn't do and I think what I'll say is, look, we're exactly where we thought we would be and I think we'll close this transaction by mid-summer. On the $2 billion Wireless cost cutting ideas, I think we've shown that we are very good executioners on the cost-cutting routines of $3 billion in the last 2 years. The $2 billion is a combination of a variety of things. You saw the announcement of some call center rationalization. Obviously, part of this $2 billion is to work on the reduction of our subsidies, and you saw -- you're already seeing some of these plans go into action with our upgrade feesand some other things. So there's a wide wrath of cost-cutting initiatives that Dan, me and his team are executing on. And right now coming out of the first quarter, we're actually right on track where we expected to be. And then lastly, on the cable companies, obviously, we're still in a trial mode. We're working out the kinks. We launched a couple markets here with Comcast up in Seattle and Portland. We just launched a couple of new markets with Time Warner cable. So I think it's too early to talk about this one. The agreements are still in front of the DOJ and the FCC and we continue to cooperate with them. And we'll wait till the transaction closes and get up full to speed and then we'll talk about that.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.", "Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Fran, 2 questions, if you don't mind. On the enterprise business, on the core business, could you just give us maybe a little color around -- it sounds like you're seeing volumes are fine and you haven't really seen a pickup in competition. But obviously, these peripheral legacy products are in decline. I just want to make sure that's kind of what you're saying. And maybe, did you see any seasonality in core enterprise that you see maybe lower sales in December and that's kind of picked up. I know you kind of talked about Europe a little bit, but maybe just here in the U.S.? And then I just have a CapEx follow-up.", "Francis J. Shammo", "As far as enterprise goes, look, I think the enterprise business is in our Strategic Services area. It's steady as she goes. We're growing that portfolio. And look, any time ago through a massive restructure like John has implemented at VES with going into more of a vertical-type segment, you're going to have a little disruption within your frontline sales force and I think we saw that. But that was like a 60- to 90-day interruption and I think we're getting back on pace and we expect enterprise to start to get back on their feet here going into the second quarter and through the year. And as far as the core side goes, the core is just steady as she goes. It's a declining business. People are moving away from the legacy voice and long distance and moving more into the IP technology. And this is where we have several of our customer [indiscernible] still on the legacy core platforms that we need to move off of so that we can stop investing in those platforms and get them to something that is more innovative and more efficient for them as a company as well. And I don't think they're surprised with the conversations that we're having. So I think as we go here, this will be a steady course. And as we said before, our goal is to be a gross national product-type growth here, GDP plus type organization. So I think that's we're striving for and that's what's John is striving for as well.", "Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "So just on enterprises, sounds like you're really trying to accelerate the conversion over. How much longer do you think that would take?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Well, I think this is going to be some of these legacy-type platforms. This could be a 2-year transition.", "Timothy K. Horan - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then CapEx, is flattish a good number for the full year versus last year? I know even with a decline it was a percentage of revenue at a fairly healthy pace given what we're seeing in Wireless.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, I've said that the guidance would be -- we wouldn't give specific guidance but flat is a good guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities.", "Michael McCormack - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Fran, could you just make a comment on the ARPU side? Obviously, pretty strong performance on the wireless ARPU. But it looked like voice, the headwind on voice sort of became less of a headwind this quarter. Pretty good improvement on the rate of decline. Is what you're seeing there, whether it's people just not pricing that down anymore or what behaviors the consumers are showing you? And then just a couple on the housecleaning side, on Wireless D&A, looks like it was down sequentially. I was just wondering if there was a change in assumption there? And then on the Wireline margin commentary, the better year-over-year I'm assuming that's on a reported basis.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, so Mike, just a couple of things here on the voice and text messaging. Our messaging revenue actually grew 4% again year-over-year. So we're not seeing what others in the international market have seen. And again, it all comes down to the way you package the bundle and we still have a majority of our customers taking a bundled package of voice and text along with their data plan. So we're starting to see that -- that starting to flatten out perspective. But look, I mean, we keep our eye on this, and with 4G LTE and VoLTE coming at the end of this year into next year, there will be additional opportunities to convert more revenue from our voice products as we launch into more, if you will, IP-type videoconferencing and so forth. As far as Verizon Wireless depreciation and amortization, look, at the beginning of every year, we have a policy that we look at our asset base and reevaluate all of our estimated lives on all of our asset bases. And sometimes make decisions to accelerate and sometimes we make decisions to reevaluate the lives that we have in a certain asset. And we've done that this year as we do every year, and in Verizon Wireless, there was a life extension on our entire EV-DO platform. But this is nothing unusual that we normally don't do. And so that's the answer to that one.", "Operator", "Your last question will come from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just to come back to the CapEx statement. In order for your CapEx to be flattish over the course of the year, it would seem like the spending would have to pick up a little bit in Wireless. First of all, is that the correct conclusion? And if so, what would be behind that? And then the second question is to clarify a statement you made about margins. Fran, you mentioned sort of getting to the third quarter of last year Wireless EBITDA margin, that was just inside 48%. Is that a point you think you can achieve once again at some quarter during the year or is that actually a full year target for Verizon Wireless?", "Francis J. Shammo", "I mean, as far as -- these are both guidance-type questions so I'm not going to get into the specifics of them. So look, we said we'll be flat at CapEx and let's leave it at that. I'm not going to get to the individual components or quarter-by-quarter. And then on the Wireless margins, I've said that, look, our goal is to get back to our 3Q margin and we'll strive to get there.", "John N.

This represents about $0.02 in earnings per share. other than that, there is nothing unusual in terms of other income, interest or income taxes.", "I'd also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "with that, I'll turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute well across the entire business. Solid top line performance combined with a strong focus on profitability, and cost management has resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the last two quarters.", "This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.", "Through the first half of the year, we generated $7.8 billion of free cash flow, which is more than twice the amount we generated in the first half of 2011. The Wireless business is firing on all cylinders and our strategic actions and results clearly demonstrate our position of leadership in the industry. We continue to post strong growth in retail service revenue, driven by increased smartphone penetration, Internet device adoption and new customer additions.", "In the second quarter, this top line growth combined with effective cost management and excellent customer retention resulted in a record setting EBITDA service margin of 49%, which surpassed our previous high of 47.8% in the third quarter of last year.", "In Wireline, consumer revenues were up 2.5%, which was the highest growth rate we've seen in several years. While we continue to face challenges in the enterprise and wholesale markets, we are confident that the decisions we\u2019re making and the actions we are taking are the right ones for the long-term.", "We're intensely focused on profitability management and key actions related to this include product portfolio rationalization, targeted pricing moves and cost management initiatives. I will go through these in more detail during our segment review. In time, these actions will result improved wireline profitability. in spite of some revenue softness this quarter, we were able to increase the EBITDA margin by 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% and our objective is to have a stronger EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012. Overall, our strong second quarter and first half putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year.", "Let\u2019s begin our review with a look at consolidated results on slide four. We sustain solid consolidated growth trends in the quarter, with contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue grew to $28.6 billion, up 3.7%. Our focus on expense control helped drive double-digit operating income growth of 15.5%.", "To put this in perspective, while consolidated revenue increased $310 million sequentially, operating income is up over $450 million. This clearly demonstrates that our product rationalization, cost management, and process improvement efforts are starting to payoff. We continue to be very focused on improving profitability, moving more of every dollar we generate to the bottom line.", "Consolidated EBITDA grew to $9.8 billion and our margin expanded to 34.2%, up 150 basis points on both the year-over-year and sequential basis. The upshot is an improved earnings growth trajectory for this year. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, we posted better than 12% EPS growth in the second quarter and we are up 15% year-to-date, which is at the upper end of the guidance we provided in January of last year.", "Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow and capital spending on slide five. Our free cash flow this quarter increased $3 billion sequentially to $5.4 billion driven by a 56% increase in cash from operations and reduced levels of capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, a decrease of about $690 million compared to last year.", "For the first half, capital spending of $7.4 billion was down more than 16% year-to-date. Our outlook for the full-year is flat to down versus $16.2 billion in 2011. We continue to expect our annual CapEx to revenue ratio to decline, based on improving revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.", "In Wireless, CapEx in the second quarter was $2 billion, which was 23% lower than last year. Through the first half, Wireless capital was $3.9 billion, was down 27% year-over-year. You will recall that in the first half of last year, we were spending more for 3G capacity in connection with our initial launch of the iPhone. Going forward, we expect to see continued migration of traffic from 3G to our lower cost 4G LTE platform, which will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency.", "We will also continue expanding our 4G LTE network coverage, which is already the largest in the nation by a wide margin. In Wireline, we spent $1.6 billion in capital during the second quarter, 5.3% less than last year. Through the first half, Wireline capital was essentially flat with last year at $3.1 billion.", "Our balance sheet and credit metrics remained very strong. Total debt of $52.4 billion is down $2.8 billion since the end of last year. Net debt was $42.4 billion at the end of June and our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2 times.", "Let\u2019s now move into our review of the segments starting with Wireless on slide six. Our Wireless business had another very impressive quarter sustaining strong growth in retail service revenue, higher retail postpaid ARPU growth and excelling cost and churn management resulting in our highest EBITDA service margin ever.", "Total Wireless revenues of $18.6 billion grew 7.4% and now represents 65% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue year-to-date. Our revenue results were driven by 8.6% growth in retail service revenue. Postpaid revenue, which makes up most of retail service, grew 8.3%. Retail prepaid revenue was also very strong, up 27.2%, the highest growth we\u2019ve seen in four years. Total service revenue grew 7.3% this quarter and is up 7.5%, year-to-date. Data which represents almost 44% of service revenue grew 18.5% to $6.9 billion in the quarter. Retail postpaid data revenue grew more than 20%.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at connection growth on slide seven. We continue to gain share in the retail postpaid market driven by sustained demand for our 3G and 4G LTE handsets, tablets and internet devices, with the unmatched service quality of the nations largest and most reliable wireless network. We have an industry leading 94.2 million retail connection, with nearly 89 million postpaid and more than 5.3 million prepaid.", "During the quarter, we added 1.2 million new retail net connection; 888,000 postpaid and 290,000 prepaid. Before we discuss postpaid in more detail, I\u2019d highlight another strong quarter of retail prepaid performance with a 24% sequential increase and net adds. Similarly last quarter, tablets represented a little more than half of the add, however this quarter 95% of our prepaid tablet additions were 4G LTE, which is key from the standpoint of better operating and capital efficiency.", "In postpaid, our 888,000 net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 501,000 in the first quarter. Our porting ratios with the major carriers continue to be strong and our churn metrics remain excellent. Retail postpaid churn of 0.84% is the lowest we\u2019ve seen in four years.", "Postpaid growth additions in the quarter were just over $3.1 million, up about 3% sequentially. As expected, upgrades were lower sequentially with about 7% of our postpaid base upgrading devices in the quarter. In addition to increasing smartphone penetration, we also continue to make good progress with internet devices, which include postpaid tablets.", "In the second quarter about 90% of the internet device sales were 4G LTE. We are far and away the market leader in this space with more than 7.5 million internet device connections in our retail postpaid base.", "Next, let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at smartphone and retail postpaid ARPU metrics. We had another strong quarter of smartphone sales increasing the penetration of our retail postpaid phone base to 50%. Once again an increasing majority of retail postpaid phone sales were smartphone, 73% compared with 60% a year ago.", "During the second quarter, we activated 2.9 million Android smartphones, 2.5 million of which were 4G LTE and 2.7 million Apple iPhone, up from 2.3 million a year ago. During the second quarter 25% of iPhone sales were gross adds or new to Verizon, with 75% representing upgrades from existing customers. In terms of 4G phone sales 20% were new to Verizon and 80% upgrades. Importantly, more than 40% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time.", "Retail postpaid ARPU was $56.13 this quarter, up 3.7%, which was higher than the previous record growth of 3.6% last quarter. In terms of the mix, retail postpaid phone ARPU of about $58, grew 4.9% while internet device ARPU of about $47, declined 6.6%. As expected, Internet device ARPU has become less dilutive to blended post data ARPU and growth.", "In addition, these devices continue to generate double-digit service revenue growth. Our 4G LTE deployment has expanded the market for these devices. All of which enables higher usage of our network.", "Our Share Everything plans, which became available on June 28 represent a new and innovative pricing framework, providing a unique customer value proposition and at the same time creating an optimal way for us to monetize increasing data usage. These strategic thrust of these plans is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage. Our plans are designed to make the decision to upgrade to a smartphone or add a tablet much easier.", "By allowing up to 10 devices to share data, these plans also provide for the creation and adoption of all kinds of new connected devices. Early feedback has been great and our customer adoption is tracking with our expectations. We are seeing a wide variety of customers and family share accounts opting into Share Everything, including existing smartphone customers with unlimited data plans.", "Let\u2019s turn to slide 9, as I\u2019d like to spend a few more minutes talking about the strength of our 4G LTE leadership. We are by far the market leader in 4G LTE coverage, which is now available in 337 markets covering more than 230 million tops, which is nearly 75% of the U.S. population. And point of fact, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors networks combined. Throughout the year, we will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with the goal of having a nation wide footprint similar to our 3G network by mid-2013. We continue to be very pleased with 4G LTE adoption.", "Customer awareness of our 4G LTE network superiority is increasing. And our new brand advertising further positions us as the network of choice for 4G LTE. Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily, each and every quarter since we launched service about a year and half ago.", "During the second quarter, 4G LTE smartphone sales increased more than 16% sequentially to 2.5 million units, nearly a 11 million or 12% of our 89 million retail postpaid connections are 4G LTE. Roughly 70% are smartphones, and 30% are Internet devices.", "Stated in other way, about 19% of our smartphone base has a 4G LTE handset, and more than 43% of our Internet device connections are 4G LTE. While these statistics are impressive in their own way, they also show we have lots of room to grow, which is a very positive indicator for us looking forward.", "Let\u2019s conclude our Wireless segment review with the discussion about profitability on slide 10.", "We generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, which is an increase of 15.8% and expanded our EBITDA service margins by 270 basis points sequentially to 49%, again a record high for us.", "Our margin performance is once again a testament to our sustained ability to execute well on our strategy of balancing growth and profitability. The combination of sustained service revenue and ARPU growth, an intense focus on cost management, lower upgrade eligibility, and consistently excellent in churn metrics are contributing to our industry leading margin performance.", "We will continue to look at all opportunities within our cost structure to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies. As I previously indicated, we have identified $2 billion in cost savings opportunities in wireless, and we remain right on track to successfully capture these savings.", "On the transaction front, our purchase of the AWS licenses from SpectrumCo, Cox and Leap Wireless are at varying stages of review by the FCC and the Department of Justice. We continue to expect approval and to close these transactions this summer. Our plans for an open sale process for our 700 megahertz A and B spectrum licenses are proceeding as planned, but of course remain contingent upon the closing of the AWS purchases I just mentioned.", "The agreement that we announced in late June with T-Mobile to exchange specific spectrum in the AWS band is also contingent upon the closing of those transactions. These license transfers also require FCC approval, which is expected later this summer. These transactions are good for all parties and the industry as a whole, as we facilitate the best first use of this spectrum for all players. We appreciate the constructive role the FCC has played in this process, and look forward to securing approval.", "Let\u2019s move to our wireline segment next on slide 11. Second quarter wireline revenues were flat sequentially, but declined 3.1% year-over-year. From a profitability perspective, wireline EBITDA declined 6% year-over-year, but improved about 2% on a sequential basis, with EBITDA margin moving up 50 basis points sequentially to 23.1% despite lower quarterly revenue.", "Wireline revenue is affected by a number of underlying factors. On the upside, revenue growth is accelerating in the consumer market, driven by FiOS, which again at 2.5% was the highest growth we\u2019ve seen in several years.", "Enterprise and wholesale revenue continues to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe as well as by related foreign exchange movements.", "In addition, as we indicated last quarter, we are also making deliberate and specific moves to rationalize and simplify our Enterprise Solutions product portfolio, eliminating products where they no longer make sense, reducing product complexity, streamlining services, and consolidating networks to improve efficiency and product profitability.", "We currently have more than 700 different products and thousands of variations that are defined by particular geography, network or system. This portfolio simplification effort will dramatically improve our go-to-market speed and operations quality. In the near-term, these actions create revenue impacts. Over time however, the actions will result in margin benefits and improved profitability.", "We estimate that about 65% of the overall wireline revenue decline this quarter was a result of our own deliberate actions to improve profitability. Examples include the de-emphasis of drop-ship CPE, the continued exit from certain international wholesale routes and contracts, decommissioning end of life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN, no longer offering dry-loop DSL or selling DSL in FiOS markets, and exiting non-strategic product lines by calling cards and payphones.", "Again, we firmly believe that these are the right actions to be taking at this time. We are on the right track, and I\u2019m confident that these product rationalization and process simplification initiatives, along with additional cost management actions will improve the long-term profitability of the wireline business.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at revenue results starting with mass markets on slide 12. Within mass markets, consumer revenue growth of 2.5% improved from 1.7% and 1.3% in each of the last two quarters. As a result, our pricing actions related to set-top box rentals, triple play bundles, and higher data speeds available through our new FiOS Quantum offer. The outlook for accelerating consumer revenue growth in the next several quarters looks very encouraging.", "Our residential connections trends also continue to improve. We lost 199,000 retail residential connections in the quarter, representing a 6.6% decline year-over-year, compared with a loss of $240,000 or 8.2% at this time last year.", "FiOS revenue grew 17.4% in the quarter and now represents 65% of consumer revenue. As a result of the increasing scale of FiOS, total consumer ARPU is now over $100, up 8.5% from a year ago. FiOS ARPU now stands at more than $149 per month and 70% of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play, with voice, Internet and video services.", "In terms of broadband, we added 134,000 new FiOS Internet additions and now have more than 5.1 million subscribers, representing a penetration of 36.6%. We had a net loss of 132,000 DSL subscribers, which is higher than the last few quarters primarily due to seasonality. We believe that the discontinuance of dry loop DSL, also negatively impacted net add, but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint.", "In FiOS Video, we added 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.5 million and increasing our penetration to 32.6%. We continue to seek ways to drive FiOS revenue growth, improve operating and capital efficiencies and maximize profitability. Key parts of the strategy include targeted pricing actions, further differentiating our services with the offers like FiOS Quantum.", "Our copper to fiber migration in areas with chronic repair issues within FiOS markets, and a number of other cost management initiatives. In light of these actions, we feel a more natural range for FiOS quarterly net adds going forward should be about 20,000 to 30,000 less than our previous range of 180,000 to 200,000. We are confident that at these levels, we can still maintain an increasing revenue growth trajectory and expand profitability.", "Let\u2019s move next to our business markets starting with global enterprise. Global Enterprise revenue was down $32 million sequentially or less than 1%, but declined $136 million or 3.4% year-over-year. In addition to a $70 million impact from lower CPE sales in the quarter, foreign currency translation had an $84 million adverse impact on growth as the stronger dollar versus the euro, and pound sterling caused the decline in the current quarter compared with the benefit a year ago. Absent these effects, we would have had positive revenue growth in spite of the continued secular and global economic challenges.", "Strategic services, which comprises 52% of global enterprise revenue totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%. While we continue to perform well in these services, international and FX are having an adverse effect on growth at this time.", "Looking ahead, we do expect our enterprise business to contribute more to the overall wireline revenue growth and profitability, particularly as we work through our product streamlining and process efficiency initiatives.", "Our strategic realignment of Verizon Enterprise Solutions will better position us to unlock value in the core business, while better aligning our strength in high growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine, and advanced communications. We remain confident in the strength of the enterprise asset portfolio and the value it will generate over the long term.", "On the acquisition front, our purchase of Hughes Telematics has passed the Hart-Scott-Rodino stage, and we expect to complete the transaction in third quarter. We look forward to combining Hughes Telematics\u2019 robust service delivery platform and suite of applications with our global IP network, cloud, mobility, and security solutions. We believe that this platform has the potential to reach beyond automotive and transportation and create new M2M opportunities in mobile health, asset tracking, and home automation to name a few.", "Moving next to global wholesale, revenues in the second quarter declined $34 million or 2% sequentially and $203 million or 10% year-over-year due primarily to declines in transport services. We continue to take all the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s.", "Let\u2019s move now to our summary slide. Overall, a strong second quarter and first half putting us solidly on track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We continue to execute very well. Our solid top line performance in the first half of the year has been fueled by strong retail service revenues in wireless and increasing growth in consumer wireline.", "Our record-high wireless margins in the second quarter combined with our strong focus on improving profitability through product rationalization and cost management in the wireline has driven double-digit growth and consolidated operating income, and earnings per share for the last two quarters.", "This strong operating performance together with our disciplined capital spending drove significant increases in free cash flow and an improving return on investment profile for the entire business. We expect to continue to build on this momentum and look forward to a strong second half of the year.", "With that, I will now turn the call back to John, so we can get to your questions.", "John N. Doherty", "", "Thanks, Brian. Before we jump into questions, I know that we are having some link issues with the IR website this morning. we are working on it, and all the typical documents will be available shortly if they are not already.", "With that Brad, let's take our first question, please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great, thanks. Good morning, Fran. A couple of questions, first on the FiOS metrics you just talked about, sort of a new range for additions that I guess implies more or like 160,000 to 180,000 adds per quarter going forward. You flipped a little bit lower than that this quarter, I am just \u2013 can you help us think through that. You obviously talked about some price hikes, are we also at a point where the base is large enough that 2Q seasonality in video i.e., were negative, and then rebounced in 3Q, is this starting to catch up with the business as well.", "And then second question, just on the wireless distribution. it was roughly this time last year you announced intentions for a $10 million upstream payment to the JV partners. Can you help us think through maybe a timeline for announcing the distribution for next year and then given the stronger free cash flow you\u2019ve seen in the business, would that point sort of conceptually to a bigger distribution? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yeah. sure, Jason, thanks for the question. So first on the FiOS piece. just a couple of things here, so yes, there was \u2013 we actually did have slower growth in this quarter than we anticipated. so a couple of factors here, one was there was a seasonable unusually high move season in the month of June compared to prior second quarter. so we experienced some additional moves out and normally in this business, it takes us a quarter to recapture the move in. So I think that partially would set off from a timing difference. But more importantly, I think that we have refocused more on our profit, on the FiOS side.", "So first we went through these price ups, you saw some of the benefits there in the first quarter, where we drove our consumer revenue growth, the 2.5%. And this was the price ups of our set-top boxes and you\u2019re going to see more price ups coming in the third quarter around the bundles and into the fourth quarter.", "In addition, we launched our Quantum product and the price ups that we have on people choosing additional speeds. I am extremely confident with both of these actions. We can double our revenue growth by the end of this year from 2.5% to around 5%, and I am very confident that we can accomplish that.", "So, one is that that we\u2019re really concentrating on revenue growth. Second is, as you know we\u2019ve really concentrated around copper to FiOS migration. We nearly doubled the amount of migrations we did in the second quarter versus the first quarter and also what we\u2019re seeing is, the first quarter migrations that we accomplished, these customers are generating more ARPU, close migrations and free, because they are also selecting higher speeds under our Quantum offers.", "So I think the range as we said is probably in the neighborhood of 150,000 to 170,000. I know you said, 160,000 to 180,000 but it\u2019s around 150 to 170. But we are on a steady growth pattern, and I believe that we are really focusing in on better margins and acceleration of the top line.", "On the Verizon wireless dividend, I know there has been a lot of press lately out there and I am not sure where this idea is coming from, but I can tell you, right now the only thing I will say is that, there is not distribution on the agenda for the upcoming Verizon wireless board and that\u2019s probably I am going to say at this point in time.", "Jason Armstrong \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, thanks Fran.", "John N. Doherty", "", "Brad, can we move on to the next question please.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may ask your question.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Thanks, guys. Two quick ones for you on the Wireline side; first, Fran, thanks for all the info on the product rationalization on the wholesale side. But you could give us some idea of when you think you should start to see some improvement, I think the 10% was a little bit worse than we thought, when do you think that could start to get better? And then, second of all, if you could update us on the union contract and where you are in negotiations that would be great.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Okay, great. Thanks, John. So on the wholesale side, yeah, 10% decline, this was accelerated from 8.9% in the first quarter. And to be honest, I think that we're fighting an uphill battle here on the core voice in LTE product, and that will continue to decline. The focus right now is to reposition ourselves for Ethernet and fiber-to-cell, and those products are picking up. And I think that quite honestly the range that you see here is probably the range that we will continue with somewhere between an 8% to 10% decline going forward. But again, this is a diminishing revenue stream and we will continue to manage that stream.", "On the union side of that half, as I've mentioned before, when we entered into these negotiations, we knew that this was going to be extremely difficult and very hard negotiations, and it was going to be a long-haul not a short-haul. And given our peers, it took them 500 days to get the contributions and some pension resets, and we're now almost the year-end of this, sort of 365 days.", "So, when you look at the profitability of this business over the last five years, it has decreased and this cost structure is not sustainable going forward. We really needed the business to address this cost structure in relation to the benefits, particularly healthcare contributions and pensions, and we need increased flexibility around our work rules, which we \u2013 some of these work rules date back to 1960. So we aren't asking for things that have not already been given to other companies, these are not new issues for the union, a many of our peer companies are already there. So we are standing strong on our position of cost restructure in this business, so the negotiations are continuing albeit slow and the process will take as long as it takes for us. So at this point, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll report on the union negotiation.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Great. Thanks, Fran.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, John. Brad, can we move to the next one please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you very much. Good morning. Following up on the pension situation, have you had a chance to run the numbers on the new highway bill and the new discount rates and any impact that you may have on your near-term pension contributions? And related to that, you\u2019ve talked about strong cash flow generation this quarter, your leverages in the low ones, how are you thinking about target leverage here, about dividend increases for Verizon Corporation and potential buybacks down the road? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "", "Thanks, Simon. So on the pension plan, we have looked to build preliminarily, but there \u2013 this is a very complex thing. I will tell you that at the beginning of this year, we said we would have to contribute $1.3 billion into the plan. We have $400 million left to contribute for the remaining piece of this year. But I think there\u2019s other things that have to go into consideration here other than just the timings benefit of this bill.", "First, you have to look at the borrowing rates. Second, you have to look at tax rates structures, then what the current rate is versus what future rates may be. And then you have to look at the overall pension strategy that we have related to our pension plan. So at this point, I\u2019m not prepared to speak to whether we will adopt the funding plan or not adopt it, what I will tell you is, this is not material to the cash flow either this year or into the next three years, and again, it is just the timing issue. So I will have more to report on that as we complete our analysis and come into the 2013.", "As far as cash flow goes, we had an unbelievable quarter in cash flow from operation generation, our continued focus in on investment and making the right investments to return additional investments on that and get greater returns both in the wireline and the wireless business. As I said, we really have curtailed the spending on our EV-DO networks, which is generating more cash flow in the wireless business. But again, without really going into a lot of detail here, the dividend policy is extremely important, it is a board decision, but it is very, very important to Low and I, and we will continue to recommend to the board what we think is appropriate. And from a share buyback, as I said before, I don\u2019t think we are in a position to start buying back shares, it is always a timing issue for companies to \u2013 when the best time to do that is and at this point, we probably won\u2019t be in a position to do anything like that until late \u201913 or early \u201914.", "Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Simon. Brad, let\u2019s move on.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Philip Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Philip Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "Hi, guys. Thanks Brad. You mentioned that some customers have been moving over to the new price plans, I wonder if you can give us some idea of whether we should be looking for some ARPU headwind in the third quarter versus the rapid rate that you\u2019ve been growing before it starts to sort of be accretive maybe in next year? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yeah, thanks Phil. I mean, it is very preliminary, we just launched this on June 28, so we just started in on this. I think some of the positive factors that we are seeing, is that obviously all of your adopters are always your optimizers, but to be honest based on where we are at right now, we are actually tracking ahead of where we thought we would be and we don\u2019t see any ARPU impact in the third quarter or fourth quarter. I think our trend will continue that we have established here in the first and second quarter. And the benefit though that we do see is that we are seeing some 3G unlimited customers move into our 4G share data plan product and that is excellent for us from a cash flow position on capital efficiency and cost reduction metrics. So there are some interesting things there, and then that again the other thing on ARPU here is, as Internet device ARPU continues to improve that gives us better opportunity to accelerate our overall ARPU growth.", "Philip Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.", "That\u2019s all. Thanks Fran.", "John N. Doherty", "", "Thanks, Bill. Can we take the next question, please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse your line is open.", "Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities", "", "Thanks. Fran, I\u2019m wondering if you can give us some context of where you think, sort of longer-term over the next three or four years, CapEx to revenue trends in wireless?", "Francis J. Shammo", "", "Well, I think that without giving a lot of guidance here, beyond this year which we set our overall capital plan will be flat to down from where we were last year. Obviously, you can see that wireless is utilizing capital extremely efficiently, down, I think now or most for the year about $1.3 billion year-over-year. Our overall CapEx to revenue ratio in the first half of 2011 was 16.4%, and that\u2019s down to 13.1%, and as I said before, we are committed to continue to improve on that metric this year and continuing to \u201913 and \u201914. And I think we will leave it at that.", "", "Jonathan Chaplin \u2013 Credit Suisse Securities", "Thanks.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Jonathan. Brad, let's take the next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Michael I. Rollins \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets", "", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just a quick side note, if you can just give us an update on the wireless net debt at the end of the quarter. And then secondly, if you can go in a little bit more depth on what's happening in the enterprise business, maybe you could help us size Europe or international for you, versus U.S. and give us a sense of what strategic services, would be growing at, if you can have the European issues, this CPE influence side, et cetera. Thanks.", "", "Francis J. Shammo", "", "Sure, Michael thanks. So for the end of this quarter gross debt on wireless box is a $10.9 billion. On July 1, we actually paid down another piece of that debt of $800 million. The cash rate now is $8.4 billion so net debt at the end of this quarter was $2.4 billion.", "On the Enterprise business just a kind of set some of this \u2013 as I said last quarter, our international revenue is about $400 million a quarter. We were growing close to 15% to 17% on a year-over-year basis, both within EMEA and in Asia. Last quarter, we said that we saw the first time that it actually went flat on year-over-year basis, and this quarter we actually saw a decline on a year-over-year basis. Strategic services is about 75% of our sales in international, which is very different than it is here in the United States.", "So with the FX impact and the impact that Europe is having on that strategic revenue stream that is having an overall impact on the overall strategic revenue growth. I think the important thing here is the way we move forward, is that we are really building our business around platforms. And if you look at what we\u2019ve done, we are rated number one in the world on security. We have build our data center platform around our Terremark acquisition and now we are going to build our machine-to-machine and applications platform around the Hughes Telematics. And I think that brings a different paradigm to us going forward.", "So I\u2019m very optimistic on the Enterprise business. We are showing still some growth in strategic services and I think if we didn\u2019t have the headwinds and some of these other economic pressures, I believe we are a double-digit strategic growth company there should be no reason why we can\u2019t get back to those numbers that we showed in the past two years.", "So I think this is a temporary thing, but given where we are with Europe this could be another two to three quarters out, mid \u201913 before we start to turn the corner here. But we are positioning ourselves and I think we are making all the right decisions that when we do turn the corner and get some economic release that we will show a very good portfolio here.", "Michael Raynes \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Thank you.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks Mike. Brad, let\u2019s move on to next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from David Barden of Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.", "David W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Fran, just a quick housekeeping item. I think this quarter you said that Wireline margins in the second half would be higher than the first half. Is that the same thing as what you said last quarter that Wireline margins would be up year-over-year, just to clarify?", "And then, the upgrade rate fell from 8% in 1Q to 7% in 2Q and obviously that\u2019s a big swing factor for margins, almost 200 basis points. Have you think for the rest of the year and maybe as a run rate as a function of the actions that you\u2019ve taken for upgrades, how do you think about that 7% upgrade rate as a baseline as a driver of margins through the rest of the year, and maybe just generally going forward? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Sure. Thanks, David. So on the Wireline margins, look, we are very, very solid on improving our Wireline margin here in the second half, first the first half. I think that given some of the cost structure issues that we have, especially around the contract, we think that we can still improve our margins. If we can get to a better [inhere] with the contract, then I think that we can actually improve our margins on a year-over-year basis, but that will come down to a timing issue.", "I do think, though, that when we\u2019re focusing on the consumer side of the house, as I said, I\u2019m very confident that we can double our revenue growth here. We are very focused in on the profitability of FiOS. The profitability increase in Wireline this quarter was really centered around the FiOS, really progress that we made on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So I think we have a lot of good things here, and we\u2019ll just have to play this out, but we\u2019re very, very confident that we\u2019ll improve our wireline margins here.", "On the upgrade side of the house, obviously this is timing a lot of things go into play here. We\u2019ve made a lot of moves in the last year and a half around restructuring our upgrade policies. As you know, we\u2019ve launched our $30 upgrade fee. Obviously, this all has an impact on the level of upgrades and then of course, there is always that Rumour Mill out there with a new phone coming out in the fourth quarter. And so people maybe waiting, but look, we manage this on a quarter-to-quarter basis.", "I think, the way I look at this though going into the back half of this year on the upgrades is that, we\u2019ll manage this business on a profit and on a growth trajectory. And if you think about what wireless has done when we get to the fourth quarter. We will have taken $5 billion out of our cost structure in the last three years, which is why we can generate margins of 49%, which beat our all-time high from last year. So I think that wireless has a very good track record in history to deliver both on profitability and growth.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, David. Brad, we will move on.", "David W. Barden \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Fran.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura Securities. Your line is open.", "Michael McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities", "Hey, guys, thanks. If I maybe just a little bit deeper dive on that thought process, and we obviously with some new policies in place and relatively lower upgrades. We might not see the same pattern, we saw last year and last year, we all remember that people were waiting for the iPhone in Q4, so Q3 margins were super high. Should we not expect that same dynamic given the changes in policies? And then secondly, on the FiOS side, when you talk about profitability, is this on a per subscriber basis or just slowing down overall growth adds, and should \u2013 we will not be making a margin sacrifice to take share here? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks, Mike. So just a couple of things on the margin side of the half. So I mean, I think, again, I\u2019ll just repeat what I said is, we\u2019ll manage this business both on a growth and profitability perspective for wireless, and I think we\u2019ve proven that. look I mean, obviously the fourth quarter is always a seasonable volume quarter for the industry, and I expect that to happen again with the holiday season that\u2019s coming up.", "So it will really factoring on the volumes that what new devices, and I\u2019m sure, we\u2019re going to have plenty of new devices that come up between now and the holiday season. and if you look at phone to device side of the house, we just launched the Samsung Galaxy 3 on our 4G LTE network. And it proved the point that when we launch a very technical phone that\u2019s great when appearance and viability that people accept that phone, and that phone is selling extremely well. So all these factors come into play, but I think that we are very, very confident that what we laid out in January of 2011 regardless of what phones come, what phones don\u2019t come, and what kind of a season it will be, we will hit our financial objectives.", "On the FiOS side of the house, as I said, we did have some seasonality pressure here, but look, we have to balance the perspective; most of you\u2019d look at our wireless portfolio. we have to balance the consumer wireline portfolio in the same fashion. we have to balance growth with revenue acceleration and improving profitability. and that\u2019s what we\u2019re set out to do, and we\u2019ll make the decisions in the right ones to in order to achieve all three of those metrics.", "Michael McCormack \u2013 Nomura Securities", "Great, thanks Fran.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Mike. Brad, can we take the next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Brett Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Thanks for taking the question. Just for our own understanding that you mentioned that the distribution would not be on the agenda to next Verizon Wireless board meeting, according to me I have no idea how often the board meets, is it quarterly or semi annual. and then just to the business, you\u2019ve talked about the prep work you\u2019re doing on the 700 megahertz license sale, assuming you\u2019ll get a favorable resolution with the regulators on the contingent transactions. How quickly do you think you can move ahead with it? Do you have a sense of urgency or is it just one of the things that can take while?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Sure. Thanks, Brett. On the vote of our dividends the board meets on a quarterly basis and in each \u2013 the partnership agreements specifically states that on an annual basis the dividend will be reviewed at the end of the year. So that\u2019s really all there is to say on that.", "On the 700 A and B megahertz sale, as you know, we\u2019ve already hired a third-party, we are ready to go as soon as we get approval on the SpectrumCo deal. So, this is going to be an immediate thing, not something that\u2019s going to take a while. So we are really setup to go and it will be as fast as we can get the auction done, and make sure that we get a price that we believe is fair, and then we will sell the spectrum. So that\u2019s the timeline.", "Brett Feldman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great, thanks for that.", "John N. Doherty", "Thanks, Brett. And just an update \u2013 I continue to get updates on the IR related \u2013 website related issue. We continue to work it. We should have all documents available very shortly for those that couldn\u2019t get them. Brad, right now, it looks like we have time for two more questions. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Seitz with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Thomas Seitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Yeah, thanks for taking the question. Fran, you mentioned you\u2019re accelerating a bit the copper shutdown., in the past, you\u2019ve mentioned that a gating factor was regulatory approval to shutting down the copper plant for those that wanted circuit switched lines. I\u2019m wondering if there has been any sort of change in the local regulatory environment that allows you to accelerate that? And then secondly, I think in the past you\u2019ve mentioned the shutdowns would be in the hundreds of thousands, is that materially going up? And is that a thing where you\u2019d sacrifice a bit of margin and maybe spend a bit more CapEx to accelerate this process.", "Francis J. Shammo", "", "Okay. So on the copper shutdown piece, over the past few years we have gotten a lot of regulatory release in a lot of states on copper being the provider of last resort and those types of things. So as we go here and through our product rationalization, we are moving as quickly as we possibly can in shutting down that copper plant and obviously we did that in Dallas a year ago and we currently have one we\u2019re running in Florida that we\u2019re shutting the switch.", "So we continue down that path and we\u2019re doing that as quickly as possible, and as I said, from a FiOS to copper migration, or a copper to FiOS migration, we nearly double the amount of migrations that we did, and so we\u2019re being as aggressive as we possibly can in these areas. So from that perspective I think we\u2019re right on track.", "Thomas Seitz \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Francis J. Shammo", "", "Thanks, Tom. Brad, let\u2019s take our last question please.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "", "Thank you. Your investment in Italy was, I think, you said a $0.02 drag on EPS this quarter. How should we think about the impact over the next few quarters, and can you talk about what the strategic importance of your Italian asset and that is this going to a be drag, why not try to dispose it?", "Francis J. Shammo", "I think that given the pressures that we\u2019re seeing in Europe it\u2019s not unforeseen that there would be a pressure there in the Omnitel market of Italy. And what we\u2019re seeing is that that created a $0.02 pressure on a year-over-year basis. Strategically, I\u2019m not going to discuss whether we\u2019re going to stay a partner or not a partner, but right now it is a strategic asset for us to be a partner.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "", "And you think that $0.02 drag will continue over the next few quarters, will it get worse, how should we model it?", "Francis J. Shammo", "", "I think it will be pretty consistent.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay.", "John N. Doherty", "", "Okay. thanks, Kevin. Brad, that concludes our call. Thanks everybody, we appreciate you dialing in this morning and once again, we\u2019re doing everything we can to work on the IR related \u2013 website related issue we had this morning.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, John Doherty, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Verizon.", "John Doherty", "Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2012 earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning. I am John Doherty. With me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. This call is being webcast. If you would like to listen to a replay you can do so from our website.", "I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. I would also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I would like to cover a few items upfront. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $0.56 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $232 million or $0.08 per share for non-operational charges related to patent litigation settlements with TiVo and ActiveVideo. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.64 in the third quarter, up 14.3% year-over-year. Through nine months adjusted EPS is $1.87, an increase of 14.7% from last year. Discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of non operational items.", "As we have previously indicated, we are no longer reporting average revenue per unit or ARPU for wireless postpaid devices, instead, we are disclosing average revenue per account or ARPA which we believe is a more meaningful metric going forward given our new shared data pricing plans.", "Earlier this month, we filed a Form 8-K which disclosed 10 quarters of historical information for the following retail postpaid metrics; the number of accounts, the average connections per account and the average revenue per account. This information can also be found on our investor website. It is now part of the wireless selected operating statistics included in our financial and operating information schedules. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, John. Good morning everyone. Before we get into the details, let me start with a few comments about our financial results. We continue to execute our plan well across the entire business. Consolidated revenue growth increased to 3.9% and our strong focus on cost management and improving profitability resulted in solid double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share for the third consecutive quarter.", "This sustained operating performance together with disciplined capital spending is driving significant increases in free cash flow, resulting in capital efficiency gains and an improving return on investment profile for the overall business. Through the first nine months, we generated $13.4 billion of free cash flow, which is 50% more than last year. The wireless business is setting global benchmarks for performance and we are building significant momentum heading in to the fourth quarter and 2013.", "Service revenue growth increased to 7.5%, driven by increasing smartphone penetration and greater device adoption, stimulated by the successful and well received introduction of our Share Everything plans. This sustained revenue growth performance, together with our demonstrated ability to effectively manage cost and retain customers, resulted in a record setting EBITDA service margin of 50%, even with our strongest subscriber growth in four years.", "In Wireline, consumer revenue growth accelerated to 4.6%, a sharp increase from 2.5% in the second quarter, driven by increased FiOS revenue per customer. Enterprise and Wholesale revenues continue to be impacted by secular and global economic challenges, particularly in Europe. We are confident that our focus on improving long-term profitability through product rationalization and simplification along with process streamlining will prove to be the right decisions as we build a fundamentally stronger business.", "On September 19th we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new three-year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. We believe that this is a fair and balanced agreement that is good for our employees as well as a real positive for the future of the wireline business. I will talk more about the tentative agreement during the wireline segment review. Overall, another strong quarter of performance put solidly on-track to meet our financial objectives for the year.", "Let\u2019s begin our review with a look at consolidated results on slide four. We sustained our solid consolidated growth trends with positive contributions from all strategic areas. Consolidated revenue growth increased at 3.9%. Our operating leverage and strong focus on expense controls drove operating income up 17.9%, our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth.", "Consolidated EBITDA grew to $10 billion and our margin expanded 40 basis points sequentially to 34.6%, its highest level in nearly four years. Earnings growth also improved. As John indicated in his introductory remarks, adjusted EPS growth was more than 14% in the third quarter and is up nearly 15% year-to-date.", "Let\u2019s turn now to cash flow and capital spending on slide five. Our free cash flow increased to $5.6 billion in the quarter, driven by higher cash from operations and continued discipline in our capital spending. Capital expenditures totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, an increase of about $260 million compared to last year.", "Year-to-date, capital spending of $11.3 billion was down about 10%. My expectation is that capital spending for the full year will be lower than the $16.2 billion we incurred in 2011. In addition, we expect our annual CapEx to revenue ratio to decline based on improved revenue trends and disciplined capital spending.", "In Wireless, CapEx in the third quarter was $2.1 billion which was about $350 million higher than last year. Year-to-date, Wireless capital of $6.1 billion was lower by nearly 16%. CapEx savings this year are due primarily to lower capacity spending on the 3G network. We continue to build and expand the nation\u2019s largest 4G LTE network as more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, the migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower cost 4G LTE network will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency. Currently, more than 35% of our data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network.", "In Wireline, capital spending was $1.5 billion in the quarter down a $133 million from last year. Year-to-date, Wireline capital of $4.6 billion was about 3% lower. Our previously announced spectrum transactions all closed during the third quarter representing the net cash outlay of $3.7 billion. In return, we received about 5.9 billion Megahertz POPs of high quality AWS spectrum.", "Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt of $52.8 billion was down $2.4 billion from the end of the last year. Net debt was $43.1 billion at the end of the quarter, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.1 times.", "I would like to spend the next few minutes discussing pension liabilities and funding starting on slide six. Yesterday, after the market close, we announced that we will be transferring approximately $7.5 billion of management retiree pension benefit obligations to Prudential by purchasing a group annuity contract. Prudential will assume the responsibility in making monthly pension payments to approximately 41,000 management retirees.", "The transfer will not change the amount of the monthly pension benefit received by these retirees or their surviving beneficiaries. Pension obligations relating to active management and union represented employees and retirees are not affected. The transaction will remove about 25% of our outstanding pension liabilities upon closing which we expect to occur in December.", "Turning to slide seven, this transaction is part of an overall pension de-risking strategy and reduces our exposure to funding and income statement volatility caused by change in investment returns, discount rates and longevity risk. It also allows us to transfer this liability at reasonable economics and avoid certain administrative costs while improving the longer term financial profile of the business.", "As a result of this transaction, some additional cash funding will be required in 2012 to fully fund the pension obligations being transferred to Prudential and to maintain the funded status of the pension liabilities that will remain with Verizon. In terms of timing, we already made an additional $930 million pension contribution in September. So, on a year-to-date basis we have made $1.8 billion in contributions.", "In the fourth quarter we expect to make another $1.6 billion cash contribution. ", "Our revised outlook for pension funding in 2012 is estimated to be $3.4 billion, as compared to the $1.3 billion we estimated at the beginning of the year. While this represents more funding this year, we will have no cash funding requirements for pensions in 2013. Based on our current plan assumptions, we also expect contribution requirements in future years to be lower as a result of this transaction. ", "Let's now move into the review of the segments starting with wireless on slide 8. Our wireless business had another excellent quarter with accelerating growth in retail post paid connections, better than expected adoption and financial performance of our new Share Everything plans and strong growth in post paid revenue per count or ARPA. Even more impressive is the fact that we achieved a 50% EBITDA service margin, while activating more smartphones than any other quarter in our history, with the exception of the fourth quarter last year. ", "Total wireless revenues of $19 billion grew 7.3%, and represent 65% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue year-to-date. Retail service revenue grew 7.9% and total service revenue growth was 7.5% in both the third quarter and year-to-date. As John mentioned, we are disclosing new retail post paid metrics replacing ARPU with ARPA, as well as providing a number of post paid accounts and the average connections per account. ", "The change in reporting aligned with a strategic intent of our shared data plan, which is to encourage device adoption and stimulate usage on our wireless network. Since driving service revenue growth is the key to our business model, the more relevant metric going forward is the amount of revenue that we generate per account. ", "During the quarter, ARPA grew to more than 145 hours per month, an increase of 6.5%. In only 3 months, 13% of the retail postpaid base adopted Share Everything plans. Adoption is ahead of our expectations and ARPA dilution has been lower. As we're seeing existing customers adding devices, and increasing their data usage allowances. The combination of incremental revenue from new customers, smartphone upgrades, increased devices connecting to our network and higher usage will more than makeup for the effects of the customers initially optimizing their accounts. The voice adoption and data usage will become the primary drivers of service revenue growth for years to come.", "Lets\u2019 take a closer look at connections growth on slide 9; as we mentioned coming out of the second quarter, our retail postpaid net adds have continued to accelerate. With our strong performance, I am very confident that we continue to gain postpaid market share in the quarter. In addition to our strong device portfolio, network reliability and 4G LTE advantage, the introduction of our Share Everything plans prove to be yet another compelling reason for customers to choose Verizon.", "During the quarter, we added 1.8 million new retail net connections, with more than 1.5 million postpaid and 228,000 prepaid. We have an industry leading 95.9 million retail connections with approximately 90.4 million postpaid and 5.5 million prepaid. Our 90.4 million postpaid connections represent 34.8 million accounts, with an average of 2.6 connections per account.", "Before discussing our postpaid results in more detail, let me highlight our retail prepaid performance where we had another strong quarter. Net adds of 228,000 were significantly higher than a year ago and prepaid revenue continue to positively impact retail service revenue growth. ", "In retail postpaid our 1.5 million net adds represent a substantial sequential increase from 888,000 in the second quarter and the highest total we\u2019ve reported in four years. Roughly one-third of these net adds were internet devices, which include USB modems, jetpacks and postpaid tablets. Roughly 95% of our postpaid internet device activations this quarter were 4G LTE, which is very positive from a daily usage perspective and provides additional evidence that our Share Everything plans are stimulating device adoption.", "As you know, we are the market leader in this space with 8 million internet device connections in our retail postpaid base and more importantly, over half of these are 4G LTE. Our churn metrics continue to be market leading. Retail postpaid churn of 0.91% improved by 3 basis points year-over-year and was up only 7 basis points sequentially in what is typically a seasonally higher quarter.", "Postpaid gross adds in the quarter were very strong at $4 million, up 27% sequentially and 20% year-over-year; also the highest gross add quarter in four years. The number of customers upgrading devices was slightly less than last quarter, representing 6.8% of our retail postpaid connection space.", "Next, let\u2019s turn to slide 10 and take a look at smartphones and our progress in 4G LTE. Smartphone penetration increased from just below 50% last quarter to more than 53%, a strong quarter in terms of smartphone adoption. As expected, an increasing majority of postpaid phone sales were smartphones. In the third quarter, we activated 6.8 million smartphones, representing 79% of the total phone category; 3.4 million of these smart phones were android, of which 3 million were 4G LTE. In terms of Apple iPhones, we activated 3.1 million in the quarter, 21% of which were 4G LTE. ", "Another important point is the improving mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations. In the third quarter, the percent new to Verizon increased to 31% of total activations, a sharp improvement from the 20% t 23% range we have reported in past quarters. This higher gross add mix is recognition of our 4G LTE network advantage since an increasing percentage of our smartphone activations are 4G LTE.", "In addition within the customer upgrades 44% were buying a smartphone for the first time. In terms of 4G LTE coverage, we are by far the market leader. Our 4G LTE service is currently available in 419 markets, covering more than 250 million POPs, roughly 80% of the US population. As our TV commercial say, we have more 4G LTE coverage than all of our competitors networks combined. We will continue expanding our 4G LTE network with a goal of having a nationwide foot print similar to our 3G network next year.", "Sales of 4G LTE devices have risen steadily each and every quarter since we launched service in late 2010. In the third quarter, this increase was more dramatic as 4G LTE smartphone activations increased to 3.7 million from 2.5 million in the second quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 14.9 million 4G LTE phones and devices in our postpaid base, representing 16.5% of total retail postpaid connections. ", "Said in another way, 25% of our smartphones and 51% of our internet devices are 4G LTE. Very impressive numbers in a relatively short period of time. However, we expect these percentages to continue to ramp as all new smartphones in our device roadmap will be 4G LTE.", "Looking ahead, we see a great deal of new product development activity in end to end, particularly in healthcare and energy. We are also collaborating on in innovative video roadmap with the cable companies as part of our technology joint venture. Let\u2019s conclude our wireless review with a discussion about profitability on slide 11. We generated $8.1 billion of EBITDA in the third quarter, an increase of 12.4% and expanded our EBITDA service margin by 100 basis points sequentially to 50%.", "Again we achieved this record profitability in a quarter in which we reported the highest number of gross and net adds in four years. Simply stated our margin performance is a testament to a demonstrated and consistent ability to execute well in our strategy of achieving both growth and profitability.", "The combination of sustainable service revenue growth and intense focused on cost management and consistently excellent churn metrics are all contributing factors to our industry leading margin performance. In terms of managing our cost, we will continue to look at any and all opportunities within the business to drive process improvements and operating efficiencies.", "As I previously indicated, we identified $2 billion in cost saving opportunities in wireless this year, and we have already surpassed that target. Let's move to our Wireline segment next, starting with mass markets on slide 12.", "Mass markets revenue grew 3.8%, due primarily to accelerating growth in the consumer business. Our 4.6% revenue growth was the highest we've seen in 10 years and we are on track to achieve at least a 5% growth rate in the fourth quarter. This growth of course was driven by FiOS, where revenue grew 18% in the third quarter, and now represents about two-thirds of consumer revenue. ", "The increasing scale of FiOS is driving growth and consumer revenue per month, which increased to nearly $104 in the quarter, up 10.3%. FiOS ARPU is now over $150,000 per month, and about two-thirds of our FiOS consumer customers are triple plays with voice, internet and video services. ", "In terms of broadband customer growth, we had a 136,000 new FiOS internet additions in the quarter and now have nearly 5.3 million subscribers, representing penetration of 37%. In DSL, we had a net loss of $144,000 which is a bit higher than the last few quarters. Again, our decision to discontinue offering dry loop DSL had a negative impact on gross adds, but was clearly the right decision from a profitability standpoint. ", "In spite of the lack of net subscriber growth, broadband revenues increased both sequentially and year-over-year driven by our quantum offer and copper-to-fiber migration. In FiOS video, we added about 120,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to $4.6 million and increasing our penetration to 33%. ", "In terms of FiOS customer growth, we did experience some seasonality with respect to churn, due in part to an increase in customers moving and also some elasticity related to our price increases. Based on our current sales activity, we are expecting improvement in FiOS customer adds in the fourth quarter, along with our continuing revenue growth trajectory.", "Within mass markets, we are focused on driving revenue growth, improving operating and capital efficiency and maximizing profitability. Key actions this year included targeted price increases, new differentiated services like FiOS Quantum and our copper-to-fiber migration initiative which is helping to reduce our dependence on copper technology.", "Through nine months, we have migrated about a 150,000 homes-to-fiber and we are on-track to exceed 200,000 by the end of the year. We have already experienced a greater than 10% improvement in our Trouble Report Rate which is saving on repair costs in these areas. We are also beginning to gain some traction in up-selling new customers with additional FiOS services which will result in additional monthly recurring revenue.", "We will have more to say going forward with regard to this important initiative including how many homes will we be targeting in 2013. Suffice it to say, that we are pleased with our progress to-date and view the copper-to-fiber migration as an important part of our strategy to reduce the wireline cost structure.", "Before moving on, I would also add that our residential connection trends continue to improve. During the third quarter, we lost 217,000 retail residential connections representing a 6.3% decline year-over-year compared with a loss of 278,000 or 8% at this time last year.", "Let's move to our enterprise markets next on slide 13. As I said in my overview, our challenge in the enterprise markets is primarily one of secular pressures and global economic conditions which include foreign exchange movements. In addition, as we previously noted, we are making deliberate moves to rationalize and simplify our enterprise solutions product portfolio which is also putting near-term pressure on revenue comparisons.", "In the third quarter, Global Enterprise was down $39 million sequentially and declined a $140 million or 3.6% compared with year ago. A majority of which were due to intentional actions on our part. This includes the de-emphasis of drop-ship CPE and decommissioning end of life products like ATM, frame relay and IP VPN.", "Lower CPE sales represented a $139 million of the year-over-year decline. Foreign currency translation also had an unfavorable impact on revenue as the stronger dollar versus the euro and pound sterling caused a $40 million dollar decline in the third quarter, compared with a $37 million increase a year ago.", "We are confident that our product rationalization and streamlining initiatives will fundamentally strengthen the business and improve our operating efficiency. We are also taking actions to enhance our network, facilities and overall end-to-end service provisioning in order to put the business in a stronger position to benefit when the global economy picks up. These strategic and operational activities are creating some margin pressure in the near-term, and will result in improved profitability in 2013.", "Strategic Services, which comprised 53% of Global Enterprise revenue totaled $2 billion, up 4.4%, while we continue to perform relatively well in these services. International and FX continue to have an adverse effect on growth.", "Domestically, we are seeing new contracts and investment decisions being delayed as enterprise CIOs continue to be cautious with regard to uncertainties involving the election outcome, the pending fiscal cliff, potential tax reform and other policy changes that may take place. Collectively, these uncertainties have created a wait-and-see approach that is impacting new business. We believe that a better understanding of these impacts will help companies make decisions about their capital commitments and we are hopeful that enterprises renew their investing activities in 2013.", "During this period, Verizon Enterprise Solutions continues to strengthen its competitive position in higher growth markets like cloud computing, machine-to-machine and advanced communications. In late July, we completed the acquisition of Hughes Telematics, which will expand and accelerate our capabilities in advanced automotive, lead telematics and many other machine-to-machine services.", "Moving next to Global Wholesale, revenues in the third quarter declined $45 million sequentially and $181 million or 9.2% year-over-year due primarily to continued declines in transport services. We are taking the necessary actions to exit unprofitable routes and contracts and to better position the business in the fiber-based Ethernet data services space, as customers with special access transition from DS1s and DS3s.", "Let\u2019s move on to slide 14 next, to summarize wireline. From a topline perspective, the overall picture is mixed, with some very encouraging signs in the consumer market, while we continue to manage through secular and cynical challenges in Enterprise and Wholesale; our product rationalization initiatives, while putting some near-term pressure on revenue will ultimately serve to strengthen the business.", "At the beginning of the year, we were optimistic that EBITDA margin in the second half of 2012 would show improvement compared to the first half. As I have stated at a few investor conferences in September, we\u2019re no longer seeing this being the case, due primarily to growth challenges on the Enterprise side and the length of time it took to reach an agreement with our union.", "In addition, some of the activities to reduce our reliance on older technologies and systems along with the many processed reengineering efforts we have going, have created margin pressure in the near-term. Collectively, all these initiatives are designed to improve the Wireline cost structure. We fully expect that these and other cost management actions will result in improved profitability in 2013 and over the longer term.", "To that end, for the past 15 months we have talked about the importance of concluding our union contract negotiations and coming up with a contract that is fair and balanced for our employees, but at the same time, addresses some key issues related to our ability to achieve improvements in our cost structure.", "Let\u2019s talk a bit more about the contract on slide 15. On September 19th, we reached a tentative agreement with the CWA and IBEW for new thee year contracts covering about 43,000 associates. The contracts are currently in the ratification process which typically takes 30 days, so we hope to be able to announce a definitive agreement very soon.", "Under the tentative agreement, there are changes to medical and prescription drug plans for active and retired associates including contributions toward healthcare premiums for active employees. In addition, current retirees will make contributions toward healthcare premiums for some medical plans while associates who retire after January 1, 2013 will make premium contributions regardless of the medical plan which they enroll in.", "New associates hired from this point forward will be eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan instead of a traditional pension plan. The agreement also makes changes to old legacy policies including tighter absence controls and better quality control and training practices. There are new provisions that will result in better work rule flexibility such as national cost sharing which will improve the customer experience and allow our associates to work more efficiently and cost effectively.", "Since the contract has not yet been ratified, I am not going to quantify the annual cost savings at this time. We will have an opportunity to communicate this information at an investor conference in early November, so stay tuned for more information on this subject.", "Let's move now to our summary slide. Overall, a very good third quarter, keeping us solidly on-track to meet our financial objectives for the year. We are executing our plans and investing for the future. Consolidated revenue growth is increasing and we have had four successive quarters of EBITDA margin expansion with the third quarter being the highest margin since 2008.", "We have built strong earnings momentum with three successes of quarters of double-digit growth and have generated 50% more free cash flow than last year at this time. Our disciplined capital spending and revenue growth is driving improved capital efficiency.", "In Wireless, we further solidified our excellent spectrum position by closing all our pending transactions. And with our 4G LTE network advantage, our unmatched product portfolio and our well received Share Everything plans we feel a confident about our ability to sustain our industry leading profitability in 2013 and beyond. In Wireline, although we have work to do, we are putting the right plans in place to strengthen the business and improve profitability in 2013 and over the longer-term.", "Our strategic investments and actions position us very well for sustainable growth. We continue to build for the future and while may have some near-term challenges, we are successfully executing a well conceived plan that will drive profitability and create shareholder value in 2013 and into the future.", "With that, I will now turn the call back to John, so we can address your questions.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Fran. Brad let's open it up for questions please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "First on FiOS just a question on video; Fran you talked about certain impacts in the quarter and you talked about the potential for this to rebound next quarter. I think what you talked about in the Q2 call was sort of a normal run rate of 150 to 170, is that still a target range we should think about for 4Q? And then second question just on the pension structure in terms of the feel and the $7.5 billion, can you help us think through how that impacts the P&L, what that does to the expense stream in wireline? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "First on the FiOS growth, yeah I think that I gave a range of 150 to 170; where we came out of September I am very confident that we will get to that 150 plus for net adds in the fourth quarter, so I think that's a good target.", "And then on the pension side, I think that from a P&L perspective, it\u2019s very hard for me to distinguish at this point in time; there are so many fluctuations here. But I think the key to this whole thing a couple of points I want to make here. So from just an overall cash perspective which is the real key here, because this is really the cash impact of the business. As you know we made a first half contribution of $600 million. In the third quarter, we added another $1.2 billion to the plan, so $1.8 billion from a cash impact perspective to-date and in the fourth quarter we determined that we will put another $1.6 billion into the plan.", "All these contributions are tax deductible. We will not have any 2013 contributions and that based on our planning and the assumptions that we have in this transaction, the future cash contributions to the pension plan will be less post this transaction close, which we anticipate to be early December. So from that perspective, that to me is the important part. I think everything else is pretty minimal at this point in time.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks Fran, and you talked about this being applicable to current retirees, is there any prospects for taking this in to sort of the active employee base?", "Fran Shammo", "I think at this time, we've no more definitive agreement at this time and to extend this transaction. This transaction is specifically related to management retirees, who retire before January 1 of 2010. It does not impact current active management employees. It does not impact current active union represented employees nor does it impact retiree union represented employees.", "John Doherty ", "Thanks Jason. Brad could we move on to the next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "If we could just talk about margins little bit here; first on the wireless side, you know, last year you guys saw a little over 500 to 600 sequential decline in the fourth quarter mostly related to fourth quarter launch of the iPhone. Does the earlier launch of the iPhone sort of lower that decline along with some of the another initiatives you\u2019ve been doing. If you just could about, what do you expect from a trending standpoint there? And then on the wireline side, I know you guys don\u2019t want to give the details on the union contract, but can we start to see some of the benefits as early as the fourth quarter or what kind of trend are you looking for there?", "Fran Shammo", "So on the wireless margin, look I think that this has a lot to do with volume, right? So the iPhone 5 came out in very late September. There really wasn\u2019t all that much volume on the iPhone 5. If you look at our total iPhone adds, we added 3.1 million, 1.1 million than we did a year ago, and about 651,000 of them were iPhone 5s, the rest were 4 and 4S. ", "What we\u2019re seeing here is, we\u2019re seeing that the iPhone 5 we had supply constraints, we\u2019re not sure where we\u2019re going to stand in the fourth quarter with those constraints. But what we\u2019re seeing on the 4 and the 4S is that we\u2019re attracting customers who probably previously did not come to Verizon because of the cost point of that iPhones. So, I think you saw that in our net adds growth for the quarter.", "So, again from a trending perspective and all the work that we\u2019ve done around cost and the $2 billion, and if you look at the three years; we\u2019ve taken out $5 billion of cost structure of wireless. ", "Again, I think that given the volume, there could be some dilution in that margin. If the volumes exceed what they were in the third quarter, which I anticipate they will. If you recall back to the first quarter, I said we would accelerate our growth throughout the quarters for the year, as we come out of the third quarter. You saw we posted our highest growth in the last four years, and I think that we will accelerate that growth into the fourth quarter.", "So, yes, I think we will have some deterioration in the margins in the fourth quarter for wireless. But at this point I can\u2019t tell you what that will be, because I don\u2019t know what the volume will be. But obviously, I don\u2019t anticipate it to be as much as it was a year ago.", "Great, and then on the wireline side, I think this story is a much more complex story. But in the short, just for the union piece of this, I think, we\u2019ll wait till the fourth quarter, but you\u2019re not going to see any benefits this year. But I don\u2019t want to really get into the details until this contract is ratified. A number of unions have ratified it, but it will not be ratified by all until the next couple of days are over. So, once that happens I will give some more clarity around this add during the fourth quarter and into the first quarter.", "John Doherty ", "Thanks John. Brat could we move on to the next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Fran, could you talk to us about these 700 MHz spectrum process where you stand in that, how it\u2019s looking so far, when do you think you might be able to give us some more news on that? And then what are the implications of that and what\u2019s the likely timing of another decision on the Verizon wireless dividend to the parent Verizon and to Vodafone? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "So on the 700 MHz we started this process late in the third quarter, the process is ongoing. We have a lot of interested parties, a lot of complexity to the bidding process here from the individual respective party. So there is a lot of work to be done here and we are not ready to talk about exactly where we are with these. ", "I think the important point though is, we are going to analyze each and every bid. We are also developing our own internal plans to launch this spectrum, because as I said before, this is not a fire sale on spectrum. So if we do not get fair value or what we believe to be fair value, then we will use this spectrum internally. ", "But at this point I think it\u2019s too early to communicate exactly how this will proceed, but I think it will happen late in the fourth quarter possibly not till the first quarter, and if we do come to terms with some of these than it has to go through the normal FCC approval. We are probably very close on that, probably till late third quarter, fourth quarter of 2013. ", "As far as Vodafone dividend; this is a very interesting question. Because I think we all forget that on January of 2012 we actually did do a dividend that\u2019s $10 billion, and throughout the year during our normal course we did about another $4.5 billion of tax distributions. So year-to-date, we have done $14.5 billion of dividend distributions out of wireless. ", "To talk about a further dividend, I think it\u2019s pretty mature, we have an agreement with Vodafone that we will discuss this before the end of the year, and once we have that discussion and we will report out what the decision will be.", "John Doherty ", "Brad could we move on to the next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Phil Cusick - JPMorgan", "Two things, one I wonder, if you can tell us whether substantially higher portion of phones came in with no subsidy this quarter, people paying for price and it is [down] their previous plan that happened in the past?", "Fran Shammo", "Yeah, Phil, so obviously, if you look at our growth and you look at the number of phones we have moved, the majority of the phones sales incurred a subsidy on them. But we did have a number of customers who actually paid full price for phones to remain on the unlimited plan. So we did have some customers who made that choice and stayed with Verizon Wireless. ", "But for the majority most of the smartphones that we sold included a subsidy. But we also had our large volume in our postpaid tablet category, and we also had a large volume in our internet category, and they carry for the postpaid tablets at really no subsidy. And on the internet devices, we almost doubled the amount of net adds we had from second quarter to third quarter, which was a contribution to our Share Everything plan and they have a reduce subsidy compared to what a smartphone would be, but the majority of devices did have a subsidy.", "Phil Cusick - JPMorgan", "You mentioned that given the Septembers results you expect FiOS to be over a 150. Is that more a seasonal shift or are you putting a little more effort in to promotion and marketing here?", "Fran Shammo", "Well I think it\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. Number one, I think as I said coming out of second quarter, we probably moved away a little bit too much of promotional activity. So we picked that up in September, and the third quarter is a very high seasonality of moves for us and this is always a third quarter issue with FiOS, because people move out of the area and we can't retain them because they move to an area that does not have FiOS availability to them. ", "We are doing a lot of effort in reconnecting existing homes that already have an O&T on the side of the house, for people who have moved in. So you are going to see a lot more activity around that. I also think that we did see some pressure in the current phase from the price upset we had. And I think those price ups were all done now, so I think we are going to stabilize here and I'm very comfortable that we\u2019ll get back to that 150,000 plus for net add projection.", "John Doherty ", "Thanks Phil. Brad the next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tom Seitz of Jefferies.", "Tom Seitz - Jefferies", "Fran I would like to discuss copper shutdown a little bit. AT&T has publicly stated that for them to invest in the 20 million access lines they have got under a strategic review, they are going to need relief from copper circuit-switched TDM regulations. If they were to get that, would you consider applying for the same relief and accelerating the copper shutdown? ", "I ask because at current course and speed in the neighborhood of $200,000 conversions per year that's 50 plus years to shutdown the redundant copper plant, and its probably the largest structural impediment to improving wireline margins. ", "Fran Shammo", "From a copper shutdown perspective its highly unlikely that you will ever see a Verizon have no copper in their network, because of the vastness of this network. But I think strategically the way we have approached this from a copper-to-fiber migration all copper is not created equal. We have areas where the copper has really deteriorated because its 60 years plus, and we are strategically going after what we call chronic troubles and that is a truck roll that happens in a period of six months time and that costs us about 900 hours in cash from a perspective of that. ", "So, when you look at the overall investment that we have to make to migrate that customer from copper to FiOS, its more cost effective to go after those chronic problems first. But not all of the network that leads into one switch is having these chronic problems. So to think about decommissioning every switch in our network would be a huge cost undertaking. ", "So we believe that the strategy we've outlaid with our copper-to-fiber migration is financially viable, it\u2019s better for the customer, we see that from the customers who we have migrated in the short term, they are actually buying up in the FiOS quantum and generating $10 plus more ARPU. So we are strategically going after this. ", "We have also received a lot of regulatory relief already in the states that we deal with, from being a carrier of lost resort, replacing in Pennsylvania, fulfilling our obligation of bringing broadband to customers via (PA30) rulings which would be with wireless instead of wireline, which is a much more financial beneficial to Verizon. So we have already explored a lot of this regulatory highway and we will continue with our copper to fiber migration under the plan that we are executing. ", "John Doherty ", "Thanks Tom. Brad the next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "First if I could ask my quarterly question for an update on the net debt at Verizon wireless, and then secondly just moving over to the wireline side, can you give us an update on the VDMS segment and just the strategy that you are continuing to pursue there, the progress including the relationship that you have with Redbox? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Sure thanks, Mike. So your general normal quarterly question I have it right here is gross debt of $10 billion, cash of $8.1, so net debt of about $1.9 billion. And then on the Wireline side of house was VDMS; we are making significant progress. We have been dealing with, what we call a number of chartered customers which includes many content providers and movie houses in helping us to customize this package and get this thing to market. We anticipate that it will come to market in 2013; I won't be specific on that date at this point in time, but we believe we have a very viable product to come to marketplace that will significantly change the way content is, if you will, packaged and picked and shipped. So we will have more to say on that within 2013, but I think that will start to contribute to some of the Wireline top growth and help to improve the margin overall.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "Thanks very much.", "Fran Shammo", "I am sorry, I mentioned Redbox. Now, we are very close to launching here in the fourth quarter of Redbox. VDMS plays a very critical role in the content delivery with that joint-venture with Redbox and again, I think moving into 2013, the business case that we have with us with Redbox will improve our topline and contribute to the profitability of the overall Wireline segment.", "John Doherty", "Alright, let\u2019s keep this moving. Thanks Mike. Brad lets take the next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Great, thank you, Fran. If I could, could you provide a little color on your CapEx trend; I understand you are saving on the 3G spend, but given these impacts of postpaid net add results and growth in internet devices, I would think you would need to continue to spend on capacity. I guess I am just trying to understand if this is all benefited following 3G or also a result of your spectrum position?", "Fran Shammo", "", "Yeah, thanks Jennifer for the question. I think that from a CapEx perspective as I said all along, I believe that 2012 would be flat, I am saying now it will definitely be down from our 2011 spend; I think the trajectory in the \u201913 will be very similar to the \u201912. I think what you\u2019ll see is what you saw in the third quarter that we continue to very closely manage the CapEx on the Wireline side of the business, meanwhile Wireless will continue with their plan to build out the 4G LTE by mid-year, next year compared to our 3G footprint. I don\u2019t see a substantial change in the CapEx trajectory here, but obviously, this does depend on growth and we hang our hat on being the best network, most reliable network in the industry and that we\u2019re not going to loose that position. So Wireless has been A plus in this area and I don\u2019t believe that will change, but I don\u2019t think there is a significant change in the capital trajectory here.", "John Doherty", "", "Thanks, Jennifer. Brad, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open.", "Mike McCormack - Nomura", "Fran, maybe just a quick comment, you talked a little bit about the cover migration process and yeah there\u2019s obviously some leg to that and the longer term benefits I think are pretty clear, but just give us a sense if you can as to maybe the magnitude of margin pressure as you do that migration process over the next two year or so?", "And then, secondly on the Wireless side, we\u2019ve had this sort of honeymoon with the change in policy with respect to upgrade window that I think should be coming to a close right about now. So as we look into the fourth quarter and you\u2019ve got this pool of people that are now upgrade eligible, that have not been for the last six months. How should we be thinking about upgrade percentages as we go through maybe both 4Q as well as 1Q? Thanks.", "", "Fran Shammo", "Hey thanks Mike. So migration in Wireline pressure I guess there is a couple of things here and it\u2019s not just the migration, but obviously doing some of this work does increase some CapEx to us and thus increase some of the operating expense to us, but I would say that\u2019s in combination with a lot of other things that we are doing. But this positions us for the future. I would say though that beyond this from a pressure standpoint on Wireline obviously the third quarter to us is always a seasonal pressure point from a weather condition, the construction issue, fiber cuts and so forth, so that\u2019s not unusual for the third quarter to be a bigger margin pressure for us.", "But the delay of the union contract had an impact on our margins, the Hughes results, obviously if you go back and look at Hughes on a standalone basis, they contribute to dilution in the Wireline segment because that is now included in the Wireline. As we said, we are in the process of retooling the enterprise which is putting a little bit of pressure in the expense category with system consolidation and product rationalization.", "And then we have also deliberately have gone out during the third quarter and we will probably do a little bit of this in the fourth quarter and accelerated some of the repairs and maintenance within our facilities. We are also doing some additional work in our networks to increase our diversity and reliability within the Wireline network. So there is a lot of things that\u2019s putting a little bit of pressure on the Wireline, but again I think we are taking this opportunity during the low of the economic condition, preparing for this economic turn that hopefully will come in 2013 and I think we will be in a better position to ride that wave when it comes. So I think it\u2019s a combination of all that.", "And then on the Wireless side, the upgrade window, I guess the way I would put it this way is, our upgrade percentage will be more in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter, but I will tell you, I think it will be less in the fourth quarter of a year ago.", "Mike McCormack - Nomura", "Okay. And just, I am sorry, just circle backing the Wireline side, should you be thinking about the third quarter is not the right starting point as we go in the fourth quarter, if it\u2019s the seasonality impact, we\u2019ll be looking at 2Q as the run rate?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I think what I would say is for the third and the fourth quarter, I think you will see similar performance here, while we reposition ourselves, but this will position us for improved profitability in 2013.", "John Doherty", "Thanks Mike. Brad, the next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "Thank you. There are a lot of questions this week on what the impact would be from the (inaudible) entry into the U.S. Does this at all change the way you run your business over the next couple of years, whilst Sprint and T-Mobile are going for the regulatory approval integration and network build out processes and what if anything will be the long term impact on Verizon\u2019s Wireless business?", "Fran Shammo", "So let me just start out with the couple of things here, because it\u2019s important. First, as I said in few of the investor conferences, I anticipated and we suspected some consolidation. And I think what the market should walk away with here is that there are two very large companies willing to invest in the U.S. wireless market. I believe this is a sign and it is very good for the industry and I think this shows the strength of the U.S. market and the growth potential that\u2019s still available within this market. I think, what this means from us is a couple of things.", "First, if you go back to January, 2011, the biggest that Lowell and I made was, we are all about executing on our plans. We have invested and built and remain on our brand to be the best and most reliable network. We have pioneered, launched and now are the largest 4G LTE network with more coverage than all of our competitors combined. I think if you look at our spectrum holding, we have a superior spectrum holding and quality of spectrum with our 700 MHz contiguous across the United States which we've launched our 4G LTE network launch on, and with the closing of our AWS spectrum with the cable companies.", "So I think we are in a very strong position from a spectrum holding perspective. If you look at our capital, and in the past we've taken a little heat from the market for the amount of capital that we have spent on our networks. But if you look at, on average we spend about $10 billion per year investing in our wireless and our wireline IP backbone support for that wireless network, and I think at the end of the day, you would all agree that execution equal results here. I think the third quarter results speak for themselves. So we will continue to execute and we will continue to lead the industry.", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "Just a quick question, new reports indicate Isis is finally launching on Monday. Can you confirm this and what's the strategy going to be there to compete against Square, Google Wallet and others. ", "Fran Shammo", "I think that at this point we let Isis answer those questions. They are going to launch and we will see how the trial markets doing, and then we will go from there.", "John Doherty ", "Thanks Kevin. Brad can we take next one please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "Now that we are getting some visibility here on the number of postpaid accounts that you have, I was wondering if you can give us a little more color here on the portion of them that are business accounts. And then just sticking with Share Everything, it sounds like the initial benefit you got out of the gate was that households are starting to attach internet devices like tablets and other and MiFi. Was that the principal benefit or did you actually see an increase in the attachment rate of smartphones on existing households, mean that maybe homes were taking advantage of the plan to consolidate people who maybe, have been on different carriers all on to Verizon.", "Fran Shammo", "So on the accounts, we're not going to split the accounts here between business and consumer. We will just leave it as we will give the accounts, we will give the devices per account and the ARPA on that. ", "As far as the Share Everything plans, I think the best answer is we're seeing a little bit of everything. We're seeing our customers move from their old legacy plants. We're seeing customers who were on unlimited plans, move to Share Everything plan. Now you would think that these initial customers that moved are optimizing from that. But what we're seeing is that they are attaching more devices. That includes more smartphones, and especially with the price points now and some of the lower end iPhones that we're seeing more attachment rates there. ", "We're seeing a lot of attachment on internet, Wi-Fi devices. And I think what we're seeing is they are attaching the MiFi device at $20 price point, rather than each individually attaching a tablet. So, I think we're seeing very good success in MiFi attachment rates, and from tablets, we're seeing some of that but probably not as much as we had expected. But the MiFi attachment is running extremely higher than we expected. So I think overall, again, what we're seeing in Share Everything is better than what we had expected in our business case.", "John Doherty", "Thanks Brad. Brad, we are going to take two more questions. I know folks you\u2019ve had a busy night with our pension release as well as - that\u2019s why we got our earnings out a little bit early. So we will take two more. I know you also have another busy day ahead of you with some other meetings. So let\u2019s move on for two more questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Fran, two questions; one related to the data side of things. It looks like Sprint and T-Mobile are really going to be focused on unlimited data. As they get their networks up to speed in a few years, how do you convey to your customers that, your share data is still economical and makes sense for customers like, really how you\u2019re positioned against that? And do you think they can continue to afford to do it? ", "Secondly, as these companies really restructure their networks in the next two years, historically have you been able to capture share to those periods, and do you think you\u2019ll be able to kind of do that again, I know it\u2019s early stages with what PCS and T-Mobile are doing, and what Sprint\u2019s but maybe your expectations for the next few years in share gains?", "Fran Shammo", "I tried to answer your question in my speech on industry consolidation, but maybe I didn\u2019t do a good enough job. But on the data side of the house, I think our network and our competitive advantage speaks for itself. And I think superiority of our network; I think what you\u2019re seeing is that we\u2019re competing in that arena today against the unlimited plans. ", "As far as the network goes, we\u2019ve invested $10 billion, probably in the last 10 years in our network. It\u2019s going to be difficult for others to make that within two years as you say. So, I think that\u2019s a longer term plan. But, look it\u2019s all good for the industry. The industry is focused on the growth, but there is a lot of opportunity out there, and we\u2019ve proven that we can be a leader in the industry and we\u2019ll continue to do that.", "John Doherty", "Thanks, Tim. Brad, this will be the last question.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Chaplin - Credit Suisse Securities", "Looking at the upgrade rate, it looks like you are on a trend to have an upgrade rate this year that\u2019s below your historical rate of about 32% a year. Can that continue to go down in 2013, and if it does, with the 50% EBITDA margins in wireless this quarter, where can wireless EBITDA margins go next year and longer term? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "On the upgrade rate, yes, I do think it will decline. There is a lot of things that we took in place from 2010 all the way through, but I think that that will continue happen. As I said in the fourth quarter, it will be more than the third quarter obviously; but I think we will be less than a year ago and I see that trend continuing. ", "As far as wireless margins, I will leave at this. If you trend out on a graph over the last 10 years what wireless has done given we grow and more profitable, you will see that we will continue to manage that balance and continue to increase our overall portfolio in our profitability.", "John Doherty", "Thanks Jonathan. Brad that concludes our call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator instructions.]  It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, senior vice president, investor relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our chief financial officer, Fran Shammo.  Thank you for joining us this morning", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be available on our website later today.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website. ", "I would also point out that the quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.  There were no special items of a nonoperational nature included in our reported earnings results for the first quarter of either this year or last.  ", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.  ", "Fran Shammo ", "Thanks, Mike.  Good morning everyone.  We entered this year with strong momentum, and we are seeing our strategic investments driving an excellent start to 2013.  Earnings per share of $0.68 was up 15.3%.  Our investment returns are improving and becoming more evident in our results.", "Our strategic focus is on building networks and platforms as the foundation for innovation and growth.  By investing consistently in these networks and platforms, we have positioned the business to take advantage of growth opportunities in the rapidly evolving markets for broadband, video, and cloud services.", "Our investments in 4G LTE enables us to provide a superior customer experience in wireless broadband and video.  Our investments in fiber to the home enable a leading broadband and video experience to FiOS customers through higher speeds and capacity.  Our investments in global IP, managed services, cloud computing, security, and machine-to-machine enable our ability to serve the complex needs of large enterprise customers around the globe.", "Our operational focus is on execution, which means performing the basics every day.  In short, our approach is to meet customer needs by delivering products and services in the most efficient and effective way.  Our implementation of Share Everything plans is simplifying decisions for customers, making it easier to upgrade and add devices while eliminating the need for separate data plans for each device.", "Our FiOS Quantum offer and copper to fiber migration initiative are examples of improving service quality and increasing operational efficiency.  In enterprise, our ongoing retooling efforts, which include product rationalization and systems consolidation, will result in a more efficient and effective service delivery model.  ", "Verizon\u2019s Lean Six Sigma principles are being adopted across the entire business, and we are beginning to see efficiency gains in many areas, including customer care, supply chain, and system support, to name a few.  As we move through the year, successful execution in our key strategic areas will drive incremental revenue and better operating efficiency, resulting in continued growth in free cash flows and earnings.", "Let me shift now to our first quarter performance, hitting a few highlights.  Our wireless results were strong, striking a favorable balance between growth and profitability.  We added 677,000 retail postpaid connections, up 35% year over year.  Service revenue grew 8.6%, and our EBITDA service margin was 50.4%, which was right in line with our guidance.", "FiOS also had a strong quarter of customer and revenue growth.  We added 188,000 new FiOS internet subscribers and had 169,000 FiOS video additions.  FiOS revenue grew 15.1%, and RPU was over $150 a month.  In global enterprise, strategic services revenue continued to increase, up 6% year over year.  Free cash flows in the first quarter increased $1.5 billion, or 64%, on the strength of higher cash from operations.  ", "Now let\u2019s take a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide four.  Total operating revenue grew 4.2%, sustaining our solid top line growth performance.  For the quarter, the increase in consolidated revenues, coupled with effective cost management, resulted in 19.8% growth in operating income.  Consolidated EBITDA also grew at a double digit rate, up 12.1%, while our EBITDA margin expanded by 240 basis points to 35.1%.", "Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on slide five.  Our consistent investment in wireless drives our leadership in network quality, reliability, and the overall customer experience.  ", "Five years ago, we committed to 4G LTE as the next generation technology, and we have taken all the necessary steps to take advantage of this growth opportunity.  These actions include securing necessary spectrum, allocating capital to deploy 4G LTE nationwide, fostering a robust device and application ecosystem, and introducing a revolutionary pricing framework with our Share Everything plans for consumer and small business.", "Once again, through solid execution of our strategy, the wireless results speak for themselves.  We also knew that by taking advantage of the unique market growth opportunities in the fourth quarter, we would quickly realize the benefit.  Our first quarter results prove this out.  Total wireless revenues grew to $19.5 billion, and now represent two-thirds of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue.", "Our strong momentum in terms of connections growth and smartphone penetration drove first quarter service revenue growth of 8.6%.  As expected, profitability rebounded quickly following the high quality device activations of the fourth quarter.  EBITDA grew to $8.4 billion, up 18.1%, and our industry leading EBITDA service margins expanded to 50.4%, up 410 basis points over the first quarter of 2012.", "Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at wireless revenue and accounts, beginning on slide six.  The increase in service revenue was driven by a combination of factors, including customer growth and increased smartphone penetration.  ", "The popularity and simplicity of our Share Everything plans is driving increases in both the revenue and number of devices per account.  During the first quarter, retail postpaid service revenue per account, or RPA, grew to more than $150 per month, an increase of 6.9%.  Connections per account increased to 2.67, up 5.1%.", "In just nine months, 30% of our postpaid account base is on a Share Everything plan.  Customers have quickly recognized the value of shared data across multiple devices.  In late January, we also introduced Share Everything plans for small business, which allow for up to 25 devices per account.  In terms of the number of postpaid accounts, our Share Everything plans have resulted in consolidation of accounts.  Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide seven.", "In the first quarter, we added 677,000 new retail postpaid connections, an increase of 35.1% year over year.  Last year, postpaid connections increase sequentially each quarter, and we expect a similar pattern of accelerating growth in 2013.  ", "We have an industry leading 98.9 million retail connections, with 93.2 million postpaid and 5.7 million prepaid.  Our postpaid connections represent 34.9 million accounts.  Postpaid gross adds in the first quarter totaled 3.5 million, up 15.6% year over year.  In terms of upgrades, 6.7% of our postpaid connections base upgraded during the quarter.  ", "Our churn metrics continue to be market leading.  Retail postpaid churn was 1.01%.  During the quarter, we implemented several process improvements in the area of bad debt collections related to our Lean Six Sigma initiative.  These improvements resulted in an acceleration of involuntary churn, which we expect will be lower in future periods.", "Now let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE.  In the first quarter, we activated 9.7 million postpaid devices, 87% of which were phones.  Smartphone activations totaled 7.2 million, and 68% of these were 4G LTE.  We activated 4 million iPhones.  Half of them are 4G LTE and the other half were 3G.  ", "Our smartphone penetration increased to 61%, up from 58% at the end of last year.  A key point of differentiation for us and incremental revenue is the improved mix of gross adds and upgrades within our smartphone activations.  In the first quarter, gross adds, or new to Verizon customers, represented about 28% of the total smartphone activations, much higher than the 22-24% range we reported in the first half of 2012.", "We also have incremental revenue opportunities with upgrades.  About 38% of customers upgrading this quarter were buying a smartphone for the first time.  I would also note that when customers upgrade from a 3G to a 4G LTE smartphone, they are usually in a shared data plan, enabling higher usage and additional device adoption, which ultimately drives higher revenue per account.", "Customer adoption of 4G LTE continues to accelerate.  At the end of the first quarter, 4G LTE phones and devices represented more than 28% of total retail postpaid connections.  40% of smartphones and 63% of internet devices are now 4G LTE, and 54% of our total data traffic is already on the 4G LTE network, which is 5 times more efficient than 3G.", "In terms of 4G LTE geographic coverage, we are by far the market leader.  Today, our 4G LTE service is available in 491 markets, covering 287 million [pops], representing more than 95% of our 3G coverage.  ", "We will continue to leverage our advantage and expect that our 4G LTE footprint will effectively match our 3G network by the end of the second quarter.  Network quality and reliability will continue to be the hallmarks of the Verizon brand, and we will continue to invest to maintain our leadership position.", "Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment, starting on slide nine.  In wireline, our investments in FiOS, global IP, security, cloud, and machine-to-machine provide powerful platforms to deliver the services and leading edge applications and solutions that our customers are looking for.  These services are increasingly efficient, and in the long run, will help improve our cost structure.", "In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive signs, highlighted by 15.1% FiOS revenue growth this quarter.  In addition to increasing FiOS penetration, we are focused on improving our operating and capital efficiency.  We are also making good progress in our copper to fiber migration program.", "In enterprise, we continue to see mixed performance.  Our strategic service revenue grew 6%, but declines in core services like voice and data transport, as well as CPE more than offset the increase.  In terms of wireline profitability, first quarter EBITDA was $2.1 billion, and the margin was 21.4%, roughly flat sequentially if we set aside the impacts of Sandy in the fourth quarter.", "As we have previously indicated, we do not expect much in the way of total wireline EBITDA margin expansion in 2013.  However, the continued strong performance of FiOS, our copper to fiber initiative, and the benefits of new union contracts give us confidence that consumer and mass markets will contribute positively to wireline profit this year.", "In enterprise, while growth in strategic services continued to improve the revenue mix, secular declines in both retail and wholesale voice and data transport services are putting pressure on wireline profitability.  We believe that our ongoing product rationalization efforts and other retooling efforts will ultimately improve our cost structure and result in a fundamentally stronger enterprise business.", "Looking ahead, we are positioned to improve the wireline margin in 2014, based on better contributions from our strategic investments, which include Redbox Instant, Hughes Telematics, and Verizon Digital Media Services.  Let\u2019s take a closer look at the revenue components, starting with mass markets on slide 10.", "FiOS is the foundation of our growth strategy in the consumer market, and it shows in our first quarter results.  Consumer revenues grew 4.3%, driven by increased FiOS revenue, which now represents 69% of consumer revenue.  FiOS is also the key driver of growth in overall consumer RPU, which increased to more than $107 per month, up 9.5%.", "FiOS RPU remains at over $150 per month, and two-thirds of our FiOS consumer customers are triple play, with voice, internet, and video services.  As I highlighted earlier, FiOS customer growth was strong in the first quarter. In terms of broadband, we had 188,000 new FiOS internet additions in the quarter, and now have 5.6 million subscribers, representing penetration of 38%. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 99,000, marking a sharp improvement over the past several quarters.  ", "In FiOS video, we added 169,000 subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 4.9 million, which is 34% penetration.  We continue to make steady progress, upgrading copper services to fiber, increasing the number of upgrades each quarter.  ", "We are off to a strong start, converting about 83,000 homes in the first quarter, with a target of 300,000 for the year.  This network evolution initiative is important for us as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies throughout the business.  Aside from the obvious expense benefits and improvements in customer satisfaction, the conversion to fiber also provides customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional RPU over time.", "Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends.  Retail residential connections declined by 5.6%, compared with a loss of 6.8% at this time last year.", "Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next, on slide 11.  In the first quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $99 million, or 2.6%.  CPE sales, which we are deemphasizing, represented all of the decrease.  Strategic services, which comprise 56% of global enterprise revenue, totaled $2.1 billion, up 6%.  Continued declines in voice and data transport offsets this increase.", "In the enterprise market, we continue to work through economic challenges.  We still see cautious behavior on the part of many enterprise customers in terms of new contracts and investment decisions.  As we move through the year, we are hopeful that companies will be able to be more definitive about capital commitments and will renew their investing activities.", "Moving next to global wholesale, first quarter revenues declined $134 million, or 7.2%, due primarily to continued declines in transport services.  Again, our strategy is to better monetize our global IP network by driving a more efficient migration to next generation Ethernet services.", "I would like to turn now to slide 12 to discuss our cash flow results.  Our free cash flow in the first quarter was very strong.  Cash flows from operations grew $1.6 billion, or 26.4%, and free cash flow increased to $3.9 billion.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter were $3.6 billion, essentially flat year over year.  We remain focused on improving investment returns and capital efficiency and we are expecting our capex to revenue ratio for the full year to decline.  ", "In wireless, capital spending totaled $2 billion, up 5.7%.  Within our overall spending outlook, we expect to allocate more capital to 4G LTE to further expand coverage and add capacity.  With regard to capacity, we have started to incur some capital costs associated with the AWS spectrum, which we expect to deploy in our network later in the year.  ", "In wireline, capital spending was $1.4 billion in the quarter, down 6.7%.  Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong.  Our total debt at the end of the first quarter was $52.9 billion.  Net debt was $47.4 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x.", "Let\u2019s summarize on slide 13.  As we stated earlier, we entered 2013 with great confidence.  Our strategic investments and operational execution drove a solid financial start to the year.  We expect to sustain this positive momentum throughout 2013 and into 2014.  We are committed to driving shareholder value by executing our plans and improving the fundamentals of the business.", "Our focus is to capture incremental revenue growth in our key strategic areas.  At the same time, we will continue to transform our service delivery and cost structures through the Verizon Lean Six Sigma initiative.  As always, we will continue to invest in a disciplined manner, ensuring that we have the necessary platforms for innovation and growth.  Through this strategy and execution model, we expect to drive cash flow and earnings growth.", "Before I turn the call back to Mike, I want to take a moment to say a word about the tragedy that has unfolded this week around the Boston Marathon.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.  This is a very tough situation for so many people.  We also want to thank our employees in the Boston area for their work and support of emergency personnel and law enforcement authorities.  Verizon of course will continue to do whatever it can to help.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Mike for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.]  Our first question will come from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs.  Your line is open.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "", "First, on wireless, a very good margin results this quarter.  I guess when we think about the prior guide you had given, 49-50% margins for the year, I think a lot of people sort of worry that we\u2019ll have good margins in the first three quarters of the year, only to give a lot of it back in the fourth quarter.  I guess related to this, last week you announced the intention to lengthen the handset upgrade cycle to 24 months.  A couple of questions.  Was that contemplated in this guidance?  And then just given the timing of that, which I think kicks in in September, do you think that sort of derisks the fourth quarter relative to historical experiencing?", "And the second question, I guess I\u2019ll take a crack at the Vodafone question.  There\u2019s been obviously a lot more noise recently on the future of that relationship.  And I\u2019m just wondering, is this the press and the analyst community really getting ahead of themselves?  Or has there been some sort of change related to the partners\u2019 desire and urgency to find a resolution?  ", "Fran Shammo ", "On the 49-50%, if you recall back to what I said in the first quarter, we said that we expected Verizon Wireless, for the full year, to be within the range of 49-50%.  And obviously when I do something like that, I understand exactly what\u2019s on our plate of strategy for the year.  And we had said before that we look at all of our policies and procedures on a normal basis, and this was one of those policies that we knew we were going to change.  ", "And as you said, it\u2019s going to become effective September 1 and in essence what it does is it lessens our upgrade cycle from the -4 month from contract equal to the contract, so a full 24 months to be eligible for that upgrade.  So I think that\u2019s all factored in with what I have said coming into this year, and that\u2019s why I was confident with the 49-50% on the full year basis.  ", "And then with respect to Vodafone, obviously we made a public announcement on April 2 and I would reference all of you back to that announcement.  Of course, as we\u2019ve always said before, we\u2019re very interested in acquiring the 45% stake in Verizon Wireless that we don\u2019t already own.  ", "I will say, though, that there has been a lot of speculation about the tax consequences of a purchase of this 45%, and we are extremely confident that such a transaction could be accomplished in a manner that is very tax-efficient, and would not result in a tax on the gain in that stake.  So beyond that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s really much else to say.  So at that, I\u2019ll pass it on to the next question.  ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley.  Your line is open.  ", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "On the enterprise, just any impact or comments on sequestration?  Is that having any material impact?  Some of the comments you made about cautious spending.  And then onto quad play.  We\u2019ve seen both in Europe and also with some of the comments out of Dish this week around focusing on bundling wireless with video and with other wireline products.  You talk a lot about your triple play.  You have the cable JV.  Can you just give us your broader thoughts on bundling wireless more closely with some of the FiOS and other products either now or down the road?", "Fran Shammo ", "On the enterprise side of the house, we\u2019re seeing a lot of issues around enterprise.  I think the sequestering has probably hit more of the government and state side of the house than it has the overall enterprise side of the house.  ", "But on a much broader perspective around enterprise, obviously we believe that our platforms are there.  We\u2019re having good growth in the areas of our cloud and our network strategies, our security is still growing at a good pace.  ", "But obviously the voice and the data continue to offset this, and I don\u2019t really see a change there given the fact that we really have not seen a consistent and steady economic growth profile.  We have not seen a consistent and steady employment rate.  I still think there\u2019s some uncertainty out there around what\u2019s going to happen with tax reform.  ", "So again, I believe that most companies are still in this cost cutting mode, really not investing but trying to get their P&L squared away.  So until the overall macroeconomics change, I think we\u2019re going to be in this situation at least for the near term here.", "And then on the quad play, obviously we believe that the quad play is extremely important.  That\u2019s why we entered into the cable agreement that we did a year ago with the cross-selling agreements and also with the joint innovation that we have agreed to do.  Because I think that this is very important, because as we look at how do we innovate and bring content in and outside of the home on a seamless perspective, this is where that all comes into play.  And I think Dish has just, again, supported what we knew a year ago, which was this strategy is the right strategy.", "The other thing I\u2019ll say is that with this, it also supports the fact that you have a foreign investor who wants to come into the North American wireless footprint.  You have a domestic investor who wants to gain share in the wireless footprint.  This again just confirms our overall belief that the wireless industry still has a lot of growth left in it, both on the quad play and with the innovation of machine-to-machine and 4G LTE.  So I think that\u2019s where we sit with the quad play.  ", "Operator", "Our next question will come from John Hodulik of UBS.  Your line is open.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "First, on the wireline side, the wholesale revenue decline improved nicely for the last couple of quarters.  Is that really a function of the repositioning work you guys have done in VES?  Or are there some other more macro trends driving that?  And can we expect to see that improvement continue?", "And then over in wireless, it looks like, as I look at your prepaid and reseller numbers, it looks like prepaid was a little bit lighter than we thought, despite a price cut.  And then you had stronger reseller numbers.  Can you talk a little bit about your strategy in both of those categories and what we can expect going forward?", "Fran Shammo ", "On the wholesale side of the house, I would tell you I believe that this is timing.  And I think that if I had to predict what was going to happen the rest of the year, I think we\u2019re going to be around this 8-9% decline in wholesale.  And it is mainly around, again, the drive behind volumes of voice and data.  ", "And again, it points back to everything I talked about in enterprise, because most of the volume that we get on wholesale are people who resell that to enterprise customers and other customers for voice and data.  So I agree with you.  It has slowed a bit, but I think we\u2019re probably in a period of it\u2019s not going to improve here in the future.", "As far as prepaid goes, I guess a couple of things here.  As I\u2019ve said before, in the prepaid market, we will look for niches to play that really complement what we want to be as a carrier in the prepaid market.  And I\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re not going to chase the low end on our retail side of the house, but we will look for niches where we can make impact.  ", "And I guess I would say this is the eighth consecutive quarter of a net add positive on our prepaid in retail.  As you said, we launched new pricing here in the first quarter.  It was mid first quarter, so we don\u2019t really have the full impact of the quarter here on what we launched as smartphone pricing, which was the first time we\u2019d launched a smartphone pricing on prepaid.  We also launched a $35 plan to really go after the basic phone category with a little bit of data in that. ", "So you\u2019re seeing us become, I wouldn\u2019t say over aggressive, but maybe a little bit more aggressive.  But again, it ties into our network strategy of using the 3G network and keeping that network full, because it contributes a lot of margin.  The other thing is, as I\u2019ve said in the past, we will always play in both arenas, between retail and wholesale, depending upon what drives the most value for Verizon shareholders.  ", "And you saw this quarter, through a relationship that we have with one of our resellers, with the distribution agreement to Walmart, we added 1 million net subs on that side of the house, which was really all prepaid subs.  ", "So, again, balancing out where we think the most favorable financial position is for us, to get the greatest return.  That\u2019s how you\u2019ll see us going forward in the prepaid market.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research.  Your line is open.  ", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "", "First, if you could just give us an update on the ending balance for Verizon Wireless net debt?  And then secondly, when we look at some of the numbers in the wireless business, it looks like the postpaid customer device replacement cycle is lengthening.  And I was curious if you could talk about the reasons for that.  Do you think it\u2019s because of the policy changes that you\u2019ve made over the last couple of years?  Are you seeing any resistance from customers upgrading to the new shared plans that you\u2019ve laid out?  Just curious for some of your thoughts on that subject.", "Fran Shammo ", "Verizon Wireless debt gross is $10 billion, cash is $3.9 billion, for a net of $6.2 billion.  On the device lineup, obviously if you look at what we have done over the last two years, what we plan to do coming here in the fourth quarter, if you look at the ecosystem of these devices, these are highly subsidized devices, and we have to make sure that we position the value to Verizon and the value to our customer on an equal basis.  ", "So what you\u2019ve seen over the last two years in modifying the policies to make sure that we can still offer a great lineup of phones at a reasonable price to our consumers for a two-year service contract, you\u2019re seeing us lengthen that cycle.  ", "And to be honest, we\u2019re not seeing a lot of resistance here.  You have to understand that a lot of the upgrades were proactive by us, not by our customers.  And so we\u2019re really just repositioning that the date of an upgrade is two years now instead of, say, 20 months.  ", "We don\u2019t anticipate that there will be a lot of dissatisfaction here, but we have to watch this carefully.  Obviously we want to give our customers the most choice that we possibly can.  We think we have a great lineup.  We have a lot of choices.  ", "On the shared side of the house, we are not seeing resistance on people converting to shared.  Actually, we\u2019re much ahead of what our expectations were.  We have 30% of our base now on shared.  And that continues to go up.  ", "Also, within the shared plan, we\u2019re seeing exactly what we thought would happen.  As people move to 4G, and you heard that 68% of our upgrades are to 4G, that\u2019s driving usage, which is also driving up the higher tiers, driving the revenue profile.  ", "And also, the connected devices.  As we said the last call, we see that when people come in as a new Verizon customer, their actual device attachment is much lower than our base, but over that 9 to 12 months, we see them attaching more devices and moving up to where the average of our overall base is. ", "So we continue to see that happening, and it\u2019s all about customer service as well, not just when an upgrade period is.  So I think we\u2019re hitting on all cylinders here, but we have to watch this carefully.  ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura.  Your line is open.  ", "Mike McCormack - Nomura", "Just wanted to circle back on the upgrade policy and your thoughts as the year progresses.  There\u2019s been a view that we should have some of your competitors getting a little bit healthier towards the back half of the year.  Does that set up to be another differentiator for those other carriers?  ", "And then secondly, on the upgrade policy changes, is there a risk, as the customer matures past the 20 months, that the ETF is low enough that it could create unnecessary churn for you guys?  ", "And then lastly, just thinking about data usage, and obviously it\u2019s an important thing for RPU revenue growth, how much of that, if you can measure it, is being offloaded onto the wifi network onto the wireline data side, to maybe either try to save data usage on the wireless side or to get a better customer experience?  ", "Fran Shammo ", "On the upgrade policy, obviously these decisions from us are done based on a lot of customer input and customer feedback and focus groups.  So we don\u2019t just jump into these things.  You saw us do that when we implemented the $30 upgrade fee.  So we\u2019re very diligent in how we do this.  As far as customer contracts and ETFs, we\u2019ve managed this since we started with service agreements and 24 months.  ", "So this is nothing new, and look, I think we compete on a number of fronts.  It\u2019s not just on a service contract or pricing.  We compete on our outstanding network.  So when you look at our network and reliability, the 4G network and our superiority, I think if you compare our network with others that you have to say we\u2019re the leader in the market as far as reach, as far as consistency of performance.  So when you go to connect that data session, it connects, you get the speed that we advertise on a consistent basis.  You look at the Share Everything plan, and the options we have there and the flexibility within that plan.  If you look at the number of our device lineups.  ", "So all of this, including our great customer service from our customer service centers, this all goes into why our churn is the lowest in the industry, and will continue to be the lowest in the industry.  And this is what we work for every single day.  It\u2019s tackling the basics, as I said in my opening comments.  So again, we manage all of this.  ", "As far as data and offload to wifi, obviously customers offload to wifi, but what we see is, again, because of the superiority of our network, and because of the authentication that our network has, we actually want people to offload when they\u2019re in their homes, but when they\u2019re out in public areas, they want to stay on our network, because it is authenticated, it is secure, and a lot of wifi networks outside the home are not secure.  So I think that plays into that as well.  But we do think that wifi is a good offload in certain circumstances, but not all.  ", "Mike McCormack - Nomura ", "Just quickly on cost of service and wireless, it had a meaningful step down, which obviously is a credit to your cost savings opportunities.  How should we look at that progressing through the year?", "Fran Shammo ", "Well, I think that all hinges on the upgrade, right?  So when we came into this year, I said that our upgrades would be flat with a year ago.  So it\u2019s obviously sequentially.  I think that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking at.  It is a considerable decrease, because of the volume that we had in the fourth quarter versus the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank.  Your line is open.  ", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "", "You noted the importance of keeping a close eye on the level of subsidies that you incur, and that\u2019s why you made further adjustments to the upgrade policies.  So if we look at the policies now, people have to keep their phone for the duration of their contract.  They have an upgrade fee.  It seems like you\u2019ve done just about everything you can do from a policy standpoint to keep subsidies in line.  ", "Are there any other steps you can take as a carrier to work on that even further?  For example, are you rethinking whether you should be favoring lower subsidized phones in the stores?  Or is there even anything you can do to influence the actual cost of manufacturing a phone, so that it\u2019s lower for you?  ", "Fran Shammo ", "So around this, again, I go back to, if you look at the history of basic phones and what happened over time, again I think the smartphone category will also follow this, where, as the competition and innovation, as new phones come to market - obviously Blackberry is coming back into the market, we have the Windows phone - so as more ecosystem comes here and more competition happens, the cost of these phones will eventually start to decrease.  ", "And we\u2019ve already seen some of this competition happen in certain categories, with the decrease of smartphones.  We\u2019ve launched smartphones in prepaid.  That gives you an indication that there\u2019s some low end smartphones out there, because we really don\u2019t subsidize much on the prepaid product.  ", "So again, as the ecosystem builds, I think this will follow what historically the basic phone did over the last 10 years that that was maturing.  And that\u2019s what\u2019s going to impact the lower subsidies over time.  And of course then, as I\u2019ve said in the past, as we move into our 4G and our VoLTE launch, which we\u2019ll start to have VoLTE capable phones, we think, by the end of this year.  We\u2019ll commercially launch early next year.  ", "And as we do that, and our footprint of 4G LTE really covers that of the 3G network and the experiences there, then we\u2019ll start to take the CDMA chip out of those handsets.  So again, that will impact subsidy going forward.  So I think we have a good roadmap here that says our strategy, we believe that we can start to reduce subsidy over a length of two to three years.  So I think that\u2019s what our position is.  ", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank ", "And was there any experience that you had with feature phones where you found that you had the ability to push the ecosystem?  In other words, do you think there\u2019s any opportunity to start driving customers towards smartphones that already have lower subsidies?  Or do you really have to wait for the market to want those devices?", "Fran Shammo ", "I think this goes back to customer satisfaction, and as I said before, we don\u2019t incent our front lines to sell one phone over another.  This is a customer choice.  Because again, the worst thing that can happen to us is force a phone into a customer\u2019s hands and within our return policy of 14 days worry free, they can come back and return that phone for dissatisfaction for any reason.  And we give them a new phone.  That is not a good financial model.  ", "So we want the customer, when they walk out the door, to have the right phone in their hand, whatever phone they choose, and to make sure that they\u2019re educated to use that phone.  So that\u2019s what\u2019s more important to us, instead of locking them into a low subsidy handset that they\u2019re going to be dissatisfied with.  ", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank ", "And just a point of clarification, because you mentioned about eventually taking CDMA chips out of devices, what is the commitment to CDMA?  And what would be the timeframe for getting there?", "Fran Shammo ", "I think that\u2019s going to come into play in \u201914, so we\u2019ll keep you posted on that.  But the strategy is to eventually, within these 4G LTE devices, to remove that chip at some point in time.  So I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank ", "So we see our first device, that doesn\u2019t necessarily have the CDMA chip, next year?  Not all devices?", "Fran Shammo ", "That\u2019s correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America.  Your line is open.", "David Barden \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "First, it\u2019s probably going to become clear, I think, through the quarter, that you guys took another healthy chunk of the wireless market share for net add growth.  Can you talk a little bit about, as we think about the year unfolding, where this net add growth is coming from in terms of tablets, home zone, the share that you\u2019re winning from the iDEN network shutdown over at Sprint, just so we can kind of think about how the market is unfolding and where the competitive tangent points are?  ", "And then I guess second, on the cash flow front, it looks like you guys didn\u2019t actually pay taxes this quarter, which was a big tailwind for that number.  Can you give us a little bit more color about how you think that cash tax line is going to contribute or not to the cash flow picture for the rest of the year?", "Fran Shammo ", "First, on the all categories growth, as I said in my prepared remarks, last year when we came into the first quarter I said that we would look at continuing to accelerate our growth through the year, and I think we\u2019re on plan to do that again this year.  ", "As far as the mix of growth here, it\u2019s really evenly spread among all devices.  So we had net gains in smartphone customers, we had net gains in our home phone connect product.  We had net gains in fusion, tablets, internet devices, prepay.  So it\u2019s across the gamut that we are driving on every single device.  So it\u2019s not one device over another, but we think that we will continue to grow each individual category on a net positive basis.  ", "As far as cash flow goes, there\u2019s all kinds of things that happen in cash taxes during the quarter.  We pay a lot of property tax, a lot of sales tax.  There is a federal estimated tax that\u2019s in the first quarter.  So again, I think that\u2019s included in maybe some separate line items that you\u2019re not seeing.  But we did make some cash tax payments in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo.  Your line is open.  ", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "I just wanted to ask on spectrum, it was recently reported that the DOJ supports restricting the purchase of broadcast spectrum by limiting those current holders of low band spectrum such as yourself.  There isn\u2019t a lot of spectrum, in my view, coming over the next two years.  You\u2019re clearly in a good position with AWS, but how do you handle spectrum needs, and how will this impact your capex or small cell deployments going forward.", "Fran Shammo ", "I think it\u2019s an important question, so let\u2019s just back up a second.  So the FCC, right now, is targeting 2014 for the auctions, and is working to develop the rules around the auction process.  Obviously we\u2019re working very closely with the FCC and the broadcasters and others in the industry to develop the rules around these auctions and make them successful.  ", "Really our basis is we want to ensure that the FCC develops and implements the auctions in a way that allows Verizon Wireless to bid for and acquire the additional spectrum that it needs to run its business.  ", "As you know, the FCC, they need to maximize the amount of spectrum available for mobile broadband services and ensure the auction is designed to encourage the broadcasters themselves to participate.  These rules that restrict companies from bidding and give other companies priority could actually cause the auction to fail.  ", "So as you know, the DOJ recently this week weighed in on a theoretical concern about the market foreclosure.  We believe the concern is really around some who buy the spectrum to keep others from buying the spectrum, and I think if you look at history, that has not shown itself.  Verizon has never purchased spectrum for that reason.  We buy it to use it, and I think our track record is we really efficiently use the spectrum that we have.  ", "And I think the secondary market is another important one here, because we\u2019ve proved that the secondary market worked in 2012 by divesting some of the spectrum that we felt others could use more appropriately than we could.  So I think this all goes into that, but I think that\u2019s our view around the DOJ, and we will work closely with the FCC in order to make that spectrum available for the people who need it.", "So as far as capex and utilizing what we need, obviously we\u2019re in a very good position with spectrum, and as I said before, when spectrum comes up, whether it\u2019s in an auction or for sale on the open market, you have to be opportunistic, because it normally only comes up at one time, and we\u2019re very selective on what we go after.  But we have a very long term strategy with spectrum, and we\u2019ll be opportunistic if the climate presents itself.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Seitz of Jefferies.  Your line is open.  ", "Tom Seitz - Jefferies", "A couple of question related to the copper fiber migration.  First, it looks like you\u2019re a little bit ahead of plan.  Is that just a function of fixing Sandy issues immediately or do you think you can keep or even accelerate this pace?  Second, you disclosed I think 83,000 forced conversions.  Can you give us some idea of how many took just the voice product versus how many stepped up?  ", "Fran Shammo ", "Just a couple of things here.  Around the copper to fiber migration, obviously with this one we did have very, very good process this quarter in converting these migrations.  And some of this obviously had to do with some of the Sandy impact.  I would also tell you, though, that this is really a technology change, and we need to really move to the new technologies.  ", "From a regulatory standpoint, if you look at it, the FCC has longstanding rules in place that permit copper retirement.  Now, I know some of the CLECs have urged the FCC to suspend or change these rules, but we need to encourage our customers and others to move to the new technologies in order to provide our customers with the best solutions that they have.  ", "And for many of our customers, that service is best delivered over fiber or even maybe a wireless network.  And in some of these situations, we\u2019re not going to rebuild the copper.  It doesn\u2019t make financial sense to lay fiber to some of these remote areas.  So wireless may be a better solution here, and we\u2019re working with the regulatory agencies on that.  ", "And within Pennsylvania, a year ago, we solved some of the internet provisioning via LTE, instead of fiber.  So I think the regulatory bodies are very open to it.  We continue to work with them.  ", "But as far as the copper to fiber migration for the first quarter, I think we\u2019re off to a great start, and 300,000 is our target.  That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t exceed that, but we will continue to migrate our customers to the new technology.  ", "As far as the breakdown between voice and internet, we really don\u2019t despair there, because what\u2019s happening is as we move people over to fiber, they\u2019re coming onto the Quantum product.  27% of our base now is on Quantum, and what we\u2019re seeing is they\u2019re buying up in the tiers, because once they get that 15-30 MB tier, and that\u2019s what\u2019s helping to drive the stellar revenue performance in the consumer market of 4.3%, which is the highest I think we\u2019ve ever had at this point, compared to some of the prior years, and consistent with what we performed in last year.  ", "So I think we\u2019re on a good path here to continue to produce solid wireline consumer revenue growth with our strategy that we laid out.   ", "Operator", "Our last question for today comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer.  Your line is open.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Around wireless, I had a few questions.  As part of moving to the 24-month cycle, I would assume there\u2019s a lot of variables to go with that, but it would seem to me that the shared data plans are helping that a lot.  And maybe can you talk a little bit about the data usage on those shared data plans, and the growth rate, or any other metrics you can provide?", "And then also, on the phones, it just seems like the phones are getting a lot better.  I know in my own family we used to break the phones after 12 months, and now they seem to be lasting a lot longer.  Was that part of the thinking?  ", "And just related to that, both personally and professionally, are you flexible at all in the 24-month upgrades?  Will you provide 20-month upgrades for high quality customers who are getting maybe a lower subsidy phone?  How rigid is that?  ", "Fran Shammo ", "On the 24-month cycle, obviously our policies are our policies, and obviously I\u2019ll let Verizon Wireless deal with any exceptions to those policies at the front line, because again, we want to make sure the customers are satisfied.  But the policy is the policy, and we want to make sure that the front line sticks to our policies.  But obviously, again, as you know, there\u2019s always an exception to the rule here and there.", "As far as really thinking this through, I think these are highly subsidized phones.  These are miniature computers walking around.  It really goes to, when you look at the demographics of the customers who upgrade, demographics play a big role in this.  I mean, the younger generation wants to update to the day.  Some others will hold their phones for three, even four years.  So it really is a vast difference, and we\u2019re just trying to conform everything to a consistent policy, so that it makes sense for the customer and it makes sense for us.", "As far as 4G LTE and data usage, as we\u2019ve said, 54% of our data now is going over the LTE network, so that should tell you something about the usage of our 4G LTE customers.  Beyond that, we\u2019re not going to disclose any individual statistics around data usage.

[Operator instructions.] It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, senior vice president, investor relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, operator. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our chief financial officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be available on our website later today.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our safe harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.", "Before Fran takes you through the details, I would like to make you aware of a non-operational item included in the quarterly results. For the second quarter, we reported earnings of $0.78 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include $147 million after tax, or $0.05, for the favorable effect of an interim actuarial remeasurement associated with one of our pension plans, due to settlement accounting.", "The noncash credits were due primarily to an increase in the discount rate assumption used to determine our current pension liability. On an adjusted basis, EPS was $0.73, compared with $0.64 a year ago.", "Our discussion of consolidated results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effect of the nonoperational gain. In addition, the quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone. Our strategic investments in 4G LTE, FiOS, global IP, and cloud services continue to drive strong operating performance. We are executing well in these key growth areas.", "Overall, consistent top line growth, along a strong focus on cost efficiency and profitably, resulted in double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share in the second quarter. In fact, we have posted double digit earnings growth in five of the last six quarters.", "Second quarter adjusted EPS was $0.73, up 14.1%. Year to date, adjusted earnings per share were $1.41, representing 14.6% growth. As you know, our strategy focus is on building networks and platforms as the foundation for innovation and growth.", "Underpinning our success is the consistent investment in these networks and platforms, which position us to take advantage of growth opportunities in the rapidly evolving wireless and wireline markets for broadband, video, and cloud services.", "Operationally, we are focused on increasing value by delivering products and services to customers in the most efficient and effective way possible. In wireless, our Share Everything plans are a great example. We have simplified decisions for customers, making it easy to add new devices and manage their shared data usage.", "Our FiOS Quantum offer, where customers can upgrade broadband speeds themselves, is another example of improving service quality and increasing operational efficiency. Throughout the entire business, there are many examples where Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles are being adopted, and we are realizing efficiency gains in a number of areas, including customer care, supply chain, and system support.", "As we move through the year, we are confident that successful execution in our key strategic areas will continue to drive incremental revenue and promote operating efficiency, resulting in sustainable growth in free cash flow and earnings.", "Let me shift now to our second quarter performance, hitting a few highlights. Our wireless results were strong, once again effectively balancing growth and profitability. We added 941,000 retail post-paid connections, up nearly 40% sequentially. Service revenue grew more than 8%, EBITDA growth was up double digits, and our EBITDA service margin was 49.8%, solidly within our annual margin guidance.", "We also had a strong quarter of customer and revenue growth in FiOS. Revenues were up nearly 15%, and we added 161,000 new subscribers in FiOS internet and 140,000 in FiOS video, roughly 20% more than we added in the second quarter last year.", "In global enterprise, strategic services revenue grew 4.8%. Our consistent operating performance, together with disciplined capital spending, is driving higher free cash flow. Through the first half of the year, free cash flow increased by more than 20%, resulting in an improving return on investment profile for the entire business.", "Now let\u2019s take a brief look at consolidated results, starting with slide four. Total operating revenue grew 4.3%, sustaining our solid top line growth performance. For the quarter, the increase in consolidated revenues, coupled with effective cost management, resulted in 11.8% growth in adjusted operating income.", "On an adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased to $10.5 billion, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 90 basis points to 35.1%. Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on slide five.", "We have emphasized that consistent investment in wireless drives our leadership in network quality, reliability, and the overall customer experience. Our commitment to 4G LTE covers a wide range of activities, including the securing of necessary spectrum, the allocation and deployment of capital for both coverage and capacity, our leadership in fostering a robust device and application ecosystem, and the success of our Share Everything plans in driving device adoption and stimulating usage.", "Once again, our second quarter wireless results demonstrate the effective execution of this strategy. Total wireless revenues grew to $20 billion, representing 67% of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. We sustained strong service revenue growth of 8.3%, making it the third consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 8%. EBITDA increased to $8.5 billion, and our EBITDA service margin expanded by 80 basis points year over year to 49.8%, representing another very strong quarter of growth and profitably.", "Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide six. Service revenue growth continues to be driven by increasing connections, smartphone penetration gains, and data usage. The simplicity and value proposition of our Share Everything plans is driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account.", "During the second quarter, retail post-paid service revenue per account, or RPA, grew 6.4% to $152.50 per month. We have 35 million post-paid accounts, and the average connection per account increased to 2.7, up 5.5%.", "Our Share Everything plans have been very successful. The plans have been available since June 28 of last year, and customer adoption has been very strong. In just one year, more than 36% of our post-paid accounts are on a Share Everything plan. The value proposition is simple and straightforward, and customers increasingly recognize the value of shared data across multiple devices.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide 7. As I highlighted earlier, we added 941,000 new retail post-paid connections, up from 677,000 in the first quarter, and about 6% higher than a year ago. We also added 97,000 retail prepaid connections, so our retail net connections totaled just over 1 million in the quarter.", "As I stated on our last earnings call, we expect to continue to see sequential quarterly net add improvement in 2013. Total retail connections topped the 100 million mark in the quarter. Our industry-leading post-paid base stood at 94.3 million, and we have more than 5.8 million prepaid connections.", "Our connections growth was driven by another strong quarter of gross additions. Postpaid gross adds of 3.6 million were up 14.2% year over year. The number of customer upgrades also increased by sequentially and year over year, with a postpaid upgrade rate of 7% for the quarter. We continue to expect that our annual upgrade rate will be about the same as last year. Our upgrades remain high quality, with 36% of customers purchasing a smartphone for the first time.", "We also maintained a high quality mix within our postpaid net adds. We added 472,000 in the phone category. Of this total, 974,000 were smartphones, with the balance representing the decline in basic phones. We added 371,000 internet devices, including tablets. The balance of just below 100,000 included Home Phone Connect, Home Fusion, and other connected devices.", "Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Retail postpaid churn was 0.93%. The sequential improvement was due primarily to an expected reduction in involuntary churn, as discussed coming out of the first quarter.", "Next, let\u2019s turn to slide eight and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations totaled 10.1 million in the quarter, representing both a sequential and year over year increase. We had a high quality device mix once again, with 88% of the activations being phones.", "Smartphone activations totaled 7.5 million, and 72% of them were 4G LTE. The smartphone mix was fairly balanced; roughly 51% of the activations were iPhones. Our smartphone penetration continued to improve, and we ended the quarter at over 64%. We had another strong quarter for internet devices. Activations of these devices, which include mobile hotspots, jet packs, and tablets, topped 1 million again this quarter.", "Adoption of 4G LTE smartphones and devices continued to accelerate. One-third of our retail postpaid connections are now 4G LTE, compared to just 12% one year ago. 46% of our smartphones, and more than two-thirds of our internet devices are 4G LTE. Currently, 59% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network, which is five times more efficient than the 3G network.", "In terms of geographic coverage, we now cover 500 U.S. markets with 4G LTE, and have essentially completed our buildout by matching our 3G footprint. Our LTE network covers more than 99% of our 3G footprint, and when you include our rural America partners, LTE is available to about 301 million across the nation.", "Throughout the rest of this year, we will continue to invest, adding capacity to our existing 4G coverage, ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices. I will cover our capital spending outlook in more detail during our discussion of cash flows.", "Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment, starting on slide nine. Our wireline investments and platforms, such as FiOS, global IP, security, cloud services, and machine-to-machine, enable us to deliver the services and leading-edge applications and solutions that customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient, and will help improve our cost structure in the long run.", "Total wireline revenues decreased 2% in the second quarter, as growth in FiOS and strategic services were offset by softer global enterprise and wholesale revenue from legacy transport services and CPE.", "In terms of wireline segment margin, second quarter EBITDA increased to $2.2 billion, and the margin was 22.2%, up 80 basis points sequentially. We continue to believe we can improve the wireline segment margin in 2014. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the revenue components, starting on slide 10.", "In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive signs, highlighted by sustained FiOS revenue growth. Consumer revenues grew 4.7%, driven by FiOS, which now represents 71% of consumer revenue. Our overall consumer monthly RPU increased 9.4% to more than $109, and we sustained a blended FiOS RPU at over $150 per month.", "Two-thirds of our FiOS customers are triple play, which have a higher amount of recurring revenue per month. As I highlighted earlier, we had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In terms of broadband, we had 161,000 new FiOS internet additions and now have 5.8 million subscribers, representing penetration of 39%.", "Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 45,000. In FiOS video, we added 140,000 new subscribers in the quarter, bringing our total to 5 million, which is over 34% penetration.", "In addition to the customer growth and increased penetration, we are also gaining traction with our FiOS Quantum offers for higher broadband speeds. Sales of our FiOS internet product, at speeds in excess of 50 MB per second, increased during the quarter, and existing customers continue to buy up in the speed. At the end of the quarter, one-third of FiOS internet customers subscribed to Quantum, with speeds ranging from 50 to 300 MB per second.", "We continue to make steady progress with copper migrations, increasing the number of service upgrades each quarter. During the second quarter, we converted more than 86,000 customers. Through the first half, our total was 169,000, so we are more than halfway to our target of 300,000 for the year.", "This network evolution initiative is important for us as we reduce our dependency on older technologies. Aside from the maintenance expense savings, and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional RPU over time.", "Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail residential connections declined by 5.2%, compared with a loss of 6.6% at this time last year. We expect that continued strength of FiOS, the copper migration initiative, and the benefits of labor contracts and work rule flexibility will have a positive effect on wireline profitably this year.", "Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next, on slide 11. In the second quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $184 million, or 4.8%. CPE sales, which were down 34% year over year, represented $162 million of the decrease. Excluding the decline in CPE, global enterprise revenue was down less than 1% on a year over year basis.", "Strategic services, which now comprise 57% of enterprise revenue, grew 4.8%. In the second quarter, the continued decline in legacy transport services more than offset the growth in strategic services.", "We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space. Many of our customers are focused on improving their cost structure, which can result in reduced services with us. In addition, many customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions.", "Moving next to global wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $141 million, or 7.7%, due primarily to continued declines in the transport services. Again, our strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next-generation Ethernet services.", "In terms of profitably, while growth in the enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of global enterprise and wholesale continue to put pressure on wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts, which we believe will improve our operating efficiency.", "Let\u2019s turn to slide 12 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation remained very strong. For the first half of this year, cash flows from operations increased by 12%. Free cash flow was up by more than 21%.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4 billion and were $7.6 billion year to date, up 2.5%. Wireless capital spending in the second quarter totaled $2.3 billion. Through the first half, wireless capex totaled $4.3 billion, 8.6% higher than last year.", "As I noted earlier, we have essentially completed our initial LTE buildout by matching our 3G footprint. Throughout the rest of the year, we will continue to invest by adding capacity to our existing coverage as we begin to deploy AWS spectrum throughout the network.", "In wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $2.9 billion year to date, which was down 5.9% from last year. Strong connections growth, driven by 4G LTE, and our Share Everything plans, has resulted in higher demand forecasts and a need for increased capital investment.", "As such, we are increasing our full year capital spending outlook from flat at $16.2 billion to between $16.4 billion and $16.6 billion. We remain focused on improving investment returns and capital efficiency, and we continue to expect our capex to revenue ratio for the full year to improve, even with the additional investments in 4G LTE.", "Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain very strong. Total debt at the end of the second quarter was just under $50 billion, and our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was about 1.2x. Let\u2019s summarize on slide 13.", "Our second quarter results showed consistently good performance in the key strategic growth areas, so at the halfway point, the key year to date financial and operating metrics are strong: consolidated revenue growth of 4.2%; operating income up 15.6%; adjusted earnings of $1.41 per share, representing 14.6% growth.", "In wireless, service revenue growth up a very strong 8.4%; average revenue per account up 6.7%; retail post-paid additions of 1.6 million, up 16.5%; EBITDA growth of 14%, and an EBITDA service margin of 50.1%. We are on track to deliver on our 49-50% margin guidance for the full year.", "In wireline, consumer revenue growth of 4.5%, driven by FiOS growth of nearly 15%, 349,000 subscribers in FiOS internet, and 309,000 in FiOS video. We are on track to meet our 600,000-plus FiOS customer growth target.", "Free cash flow generation is up better than 20% year over year, and our balance sheet remains very strong. All in all, a very good first half. We are now focused on continuing the momentum, which should result in a strong second half of the year.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Fran, thank you. Operator, we\u2019re now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick - JPMorgan ", "Two around wireless. First, you talked about sequential improvements in adds in the third and fourth quarter. Given that Sprint\u2019s not going to be seeding a number of items into the market, in what\u2019s traditionally not a strong third quarter, can you help us see why you\u2019re more confident there?", "And second, can you talk about how you expect margins to track through the remainder of this year? Given the upgrade comment you just made about being flat year over year, that\u2019s a little higher than I would have thought given the commentary, or the change for the fourth quarter. Can you just talk about those?", "Fran Shammo ", "On the sequential third and fourth quarter, it\u2019s similar to the trend that we saw last year when coming out of the first and second quarter. We said we would sequentially continue to see growth in the third and fourth quarter. And again, this is around what we expect the roadmap to be on additional device launches throughout the third and fourth quarter.", "But the momentum that we have, and you see that momentum coming out of second quarter, and I\u2019ll talk more to that in a second when we get to the margins, we continue to see this high-quality subscriber coming onto the wireless 4G LTE network, and we don\u2019t see that changing at this point.", "From a Sprint and porting ratio, I won\u2019t get into specific individual carriers, but again, pretty consistently positive with all carriers from a porting ratio perspective.", "On the margin side of the house, I think we have to put this in perspective. Again, we are fully engaged on the 49-50% guidance that I gave to you in the beginning of the year , and if you look at the first half of the year at 50.1% for the first half and coming out of this quarter at 49.8%.", "And I think you have to look at what\u2019s behind that. So if you look at, on a year over year basis, just between the quarters, we improved our profitably by 80 basis points. In that, if you look at that, we moved 7.5 million smartphones. 1.6 million of that was additional smartphones over last year. And then if you just look at the 4G devices, we moved 3.1 million more 4G devices this year than we did a year ago.", "And in that, if you look at the service revenue growth of 8.3%, that\u2019s up 100 basis points over where we were last year. So you can see the quality of these adds, and if you take what we added in the quarter of nets, with 472,000 net phone, it\u2019s a pretty good indication of what we\u2019re going to drive from a margin perspective.", "And then if you look at the network side of this, with 4G LTE, we now have 33% of our customers on that network, 36% of our customers on shared. We had a growth of 5.5% in the connected devices. And I\u2019ve said that our growth is really dependent on two things. Number one, the 4G LTE network, and as people move over there, the usage of stimulation drives them into higher tiers from a tier perspective on the shared plan.", "And then of course the second piece is, as they get on the shared plan, they start to connect all these additional devices. And you can see that with the continued momentum of our internet category and some other things that will be coming to market similar to what we did in the fourth quarter last year as for the camera.", "So, combination of all these. I am very confident that we will continue on the margin track that we set out at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs ", "Fran, there\u2019s been obviously some buzz around Verizon investing in Canada. Maybe you can help us in terms of where you see the opportunity. Is this tied into a roaming footprint? Is it tied to maybe serving your own enterprise customer base? Or is there sort of a consumer retail presence you might have in mind tied to this?", "And then second question, on FiOS, very good volumes in what\u2019s generally a seasonally weak quarter. You talked about the 600 plus, that it seems like you have the opportunity to maybe be meaningfully above that result. I\u2019m just wondering, does what you\u2019ve seen in Q2 give you the opportunity to maybe set the bar higher for the year?", "Fran Shammo ", "On Canada, again, let me emphasize this is really an exploratory exercise for us. As you all know, they\u2019ve delayed their spectrum auction until January.", "So, again, we continue to just look at this market. I think it\u2019s everything that you said that we\u2019re kind of looking at. If you look at the population of Canada, about 70% of that population is between Toronto and Quebec. That\u2019s adjacent to the Verizon Wireless properties. Again, if you look at the spectrum auction, it mirrors up exactly what we launched here in the United States on the 700 MHz contiguous footprint.", "So we\u2019re looking at all these, but obviously some of the cautions here are the regulatory environment, a foreign investor coming into the Canadian market and what does that mean? So again, cautiously looking at it. Not ready to make any announcements today. And we continue to explore and have discussions, but at this point it\u2019s just really an exploratory exercise.", "On the FiOS volumes, again we put a lot of effort around continuing the superiority of the FiOS product. Bobby and his team have done a great job in and around the FiOS Quantum offers and a lot of the stimulated growth that we see here is coming from the Quantum offers that we have, and upgrading those Quantum offers to the 50 and 70 MB per second services.", "So look, we set a target for 600,000. Obviously if we can exceed that target, we will. We\u2019re ahead of that target, but I will tell you that the third quarter, again, is always a seasonally challenging quarter for us from a move perspective. So let\u2019s continue on the track that we are, and if we can overdeliver, we will, but we\u2019ve set the target at 600,000.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.", "John Hodulik - UBS ", "Quick question on wireline and then wireless. First, on wireline, Fran, in your prepared remarks you mentioned a couple of issues driving wireline profitability, that you see some improvement. I just wanted to see if I could get a little clarification. Are you talking about the year over year trends for the whole year? Or just the second half? If you could just sort of fill in the blanks for us, that would be great.", "And then secondly, on the wireless capex increase, can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving that? Is it more 4G devices? Is it more usage per device? Or is it maybe the competitive environment and what you\u2019re seeing from other carriers? What\u2019s really driving the change there?", "Fran Shammo ", "So in wireline possibility, look, we set the bar that said our margin would be flat year over year. Going into obviously in the third and fourth quarters of last year, compared to what we think we can do this year, and coming out of the second quarter, I think in the back half I have to improve the profitability in order to continue to make that guidance that we set out at the beginning of the year that said we would be flat on a margin basis. So I think we\u2019re on course to do that, and mathematically, the profit has to get better in the back half of the year in order to sustain that guidance.", "As far as the capex on wireless goes, there\u2019s a couple of things here that are driving this. If you look at, over the last three quarters, the growth that we\u2019ve had, the number of 4G devices we\u2019ve moved, and if you look at just the first half of this year versus the first half of last year, we\u2019ve added 6.2 million more 4G devices on the 4G network than we had a year ago, from just an overall sale perspective.", "So when you look at that and you look at the usage, currently 59% of the data traffic is now running on the 4G network. And that\u2019s being driven by 33% of the base. So again, from just a growth perspective on the top line, we\u2019ve always said, again, that as customers move into shared, and they realize the viability and speeds, and the consistency of this 4G network, it\u2019s going to drive them to use higher usage. And if you look at where video\u2019s going in the future, obviously that\u2019s going to continue the proliferation of the usage on this network.", "And we look out two years ahead of where we think our curve is going to be, and given the past success we\u2019ve had, and the usage patterns, and the amount of 4G devices that we\u2019ve already moved, and the roadmap that we see coming, we need to accelerate really the capacity that we previously thought. And it\u2019s really all to drive what customers want.", "So the incremental investment will more than pay for itself on top line growth, from what I see. And again, this is really a shift in our capital discipline between wireline and wireless. And we\u2019re going to maintain our lead on the most reliable, consistent 4G LTE network. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the increase for the capex.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley ", "Other wireless service revenues were very strong, up about 20% year over year. I imagine you\u2019ve got some MBNOs and maybe roaming and other stuff. Perhaps you could just comment on the drivers of that and the sustainability of that.", "And then on the enterprise side, you talked about continued cautious behavior and cost focus. Do you see any signs of a second half pickup? I think there\u2019s some better news on unemployment and generally macro trends improving in the second half. Are you seeing any of that? Or is it pretty much static from your point of view?", "Fran Shammo ", "On the other wireless revenue, obviously what\u2019s included in that other wireless revenue is our reseller base. I don\u2019t like to refer to them as MBNOs. That\u2019s a bad word for me. But on the reseller base, it\u2019s really driven from the prepaid providers that we have on that side of the business.", "And again, coming out of this quarter, we did a fairly substantial number of net adds there. And again, our prepay strategy is between what we sell on the retail side under our own brand, and we had a positive quarter again this quarter, with 97,000 net adds.", "But we also drive the, if you want, the lower-end market through resellers, and mainly through the relationship with Walmart, through Tracfone. So that drives a lot of volume, and that has been good revenue growth for us.", "The other things I would tell you, though, is that in addition to that, obviously roaming is in there, machine-to-machine , which we don\u2019t really talk about much. We\u2019re gaining a lot of momentum around machine-to-machine, and that is driving incremental revenue, albeit very low individual unit per subscriber type revenues, but again, as we start to gain momentum and sell hundreds and hundreds of thousands of these types of devices, that\u2019s going to contribute to those revenues and contribute to the overall growth of wireless. So that\u2019s the component of that.", "On the enterprise side, look, I understand the unemployment is there, but it\u2019s not large enough and steady enough to give me confidence that something\u2019s going to turn here in the near future. And again, if you look at the enterprise space, mainly what everybody is focused on is cutting their costs.", "And obviously when we talk about cutting costs in enterprise, they come to us and figure out how they can reduce their spend with Verizon and have us give them solutions that help them reduce their spend. And of course we\u2019re happy to do that, but it does cause some top line pressure.", "And also, I think, again, the uncertainty of what\u2019s going on around the government sector, is twofold. Number one, a lot of this pressure in enterprise this quarter, if you look at the decline of 4.8%, over 60% of that was in the government sector for us this quarter. So there is a big impact from the sequestering activity and the pullback from both the state and local governments, and also within the federal government.", "As I look forward, though, the uncertainty around this tax situation, and if you think about it, we\u2019re now midway through the year, it\u2019s highly unlikely that we\u2019ll get tax reform this year. So again, we\u2019re faced with another cliff at the end of the year if congress does not extend the tax provisions that are currently on the books for another year.", "So hopefully they\u2019ll do that soon and put some of the uncertainty to rest, at least until the next 18 months, until we can get to all the difficult issues around tax reform, which as you know we have a lot of subgroups working in Washington to help and give suggestions on how to get this done. But that\u2019s going to take some time.", "Again, it\u2019s hard for companies to say we\u2019re going to invest in new technologies and new things, when we\u2019re not certain what the future of the tax laws hold for the books and records. So I still don\u2019t think anything\u2019s going to change drastically from where we are. And as I said before, at least from where I sit, the best we can hope for is a flat performance, and if you take CPE out of the equation this quarter, we\u2019re at a [0.8%] decline. So that\u2019s probably about where we\u2019ll be, zero to slightly decline, or slightly positive is kind of where I\u2019m at at this point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research ", "Could you just give us the update on the net debt calculation for Verizon Wireless? And then with respect to the business, I think the metrics that you threw out there on the LTE network implies about 1.8 more usage on the LTE network versus the 3G network. And I was wondering if you could expand on that a little bit more, and maybe give us a sense of what the usage trends are for your customers. And as they move into the shared data plans, if you could give us a sense of that kind of stimulus that you\u2019re seeing on the consumption front.", "Fran Shammo ", "On the update of the net debt for wireless growth, that is $10.1 billion, and net debt is $9.7 billion. And as you know, we did a distribution at the end of June of a total of $7 billion out of the partnership to both of the owners. And also, just to keep in focus here, we have about $1.5 billion of wireless debt coming due in the fourth quarter of this year and another approximately $3.5 billion coming due in the first quarter of next year, and we plan to pay that debt off at that point in time.", "On the LTE network, you\u2019re right on. Obviously what\u2019s happening is as people come from the 3G network over to the 4G network, you can see that incremental usage, whether it\u2019s a smartphone or a jet pack or a dongle. And as they start to share all this data, the video consumption is increasing year over year and quarter over quarter.", "Others in the industry have put out their projections of usage over the 4G data, if you look at some of the things that people have printed, and the escalation that the future holds from a data consumption standpoint as we start to move into more symmetry between in the home and out of the home content. We don\u2019t see that slowing, so again, yes, we do see an incredible jump when someone moves from 3G to 4G and the usage that they have on their smartphones and other devices. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike McCormack of Nomura. Your line is open.", "Mike McCormack - Nomura ", "Maybe just a comment on wireless margin. I know you\u2019ve got the sort of 49-50% expectation for the full year. Last year the fourth quarter had very high volumes that sort of really dragged down margins a bit. Are you getting comfort that the new upgrade policy should have a muting impact on that? And then just secondly, on FiOS competition, maybe just some comments regarding the triple play pricing environment out there, and also how well you\u2019re doing in the [MDU] market.", "Fran Shammo ", "On the wireless margins, obviously, again, we\u2019re very confident around the 49-50%. As far as the fourth quarter of last year, you have to keep in mind it was the first quarter that there was a free iPhone on the Verizon Wireless network, and we won\u2019t have that repeated this fourth quarter. Now, that\u2019s not to say that we don\u2019t see increasing volume. And again, I continue to say that we\u2019ll see incremental net adds through the third and into the fourth quarter.", "But from a margin perspective, if you look at just year over year and the amount of volume we\u2019ve moved, we actually ate through all that volume and improved the profitability of this business. And that goes into managing the entire business.", "So from an upgrade policy standpoint, some other things that we\u2019ll be launching. You probably saw Verizon Edge and some other options that we\u2019ll have on payment plans for our customers to acquire a smartphone. All of these things considered, we are very, very positive on the margin progress and the profitability progress of Verizon Wireless and the continued growth of Verizon Wireless.", "Mike McCormack - Nomura ", "Just on the Edge comment, is that something that you\u2019re hearing your customers actually demanding, the sort of equipment financing option?", "Fran Shammo ", "If you look back, we were the first carrier to launch LTE technology, we were the first ones to launch the shared pricing around LTE technology. We launched in the fourth quarter of last year an installment pay plan on tablets. That was something that our customers were asking for. We delivered that to them.", "And at that point in time, we started to look at it, and I said we were looking at other options for smartphones. We\u2019ve done a lot of focus groups in the last six months. We\u2019ve done a lot of market research. And yes, our customers are asking for another option.", "Twofold: Number one, we have a lot of customers on the technology edge that want to be able to upgrade sooner than they would under our historical legacy subsidy model, if you will. And we have other customers who quite honestly don\u2019t want to pay up front for the large cost of the phone. They\u2019d rather pay over time.", "So I\u2019m not going to get into all the details of Verizon Edge, I\u2019ll let Wireless do that, but that\u2019s something that our customers have been asking for, and I think we have a differentiated plan to launch to the market and Verizon Wireless will have more to say on that.", "Going back to your other question on triple play and MDU, obviously we continue to gain momentum here. Look, this business has always been competitive around the triple play, but I think what\u2019s differentiating us right now is the superiority of our product with fiber into the home.", "And as you get that fiber into the home, I think what customers are realizing, and we see this with the copper to fiber migration, when they move, and they see the speed that they can get on their internet capacity, we\u2019re seeing customers upgrade.", "And what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019re seeing our legacy copper customers, who we have migrated over to the FiOS network, they are paying between $10 and $15 more in RPU a month after about 60 days on our network, because they\u2019re upgrading freely into that 30 and 50 MB per second.", "So that\u2019s really what\u2019s differentiating us in the market. We will continue to advertise around that superiority, and I think that momentum will carry us into the third and fourth quarters.", "Mike McCormack - Nomura ", "Just a quick follow up on the FiOS side. Is there a point at which you guys are going to migrate to an all-IP video network?", "Fran Shammo ", "Obviously we\u2019ve already started that with the copper to fiber migration, but that\u2019s going to be quite some time in order to deactivate the copper switches and take all that plant and equipment out. We have the plans to do that, but that\u2019s not something that\u2019s going to be done within this year or next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo ", "I did want to ask about prepay. With AT&T doing [AIO] and now with Leap\u2019s purchase and Cricket in the fold, and T-Mobile and Sprint obviously having their own brands, is there any interest on your part in launching an independent prepay brand under Verizon, separate from Verizon?", "Fran Shammo ", "I think from a prepay perspective, we are very happy with how we approach this market, between our own prepaid product, which obviously you\u2019ve heard me talk about in the past, which is just strictly on our 3G network. We do not offer prepaid on the 4G LTE network.", "And as I said, we will become more aggressive over time in the prepaid market on that 3G network. Because again, as we look at the 3G versus the 4G, and we move 3G customers into our 4G network, we want to make sure that we keep that 3G network as full as possible, because when you think from an investment return, we\u2019re not investing any more in that network, and the fuller we can keep that network without detrimenting the service, the contribution margin of that network is very, very high.", "So prepaid is really the pillar of how we will continue to utilize that 3G network, so you\u2019ll see us become more aggressive around that when we need to be. You saw us change some pricing in the last two quarters around prepaid, and that has stimulated some growth for us.", "And then as I said previously, our other path is through resellers for the lower end market. I don\u2019t see the need, at this point, to do a secondary brand around the Verizon Wireless network. We have built our brand around the quality, the reliability, a superior network. I don\u2019t think that a secondary brand helps our overall brand at that point.", "The other thing I\u2019ll say is I\u2019m not going to comment on anything around the AT&T deal with Leap, but I will put to bed the rumors out there that Verizon Wireless may be interested in that asset. And [hear me], we\u2019re not interested in that asset.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank ", "I\u2019m not going to ask you about Leap, but that deal is spectrum-driven, and you guys have indicated that you\u2019re starting to deploy your AWS-1 spectrum, and maybe that\u2019s happening a little sooner than we thought, although you\u2019re seeing network traffic ramp very quickly.", "I\u2019m just curious if you can maybe give us a status update on your spectrum portfolio. Do you still feel like you have sufficient spectrum to get to the next auction? Do you still see an opportunity to buy spectrum in the market right now from other carriers? And have you started to think about maybe some supplemental solutions, for example maybe revisiting wifi, as another way to put capacity into your network?", "Fran Shammo ", "Around spectrum, we did our AWS deal last year, and that put us in a very good spot for our 4G LTE strategy. We started to launch AWS last year. We started to preposition that. We are accelerating the positioning of the AWS based on my comments before around the usage around wireless. But again, we are very comfortable with our spectrum holdings, and we are in good shape for three to four years.", "Obviously we will participate in the auction with the FCC targeted for 2014 around the broadcast licenses. That\u2019s something that we will participate in. But we are not under any spectrum pressure.", "If you look at our frequencies, and the way we deployed our CDMA spectrum, we can actually take very small slivers out of that CDMA spectrum and reallocate that to our 4G LTE spectrum on a needed basis. And that\u2019s where we get into this balancing act between the 3G network and the 4G network.", "But we are very satisfied with our holdings for the next three to four years. Obviously we\u2019re always opportunistic in spectrum acquisition, and we do actually buy spectrum every quarter. You probably don\u2019t see it, because we do little markets here and there.", "But look, we\u2019re always opportunistic, but at this point, we\u2019re satisfied, and there\u2019s nothing out there at this point other than the auction that we\u2019re concentrating on.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank ", "And on wifi, anything new there maybe involving your cable partners?", "Fran Shammo ", "From a wifi perspective, obviously we always like people to offload when they\u2019re in their home on a secured wifi network. You\u2019ve heard me talk before about wifi networks are not secure in the public domain. They have a purpose for us in certain instances around major sporting events and so forth, but our customers are very concerned about their privacy and security. That\u2019s why they ride the LTE network as much as they do.", "But we do want offload in certain circumstances, and so that does relieve some of the spectrum. We obviously, just from a utilization standpoint, for people that are in their homes, it\u2019s not good and efficient to run off the LTE network. They should shift over to their wifi network in their house. So we do encourage that, but again, not major, massive, public wifi is interesting for our customers, at least at this point in time, from a security standpoint.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "Just following up a little bit on that, Fran, I was wondering if you could give us a status update on the activities and development that\u2019s going on inside that joint innovation entity with the Comcast group, and what progress, if any, is being made on some of the digital content rights stuff?", "And then I guess second would be kind of along those lines. Could you elaborate a little bit on your relationship with NFL, and kind of some of the strategy behind that content relationship and if that\u2019s the beginning of a series of potential new moves to acquire content?", "And if I could, just one quick last one, I noticed the strategic services sales and enterprise were a a little over 6% growth year over year last quarter. They kind of slowed down into the 4% zipcode this quarter. I know overall enterprise has been fairly soft, but strategic services has been kind of a core strength. If you could kind of address that slowdown, it would be helpful.", "Fran Shammo ", "Around our joint venture with the cable companies, obviously our [unintelligible] solutions team has been working and defining consumers as to what they want both in the home and outside the home.", "And obviously what we\u2019re learning is the 4G LTE network plays a very critical role in that. We continue to work with them. We have expanded into 968 Verizon Wireless stores across the U.S., and we have about 2,500 indirect locations, the marketing material, and we continue to showcase these types of products.", "But I will say that as we continue to work through this, it\u2019s hard for Verizon Wireless to sell a cable product outside of the FiOS footprint, because it\u2019s new. And it\u2019s hard for the cable companies to sell a wireless product outside the footprint, because of the distribution channels. So as we continue to work through this, we\u2019re gaining some momentum here.", "But I think the one last point from all this is we\u2019re obviously very focused on the content rights. And you come into the NFL agreement, and the NFL agreement we think is just a new way of how content rights can be delivered into the wireless segment. And obviously our strategy is around both type of multicasting a live sporting event, and you saw our comments that the 2014 Super Bowl will be a multicast type event to our wireless customers.", "So that\u2019s really the breakdown of the wall between what can be delivered in the home and out of the home. And obviously we now have the rights to take some of the NFL live games out of the home and deliver them on the mobile devices.", "From a content standpoint, this has to develop, obviously, over time. The other point here around content is we are starting to see where we\u2019re getting inquiries from content providers that they may want to pay for their content rather than having the consumer pay. Those models are still being worked, but we\u2019ll see where that goes. But I look at that as the old 1-800 number, where the actual vendor pays for the usage, and not the customer. So we\u2019ll see how that strategy develops over the course of time.", "As far as our strategic services go, we continue to have good momentum in our strat services as we refine exactly what we\u2019re doing. We have very good momentum in the Terremark and the Hughes platforms, and around our cloud services.", "The slowdown, quite honestly, has been around our PIP exercise, and that is growing, but it\u2019s more a price compression within the industry. So we\u2019re facing some of that going forward. And we knew we were going to face some price compression around PIP, and we have to accelerate on the other strategic services to outpace that.", "So, other than that, we have good momentum on strat services.", "David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "And just to clarify, PIP is?", "Fran Shammo ", "IP-based solutions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tom Seitz of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Tom Seitz - Jefferies ", "Can you just give us an update on your expectations for VoLTE?", "Fran Shammo ", "We\u2019re still on course for VoLTE. We will start testing and have our first handset in the market at the end of the year. And then we will probably commercial launch sometime next year. But again, as I\u2019ve said in the past, the critical piece for us is that we have to make sure that our 4G LTE coverage footprint from a VoLTE standpoint equates to our 3G footprint, because the VoLTE call is not backwards compatible with the CDMA network. So when you establish a call on VoLTE, within our network, if you move outside of the LTE network, you will have a hard drop on that call. And obviously that\u2019s not something that our customers would expect from a premium provider like Verizon Wireless.", "So we\u2019re taking our time here. We will thoroughly test this. But we are on track to commercially launch sometime in the first half of next year. And then taking that out, as I\u2019ve said, at the end of next year, we are on track to have our first only LTE handset to be able to provide to the marketplace as well. So we\u2019re still on track with our VoLTE strategy, but it is a critical one for us to make sure that we get right when we launch.", "Tom Seitz - Jefferies ", "So the implication, though, then, is that the 4G network is going to be essentially everywhere that the 3G network is by sometime in the first half of next year?", "Fran Shammo ", "The 4G network is everywhere. As I said in my opening remarks, 99% of the coverage of our 4G network is equivalent to our 3G network. But now we have to go back in and fill in that capacity to make sure that from a voice call perspective, it will hand off, because voice is different than the data piece. So we just have to make sure that a customer who is on 3G today, when they go to VoLTE, they would see no difference in their service from 3G to 4G.", "Tom Seitz - Jefferies ", "Could I just follow up on Dave\u2019s question? There were press reports that ESPN was considering subsidizing mobile video consumption. And you sort of alluded to that as well. How soon do you think we\u2019ll see a material third party payer model? Is it this year? Is it next? Is it a couple of years out? Can you just sort of frame the timeframe of what you\u2019re thinking about?", "Fran Shammo ", "I think the big barrier right now is how does the content provider get the value of how many people watch their content on a mobile device to be able to go back to their advertisers in order to monetize that content? And right now that\u2019s where the barrier is, and we\u2019re working on that. But until that get solved, I think this model will be slow at this point in time.", "Now, slow to come, I\u2019m thinking maybe next year. But it\u2019s certainly not any time in this year that that model will break through. Because they have to recognize the benefit back to their advertisers to be able to monetize that content into our network.", "But it is something that\u2019s being discussed. They realize that the linear model will not work as it does in TV in the wireless market. You can\u2019t assume that someone\u2019s going to pay $8 a sub on 100 million subs, so that model does not work. So we are looking at other models, but the barrier is how do you measure everything to get back to the advertisers for the perceived value on that content?", "Operator", "Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays", "Just on the capital expenditure front, on the back of this capital expenditure rise for the year, I wanted to ask how we should think about the capital intensity of the business going forward. It does seem as though your competitors are healthily ramping their efforts to try and improve service quality. Do you feel as though you\u2019ll need to continue to put your foot on the gas in order to maintain the quality of your network?", "Fran Shammo ", "Well, let\u2019s put this in perspective. We\u2019ve moved our consensus by $200 million to $400 million, so this is not a huge step up in our capital spend. We just wanted to make sure everybody realized that we were going to accelerate some of the 4G LTE.", "But as we\u2019ve said in the past, and if you look at our results through the first half of the year, we continue to really be disciplined around the capital investment across our businesses, but also within the wireline segments. So you see that come down year over year. We expect that trend to continue. So that will offset some of the pressure that we may see on the wireless side.", "So I don\u2019t anticipate that there\u2019s going to be any major accelerations, but again, it\u2019s too soon to tell where we\u2019re going to come out in \u201913. I\u2019ll talk more about that in the coming quarters, but right now the focus is on this year and it\u2019s between $200 million and $400 million increment.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays ", "If I may, we\u2019ve clearly seen a pickup in terms of your shared data plans. I think you mentioned that it\u2019s more than 36% of your subscribers that are on these plans. I was thinking from a strategic perspective, as we\u2019ve seen increased promotional activities by some of your competitors to try and wean subscribers onto their networks, do you feel as though this is a potential mode in terms of protecting your subscriber base from some of these more aggressive pricing plans that are available in the market? Should we expect to see more promotional activity to try and ratchet this sort of percent of subscribers on shared data plans up in the coming quarters?", "Fran Shammo ", "This industry has always been an extremely competitive industry, and obviously some of the promotions around unlimited have been there for the last year, when we launched share pricing. And we continue to take market share, we continue to grow our revenue very strongly.", "So look, I mean, Verizon Wireless will do one thing very well. They will compete very well in the market, but we are a balanced company. We will compete, grow revenue, grow profitability, and grow our subscribers.", "And at the end of the day, customers make choices not really just on price, but the quality of the network, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve built our brand on. So quality of the network, consistency of the network, the reliability of the network, the value that we provide to our customers through these shared plans.", "And again, will we do promos here and there? Of course. As I said before, we\u2019ll launch the Verizon Edge, which will give our customers yet another choice of how do they want to enter onto the best network there. So I think the key here is give our customers choice, and continue with what we\u2019ve built our company on, which is the strongest network.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer ", "Two questions on wireless. Fran, you talked about the fact that your LTE network is enabling you to attract a higher quality customer, which has clearly been the case for a long time with your network. But do you have any evidence on that on maybe credit scores? Are you finding with what you\u2019ve done on LTE and the shared data plans, are you attracting higher credit quality scores, maybe losing lower quality score customers?", "And then secondly, on the shared data plans, can you maybe talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of customers needing to increase their data buckets or many customers bumping up against headroom? Or do you expect to see an acceleration of that in the next year? Or is it more like two to three years out?", "Fran Shammo ", "On the high quality, obviously we give a lot of our customers choice of various price plans and how to enter into our superior network. And of course credit scores have always been a component of that. I won\u2019t really get into how we differentiate the credit scores, but obviously you can see that from the growth that we have and the revenue growth that we have, this is not a major issue for us. And we watch this very closely, but we\u2019re gaining customers across all aspects of the business, let\u2019s just put it that way.", "Shared data plan, as far as acceleration of data usage, again, what we see, and if you\u2019ve experienced this yourselves, we continually communicate with our customers throughout the month as to when they get to their usage, and then when they get up into that 90%, we give them the ability to upgrade through their phone to the next tier.", "And we see some very good results from that. Customers are upgrading when they need to. So, again, based on our trajectory of data usage, especially with where we see video going, we continue to see that the uptake in the shared plan will continue, the usage will continue to accelerate, and our revenue growth will be reflective of that.", "Michael Stefanski", "That\u2019s all the time we have for questions. But before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Fran for some closing comments.", "Fran Shammo ", "Thanks, Mike. I just want to leave just a couple points of emphasis here. Our strategic investments and operational execution drove strong financial performance in the first half of this year. But while we are pleased with the overall performance, we obviously know we have more work to do.", "We are committed to driving shareholder value by continuing to execute our strategy and improve on the fundamentals of the business. We are focused on delivering superior customer service and providing the best portfolio of products, along with the most reliable and consistent performing network. Our focus is to capture incremental revenue growth in our key strategic areas while we also transform our service delivery and cost structure.", "As always, we will continue to be very disciplined around our capital investments, investing in those platforms for the innovation and the growth of the future. Through this strategy and execution model, we expect to drive incremental cash flow and earnings growth, both in the second half of this year and into the future.", "Thank you again for joining us, and everybody have a great day.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

(NYSE:VZ) Q3 2013 Earnings Conference Call October 17, 2013  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Michael Stefanski - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations", "Fran Shammo - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Analysts", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Philip Cusick - JPMorgan", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "David Barden - Bank of America", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions). Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website later today.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement and our other legends on slides two and three. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.", "Before Fran takes your through the details of our results, I would like to cover a few special items that are included in our reported results. These are displayed on slide four. For the third quarter, we reported earnings of $0.78 per share on a GAAP basis. These results include a net gain on the sale of 700 B block spectrum of $0.02 per share, offset by net incremental interest expense of $0.01 per share related to the debt we have raised to finance the acquisition of the remaining 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. We have accounted for the gain on the spectrum sale at the corporate level. So it is completely excluded from Wireless segment results.", "Excluding these non-operational effects, adjusted earnings per share was $0.77 in the third quarter compared with $0.64 a year ago. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share was $2.18 compared with $1.87 last year. Our discussion of operating results and growth rates in this presentation exclude the effects of these two items and they are not part of our segment results. Finally the quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. In the third quarter, our key strategic networks and platforms, Wireless 4G LTE, FiOS and enterprise strategic services drove very strong operating performance and financial results. Our consolidated revenue growth rate increased once again and our focus on cost efficiency and improved profitability resulted in double-digit growth in both, operating income and earnings per share, which we have delivered in every quarter this year.", "Third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 was up 20.3%. Year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of $2.18, represents 16.6% growth.", "In Wireless, we had another very strong quarter of growth and profitability. We posted sequential quarterly improvement in terms of new retail connections and smartphones. Total retail net adds were 1.1 million, which included 927,000 high-quality postpaid net adds.", "Service revenue growth increased to 8.4%. EBITDA increased 10.7% and our EBITDA service margin was 51.1%. All of this was accomplished with 7.6 million smartphone activations this quarter, which was up sequentially and 12.5% higher than last year.", "Our Wireline results in the third quarter also showed improvement. Consumer revenue increased 4.3% driven by FiOS penetration. Enterprise Strategic Services revenue grew 5.2%. Total Wireline segment EBITDA increased 3.8% and EBITDA margin improved to 22.7%, up 50 basis points, sequentially, and 100 basis points year-over-year.", "Our strong operating performance and disciplined capital spending is driving growth in free cash flow. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow increased $3.1 billion to $16.6 billion, an increase of more than 23%. All-in-all, we had a great third quarter capped off by a lot of activity since Labor Day.", "We announced an agreement with Vodafone to acquire its 45% interest in Verizon Wireless. The transaction will be accretive to earnings per share, provide additional operating cash flows and enable greater flexibility to develop converged solutions without any integration and due diligence risks.", "The capital market environment was strong and we had a fully executed Bridge facility in place at the date of the announcement. We successfully arranged in one day, the required permanent bond financing with a $49 billion debt offering. Earlier this month, we signed an agreement for up to $12 billion in term loans.", "Last week, we filed a Form S-4 Registration statement and our proxy statement with the SEC, related to the pending transaction. Lastly, in a demonstration of their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend increase for the seventh consecutive year, so we have been busy and productive on the transaction front, but as always our primary focus is driving strong operating results.", "Now let's look at our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenue grew 4.4%, continuing our solid top line growth trend. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 4%. The increase in consolidated revenues along with effective cost management, resulted in 16.8% growth in adjusted operating income in the quarter.", "On the same adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased to $11 billion, up 9.7%. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 170 basis points to 36.3%, which is the highest consolidated margins in more than five years.", "Now, let's move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. We will continue to build on our network advantage in 4G LTE by deploying capital to provide additional capacity and density to our network. We will also be opportunistic in terms of acquiring new spectrum. In short, we will continue to focus on executing our game plan.", "Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate our ability to create strong operating momentum and deliver excellent results. We continue to perform extremely well in a highly competitive market. Total Wireless revenues grew to $20.4 billion in the quarter, representing 67% of Verizon's consolidated revenue. We sustained our strong service revenue performance with 8.4% growth our fourth consecutive quarter of growth in excess of 8%.", "EBITDA increased to $8.9 billion and our EBITDA service margin expanded by 110 basis points to 51.1%. Year-to-date, our EBITDA service margin is 50.4%. Our Wireless profitability has been very consistent with margins of 49% or higher in five of the last six quarters.", "Let's now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on slide eight. Service revenue growth continued to be driven by increasing connections, data usage and smartphone penetration gain. Our Share Everything plans are driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage, resulting in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account. During the third quarter retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 7.1% to nearly $156 per month. We have 35 million postpaid accounts and average connections increased to 2.72 per account, up 4.6%.", "Customer adoption of our Share Everything plans have been exceptional. In just 15 months, 42% of our postpaid accounts are on these plans. The value proposition is simple and straightforward. Our customers quickly recognize the value of shared data across multiple devices, particularly in our 4G LTE environment.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide nine. In the third quarter, retail net additions increased by 1.1 million, up 2.2% sequentially. As I highlighted earlier, we had 927,000 postpaid net adds. In terms of the makeup of these postpaid net adds, we added more than 1 million smartphones which was a 5% sequential increase. Including the decline in basic phones, total phone net adds were 481,000. We added 370,000 new Internet devices including tablets. The remaining net adds of about 76,000 were primarily Home Phone Connect.", "We did encounter iPhone supply constraints that created a backlog at the end of September which resulted in some carryover to the fourth quarter. Within prepaid, we added 134,000 new retail connections which was 38% higher than the second quarter. We ended the quarter with 101.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base reached 95.2 million with the balance being prepaid.", "We maintained a high quality mix within our retail connections growth. Postpaid gross additions increased sequentially to 3.7 million. 73% of these gross adds were phones, including 2.2 million smartphones, both of which were higher than first or second quarter. The number of customer upgrades in the quarter remained fairly steady on a sequential basis, with a postpaid upgrade rate of 6.9%. The upgrade rate was also slightly affected by inventory constraints.", "As you would expect, a significant percentage of our upgrades are smartphones which continued to benefit us from a service revenue perspective. About 33% of customers upgrading to smartphones this quarter were purchasing one for the first time. A majority of the remaining upgrades were moving from a 3G to a 4G smartphone which we are able to monetize through higher data usage and lower cost to serve. And while upgrades are likely to be higher in the fourth quarter we continue to expect that our annual upgrade rate will be about the same as last year. Our churn metrics continue to be market-leading. Our retail postpaid churn was 0.97%.", "Next let's turn to slide 10 and take a look at device sales and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations, which includes both gross adds and upgrades, totaled 10.2 million in the quarter representing both a sequential and year-over-year increase. Similar to first and second quarter, 88% of the activations were phones. Smartphone activations totaled 7.6 million and 77% of these were 4G LTE. The smartphone mix was fairly balanced once again, with roughly 51% of the activations being iPhones. Our smartphone penetration continues to improve and we ended the quarter at over 67%. We also had another strong quarter of Internet device activations, which topped $1 million again in the quarter, 4G device penetration within our postpaid base continued at a rapid pace, 38% of our retail postpaid connections are now 4G, up from 33% in the second quarter and 17% one year ago.", "More than 50% of our smartphones and 70% of our Internet devices are 4G. Currently, about 64% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. Throughout the rest of this year, we will continue to add capacity and optimize our 4G LTE network, ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices.", "Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting on Slide 11. Our Wireline investments in platforms such as FiOS, global IP, security, cloud services and machine-to-machine enabled us to deliver the services, applications and solutions that our customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient and will improve our overall cost structure.", "In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive revenue trends highlighted by sustained FiOS growth. For the last five quarters, consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the third quarter, revenues were up 4.3%, driven of course by FiOS, which now represents about 72% of consumer revenue.", "Our overall consumer monthly ARPU increased to nearly $113, up 8.7%, roughly two-thirds of our FiOS customers are triple-play, which have a much higher amount of recurring revenue per month. We had a good quarter of FiOS customer growth. In terms of broadband, we had 173,000 new FiOS Internet editions and now have 5.9 million subscribers, representing 39% penetration.", "Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 56,000. In addition to the customer growth and increased penetration, we are also gaining traction with our FiOS Quantum offers for higher broadband speeds. More than half of our FiOS Internet sales in the quarter were at speeds in excess of 50 megabits per second, and just over 40% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to Quantum with speeds ranging from 50 megabits to 500 megabits per second. The incremental revenue from higher broadband speeds is contributing to overall consumer revenue growth.", "In FiOS video, we added 135,000 new subscribers in the quarter, up 13.4%. Total FiOS video customers reach 5.2 million, representing 35% penetration. We also continue to make steady progress with Copper migrations. During the quarter, we converted about 80,000 customers. Through nine months, we converted nearly 250,000 customers, so we are on track to exceed our target of 300,000 customers for the year. By year end, we estimate that less than 1 million consumer customers will be remaining on Copper services within our FiOS footprint.", "This network evolution initiative is important for us as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technology. Aside from the maintenance expense savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, convergence of fiber also provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which could result in additional ARPU over time. Another positive result in the quarter was the steady improvement in our residential connection trends. Retail residential connections declined by 4.9%, compared with a loss of 6.3% at this time last year.", "Let's move to our enterprise market next on Slide 12. In the third quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $113 million or 3%. Legacy CPE sales were down 21% and represented $91 million of the year-over-year decline. Excluding the quarterly decline in CPE, Global Enterprise revenue was down less than 1%. Keep in mind that our Global Enterprise revenue includes both, federal and state government.", "Strategic services, which now comprise 58% of Enterprise revenue, grew 5.2%. We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space. In the public sector, we are seeing the effects of sequestering, budget cutbacks and contract renewals. In the private sector, many enterprise customers are more focused on improving their cost structure which puts pressure on our top-line revenue. Generally speaking, enterprise customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions.", "Moving next to global wholesale. Quarterly revenues declined $113 million or 6.3%. While this quarter is an improvement, the revenue pressure is driven by the continued decline in legacy transport services. As we have stated, our wholesale strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next generation Ethernet services. In terms of profitability, while growth in enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of the global enterprise and wholesale continued to put pressure on Wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts which we believe will ultimately improve our operating efficiency.", "Let's now turn to slide 13. To summarize our overall Wireline results, total operating revenues were down 1% in the quarter. FiOS and strategic services continued their positive growth trends, while global enterprise and wholesale were pressured by declines in legacy transport services and CPE. Excluding the decline in legacy CPE, our revenue performance this quarter was essentially flat year-over-year.", "In terms of Wireline profitability, third quarter EBITDA increased to $2.2 billion resulting in an EBITDA margin of 22.7%. On a year-to-date basis, the Wireline EBITDA margin was 22.1%. We continue to expect that our full year EBITDA margin will be similar to 2012, excluding the effects of Sandy from last year's results. We also continued to target improved profitability and margin expansion in 2014.", "Let's turn to slide 14 for a discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation in the quarter remained very strong. On a year-to-date basis, cash flows from operations increased to $28.4 billion, free cash flow increased to $16.6 billion, up 23%. This does not include the $1.9 billion of proceeds form the sale of the 700 B spectrum licenses, which is included in cash flows from investing activities.", "Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.2 billion and were $11.8 billion year-to-date, up 4.3%. We estimate that full year 2013 capital spending will be approximately $16.6 billion. We are very focused on improving investment returns and capital efficiency and expect that our annual CapEx to revenue ratio will improve, even with the planned additional spending in 4G LTE.", "Wireless capital spending in the third quarter totaled $2.5 billion. Year-to-date, Wireless CapEx was $6.7 billion, 10.8% higher than last year. As noted on our last quarterly call, our 4G LTE coverage build is essentially completed. So our capital spending going forward will be focused on adding capacity and density to our existing coverage. We are utilizing our AWS spectrum to further optimize the network and we are already spending some of the incremental capital we allocated to Wireless capacity.", "In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.5 billion year-to-date, which was down 3.2% from last year. In terms of the balance sheet, total debt increased to $99.1 billion due to the permanent financing we have put in place related to the pending transaction to obtain full ownership of Verizon Wireless. However since we do have a cash until the close of the transaction, our net debt to adjusted EBITDA remained quite low at about 1.1 time.", "Let's summarize. Our third quarter results were very strong, showing consistent performance in all our key strategic growth areas. In Wireless, continued strong growth in service revenue coupled with high quality connections growth and the success of our Share Everything plans are driving double-digit growth and EBITDA and very strong cash generation. We continue to lead the industry in profitability and we are on track to deliver 49% to 50% EBITDA margins for the full year. We also expect to see customer growth increase sequentially in the fourth quarter.", "In Wireline, consumer revenue growth of more than 4% continued to be driven by FiOS, where we are on track to achieve our net subscriber growth targets. In Enterprise, we continue to focus on strategic services and have announced our new Verizon Cloud strategy.", "In terms of an update on our pending transaction to gain full ownership of Verizon Wireless, our permanent financing is secured and we have taken our bridge financing facility, and S-4 Registration statement and our proxy statement were filed on October 8, and are under review by the SEC. You can access these filings on our investor relations website or the SEC website.", "Efforts are underway to obtain required regulatory and shareholder approvals. We expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2014. Overall, a great third quarter, we are focused on continuing our momentum and finishing the year strong.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you, Fran. Brad, we are now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. You may go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two quick ones. First, on the Wireless margins. Fran, how much of an impact did the Edge plan and the 24-month upgrade cycle have in the strong margin you guys posted in the third quarter? And then how should those issues affect the fourth quarter? And then I thought you talked about the uptick you had in the Wireless CapEx. You talked about the AWS deployment. Can you give us a little bit more detail on how that gets laid over and just sort of how quickly can you get some more capacity into the market on the LTE side?", "Fran Shammo", "Good. Thanks, John. On the VZW margins, so Edge, keep in mind we launched Edge at the very end of August. It really didn't really pick up speed until September. Our indirect channels did not get it until the very, very end of the quarter, so there really was no impact from the Edge program to these results. I mean, we will see more in the fourth quarter and we will wait to get to that to report it out, but very, very immaterial impact.", "On the 24-month cycle it's very hard for us to determine, because again people are proactive on when they upgrade to a cycle basis. Of course, you know it did delay some of the upgrades from going from that the 20-month to the 24-month and that went into effect on September 1, so again only really 30 days of impact there. We will probably see more of that in the fourth quarter.", "As far as the VZW margin impact from the two of them, I would say very, very limited in this quarter and you can see why the margin was the way it was just from an overall revenue increase and some of the cost containment measures that we have been putting in place for quite some time and we could talk more about that.", "As far as CapEx goes, so here is where we are at. Obviously, we know that we have completed the coverage build of our 4G LTE and an obviously if you look at our map, it's pretty significant coverage compared to our competitors. Now post June, all of our efforts have gone into the capacity and densification. And given where we are, if you look at some of the metrics, I mean, if you think about 38% of our customers are on the 4G network and they are generating 64% of the data usage, this is a pretty significant volume of usage going through that network and we know that given the growth of this we have had some densification issues in major cities like New York, Chicago, San Francisco and we are totally focused on those types of issues, and what you see us doing is being very proactive in more in-building coverage, more densification cell sites, launching the AWS spectrum, so you are going to see that through in the fourth quarter and that's why we increased the CapEx spending, but I think the walk-away here is, is that we are extremely focused on our network. It is our brand, we will continue to perform in this area and also the return here if you think about every dollar I put into that network when you have 64% of the data on a tiered, shared everything plan, you can see that coming through from our revenue, so the return on the invested capital is pretty immediate and it's pretty significant, so we will continue to concentrate on that effort.", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Right. Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay. Brad, we are ready for the next call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jason Armstrong of Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead with your question.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions, I guess focused on Wireline. First, the FiOS volumes very, very strong quarter in broadband. I think it adds up almost 30% year-over-year. Saying that, the extent to which video is bundled to this, looks to have taken a bit of a hit in the quarter. I think there is a 40,000 disconnect between broadband adds and video adds in the FiOS side. That's much larger than normal. Can you help us think through that?", "Then second, just on Wireline margins. Good progress in the quarter on margins. The comment on margin expansion for 2014, maybe you can help us think through, are there anything that that necessarily relies on? For instance, if enterprise is still under pressure next year, does that put pressure on margins? Or can you grow margins despite that? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Jason. So on the FiOS broadband. We did have a very, very good quarter from a net add perspective, especially on a year-over-year basis and especially since when you look back in history third quarter is normally a very high churn quarter for us. Keep in mind a couple of things here. So on the broadband side of the house you have to remember that as we do 80,000 migrations from our Copper, who are voice and DSL only over to FiOS, you are getting voice and FiOS Quantum adds. And as I have talked before, we really don't approach these customers on a TV product for about five to six months and then it takes us about another three to four months of marketing to actually see some success in conversion and we see about a 30% conversion once we do that.", "They are really interested in the broadband speed and of course what you see in the Wireline segment today is, as we migrate these customers from the Copper product to the FiOS product, we are bringing them over at the same price. But what we see is almost immediately with the speeds that they are getting in the FiOS Quantum, they themselves are choosing to upgrade right into that 50 megabits and at times now even into the 75 megabit products. So their ARPU is going up which is generating some of this Wireline increase that you see. So TV net adds were up 13% year-over-year.", "Now granted, it means some of these adds we have got came from some of the disputes that happened in the competitive nature here during the quarter, but still even without that we would have seen an increase year-over-year in our productivity and our penetration of FiOS. So we are very happy with where we are, but TV will always lag when we do these migrations.", "On the Wireline margin, look I think I have been pretty consistent here with where we think Wireline is going, and I am still very confident that 2014 will show improvement. And just to keep everyone grounded here, the reason I say this is, I am looking at enterprise as being flat, with no substantial growth and we can talk about just the continued disruption that's coming out of Washington and the uncertainty and I think that will continue at least in the short-term here given what happened last night and extending some of this into the first quarter, what's going to happen, what's going to happen when we get to December 31 on the cliff jump off as we had last year with some of the tax preference items. So I still think there is a lot of swirl going on and there is just a lot of uncertainty and the enterprise is going to sit on the side line. But as I look at '14, I am looking as that's going to be flat.", "So what do we see? We see continued progress in our FiOS penetration. As I said, I am very comfortable with 4% plus growth in revenue here going forward. I continue to think that we will penetrate all of our markets and continue to gain share, both in broadband and TV. And also keep in mind, as I said before, with the Hughes Telematics acquisition, VDMS and Redbox, they have all been headwinds this year because we have gotten them up to started and we are eating some of the up start cost with them. That I believe starts to diminish in '14 which actually helps.", "And with Hughes, they start to generate more revenues. VDMS [starts] [ph] to generate revenues. So there is a lot of things happening but I also think we can't lose sight of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma efforts on our cost initiatives that we have in our Wireline business and you are starting to see some of these efforts start to come through on our efficiency side of the house. So we are very, very optimistic that we can continue to move the Wireline profitability forward.", "Jason Armstrong - Goldman Sachs", "Great, that's very helpful. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, let's take the next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Philip Cusick - JPMorgan", "Hi, guys, thanks. I think we all continue to be surprised with the Wireless service revenue growth. Can you talk about where customers are in terms of taking more data than the minimum? How many customers or how many families or per devices are taking more than sort of a standard 2-gig package per device, and where does 4G usage looks now? If not an actual number then versus where average usage was a year ago? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Phil. On the Wireless service growth. Obviously I am not going to get into exactly how many customers break bundles and all that, but I think there is some things that we have to understand here that's driving it, so first off if you look at this quarter, again we had a very strong quarter with 480,000 smartphone adds that are very high quality and these are all coming in mostly on our 4G and shared price plans, some of these are 3G phones obviously, but the majority is coming in on our 4G product.", "The other thing, I think, you have to understand too is that we are coming up on the anniversary dates of the 3G, when the iPhone was launched and those customers now are upgrading to 4G phones and moving into shared price plans. If you look at 3G usage and the customers moving into 4G, and they start to utilize this LTE network, they are starting to realize the benefits of that and their usage significantly goes up from where they were in 3G, so that's stimulating even if we come over and I have said before the way our sales force is approaching this is they recommend 2 gigs for every device that a customer brings into shared pricing, so even with that you think about that usage versus 3G device usage, that in itself is pretty significantly higher, so that drives the revenue.", "Then you look at the tablets and the Internet devices, you get into machine-to-machine connections or machine-to-machine it continues to escalate quarter-after-quarter and then of course then we look at the prepaid side of the house, so I think it's a combination of all of these things that are driving that. When you think about 42% of our basis on shared plans, we still have a long way to go of converting a lot of that 3G product over to the 4G and into the shared plans, so there is still a lot of runway here to continue to grow this revenue stream for us, so that's that and I think I answered the 4G versus the 3G usage.", "Philip Cusick - JPMorgan", "Then if I can just follow-up quickly on your government comment a few minutes ago it sounds like you are a little cautious on 4Q in terms of enterprise decision making and things like that. Is that a fair read?", "Fran Shammo", "I think the cautious is, Phil, I don't see anything changing here from 3Q to 4Q. Again, you heard me say that keep in mind our federal and state government are in our Enterprise segment and that really is declining faster than the rest of the segment right now. Now, the positive to this is, is that within our cloud services it's fairly flat, so where we see the federal government during the sequestering period pulling back in some areas, they are actually buying some of the data center and cloud products so there is a balance here, but I don't think things get a lot worse but I don't see them getting any better.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, let's take the next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Fran, I wonder if you could update us on the VoLTE rollout, when we are going to start to see that and when you start to see the benefit of lower smartphone cost and lower subsidies going forward? You touched briefly relating to the Vodafone, about the ability to bring converged solutions together, maybe you can expand on that little bit and talk a little bit more about what we might see from the cable joint venture over the next few quarters. Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "On VoLTE rollout, we are still on track, you will probably see us have a VoLTE capable handset here in the fourth quarter. As we said that we will light up the VoLTE rollout starting in the first half of next year, so we are still very much on track on that one. As far as lower smartphone cost and subsidies, look, I think the ecosystem has a lot here. You are going to see a lot of new and innovative products come out in the fourth quarter, but subsidy is done on a handset-by-handset, manufacturer-by-manufacturer. Then obviously as you have heard me say before, the more manufacturers we can get into this ecosystem, and it really comes down to an operating system, the more competitive nature this marketplace will become, so I still believe that that will happen.", "Obviously, you have heard me talk about VoLTE will contribute to some, as we start to remove some of the CDMA chip, but then there is other technologies like multi class, multicast that will be put into the phone. So there is a lot of technologies being removed from the phone, but new technologies that are being implemented into the phone. So this is going to be a long path, but I do think, as I said before, subsidies will gradually come down over the next two to three years.", "On the converged solutions side, look I mean as far as the joint venture with the cable companies, we have talked about, we still have a distribution agreement with one another and we continue to work with one another to sell each other's products. But the marketing joint venture or co-development has been terminated and we are moving in our separate ways on that. And what you are going to see here is, as we talked about Verizon Wireless, the acquisition of Verizon Wireless, we now get to more of a converged middle with our consumer products between FiOS and Wireless and we no longer have the artificial wall up between the affiliate transactions or anything like that. So I won't talk about what you will see, but I think what you will see from us is a move forward of bringing to the customer the best product available between Wireline and Wireless.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. First on Verizon Wireless. Can you give us an some update, Fran, on the net debt?", "Then secondly, on the Wireline side, I think you mentioned that you have less than 1 million Copper customers in your FiOS footprint, if I got that quote correct. Can you talk about the significance of that in terms of the opportunity to take those remaining Copper customers and get them over to the fiber and the potential cost savings that you could generate by moving to fiber and really getting the one network architecture within your FiOS footprint, for at least the residential customers? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Okay, thanks, Mike. So I guess this should be the last quarter I have to answer this question on net debt. So gross debt for Wireless is $10.2 billion, cash is $6.6 billion, net is $3.6 billion. On the Wireline side, yes you did get the quote right. So there will be less than 1 million customers that are on Copper within our FiOS footprint. And you see us from our migration strategy in the last two years, I think in the last two years now when we exceed our 300,000 for this year, we will have moved close to 600,000 customers from our Copper network into our FiOS network. We will continue to approach this migration.", "Now, if you think that we do 300,000 a year, you are looking at three more years to get that completed, but we will continue to try to accelerate as much as we can. And from a cost benefit, obviously what you are seeing is some of those benefits coming through the Wireline results today just from a repair metric, from a truck roll metric, the reliability of this network is drastically different than the reliability of the Copper network. So you are going to see us continue to invest in the FiOS infrastructure.", "One of the things that we are doing now is the network team has been working over the last year in provisioning the FiOS network into our enterprise and small business customers using the GPON technology. So we fully expect to utilize this FiOS backbone much more than it had been in the past. So you are going to continue to see this migration and you are going to see the cost benefits coming through our operating results.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "And Fran, I just have follow-up on one other thing. So if you think about your Wireline footprint in total, are there any updated views on what you do outside of this core FiOS footprint?", "Fran Shammo", "Well what you are going to see us do is, obviously now, we have done some of this in the past, but using Wireless, our Fusion technology, from a broadband perspective. So when we talk about converged solutions and bringing the best solution to our end user customer, this goes into what we do with our Copper customers outside of the FiOS footprint and what do we do for them from a voice perspective and also a DSL perspective. And obviously we have Home Phone Connect and we have Voice Link on the Wireline side that we have already started to sell to our Copper voice customers as a substitute to the Copper product. So we have already done some of this but you are going to see more technology come out here in 2014 that's going to address these issues.", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, let's take the next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "David Barden - Bank of America", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two if I could. Fran, just on the Wireline side. The consumer business has been really on fire, the best performing part of that entire segment right now and it's really been in the last two quarters or so that you have added about a $500 million worth of run rate revenue in that business and I know FiOS actually was growing in terms of net adds faster last year on average than it's growing this year. Can you talk a little bit about what the real drivers of that consumer business are and can we extrapolate those into 2014?", "Just teasing a part of your commentary about enterprise, if you took out the CPE or kind of talking about global enterprise being flattish year-over-year, but obviously government is a wake on that. Is it then can we interpret that the basic Enterprise business coming from non-government sources is actually starting to grow year-over-year? If you could kind of elaborate on that, it would be helpful. Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, David. On the Wireline consumer business, I think when we size this all up we really have three main focuses. As I have talked to you before, we have become a very disciplined pricing strategy around our FiOS product and we looked at cable a number of years ago, we looked that they were very, very disciplined in how they did price ups to match their content cost and we were not really good with that, but we started this as you know last year, very early in the year and we have a strategy going forward so we will continue to drive that strategy of pricing up the product equivalent to our content cost increases.", "If you look at the next level of concentration we have had is, we are going after market share. Now as far as slowness in the net adds there is some seasonality here, there is always something that happens in the environment that causes us, but look I mean there are some markets that were over 50% penetrated, so those markets have a slower growth, but we are still gaining share in some of our later markets like New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, which are, in my mind, underpenetrated to where they should be, so you are going to see a little shift.", "There could be some slowness though as we start to penetrate some of these markets in 50%, but the fact of the matter here is that we still have a long runway. If you look at our 39% penetration we still have a long way to go from a net add perspective, but the other thing that's driving this growth and we can't lose focus of it is the migration of these FiOS, of these Copper customers over to FiOS, and as we convert them as I said, it may take us a little while but then we get that uptick in our TV product along with that.", "The other focus that we have too that is not in the top line, but really comes in through content you see us doing some very innovative things around negotiation of content moving away from a per subscriber-type content to more of a per viewer-type cost of content, so we are in lot of conversations with content providers that were willing to pay for people who watch their programs, but were not willing to pay on an overall subscriber base and we have been successful here with some of the smaller tier content carriers, but that's also benefiting the profitability of this product going forward, so I think there is a whole combination of why we think that we will continue this 4%-plus revenue increase with continued penetration and continued profitability on FiOS.", "On the enterprise side, when we say relatively flat if you take out CPE, our decline in enterprise will be 0.8% this quarter versus 0.9% last quarter, so the government is declining faster than that. I would sit here and tell you that enterprise is growing. We do have certain areas of our business that are growing. If you look at our security product, if you look at our cloud products, if you look at the Terremark product, they are in fact growing, Hughes is growing, but then you have the legacy voice and data that is not growing and that's declining, so net-net, I would say it's relatively flat without the government pressure.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from of Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks for taking the question. When you launched the Wireless deal, you had talked about an objective of getting back to your pre-deal leverage levels. I believe you said about four to five years, but correct me if that's wrong, but regardless of the timeframe I was hoping maybe you could just comeback and talk about some of the foundational assumptions that support that goal. For example, do you expect to see capital intensity continue to improve. I am curious what you are assuming about your ability to maintain or even grow your Wireless margins over that four to five year period? Then lastly, can you give us any color what you budgeted for spectrum purposes?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, thanks, Brett. So look, I am not going to get in to the details of what we have projected. If you think about everything that we had considered here, we considered tax, we considered CapEx, we considered the incremental tax rate. As I said, our tax rate will increase to a 35% to 36% range from what we have always guided from a 31% to 33% range and that's because of the VZW coming over. We had to project out what our interest rate was. We know what that is now, based on the offering that we did.", "As far as CapEx goes, I have been pretty consistent here. You should consider us improving our CapEx to revenue ratio going forward. You should look at us as to what we have invested this year and we are going to do what we need to do to continue to invest in our networks, and our platforms.", "But moving out of this, there were three priorities that we set up to come to that four to five years. One was we will continue to invest in our networks and platforms. That is top priority for us. Next is, is we will continue to invest and buy licenses, either opportunistically or in the auctions. I can't tell you what that number is because obviously it's going to be a public auction and we have a lot of strategies around how we acquire licenses. But that was built into our model.", "And then finally, the dividend policy is also a very critical piece of this component to our equity shareholders and I think our board show that when they increased the dividend at the same time that they announced the deal. They are very confident in our cash flow.", "Then finally, we have a commitment that we will de-lever the balance sheet as quickly as possible. So look, I think if you look at the performance, if you look at our cash flow and our free cash flow this quarter, I think we are demonstrating that that four to five years is within our horizon and we will meet our targets.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "And are you assuming you can maintain margins at roughly the same levels.", "Fran Shammo", "I am not going to get into giving guidance around margins. I think our performance speaks for itself and the margins speak for themselves.", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, Brad. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays", "Hi, thank you very much and good morning, folks.", "Fran Shammo", "Good morning.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays", "Fran, just a follow up on the prior question around VoLTE rollout. What does this mean in terms of network investment here? And specifically what I am trying to understand is are you where you need to be with respect to your network in order to provide ubiquitous VoLTE services nationwide? Or should we expect some additional investment in order to get to that level?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, so, Amir, on this one, it's a good question. But look, the issue with VoLTE is coverage. And as I have always said, we will not rush the VoLTE launch until we are sure that when you connect up a VoLTE voice call, it will be very, very similar to a 3G CDMA call, because that's what our customers expect. They know what the CDMA footprint is. They know where they can call. It's an unbelievable network. We have to make sure that our VoLTE experience is the same and that's why we have taken such a long time and we believe that when we get to the first half of next year, the network will be ready, the experience will be very, very similar and that we will be ready to roll this out. But it is already built into the CapEx that we are spending. You should not see incremental CapEx for rolling VoLTE. It really is around coverage and of course it goes into the densification and capacities.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays", "That's very helpful. And if I may, I just have a follow-up here, somewhat of a bigger picture question. As you mentioned this is sort of the fourth consecutive quarter in which you folks have posted 8% plus Wireless service revenue growth. How sustainable do you think this is going forward. And the way I am thinking about it is, what advantage does now controlling the full cash flow of Verizon Wireless provide you in driving initiatives to sustain this level of growth?", "Fran Shammo", "Well again, it goes back to the earlier answer that there is a lot of things going here and if you look at just sustaining this growth, I think I have been pretty open that says, look I can't sit here and tell you that 8% growth is going to happen forever in Wireless. I mean you are talking a huge base of revenue. So I do think that the growth rate will come down over time. But look, I mean there is so much technology being developed throughout the world that's running over LTE. If you look at our innovation center in Waltham and roll this out of our innovation center that we just opened up in San Francisco to welcome all the application developers into that center, so it really comes down to the application developers developing new technologies around LTE, so it's hard for me to determine what this continued growth rate will be but there is a lot of run way, there is a lot of technology and the growth rate is still there. Now, I will tell you that in the short-term, I do believe that we can continue on 8% growth, but over the long-term I would tell you that I think that's probably a high aspiration.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays", "Great. Thanks for the incremental color.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Your line is open.", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "I wondered if you could review where you are specifically in terms of the AWS rollout. I think it's been quoted from the key partner you are going to end the year at 5,000 AWS sites. Where are you at the end of Q3, and can you confirm the 5,000 number and what the target would be at the end of '14? Also maybe what kind of user speeds uplink and downlink you are seeing in the AWS markets versus the 700 markets particularly in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, you have cited higher congestion?", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Kevin. Yes. Look, I mean we are not going to get into a speed discussion, because speed has a lot to do with nobody is on the network, so obviously you are going to generate a lot higher speed, and what we are building the network for is a very consistent reliable experience and we have always said that the network engineers have designed the LTE network when it is fully loaded and that's the key here. When it's fully loaded, and obviously with 64% of data being driven through that network, it's pretty loaded, you are going to experience on average 10 megabits to 12 megabits.", "Now you will get burst of 20-30, and I know there was a report that came out about AWS of 80, but there's no one the network, so I think it would be irrelevant for me to speak to that, but here is the point. The point is, is that we are doing a lot around our network. We are launching the AWS. As I said, we are launching a lot of technologies and the issues what they were currently having in some of the larger cities with the densification these are started to be fixed in the third quarter and we are going to make a lot of progress in the fourth quarter, so I think that's really what's important here. To me, it's kind of irrelevant how many cells sites have what, it all comes down to the quality of the network, the reliability and the consistent performance of that network.", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "You touched on the incentive option. How long do you think this AWS spectrum can carry you and if the incentive option gets pushed back for whatever reason, do you have enough capacity in AWS to last you through 2016-2015? What are the scenarios?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, it's not just AWS, because we can re-appropriate our CDMA spectrum in [this] we need over into our LTE network, so as I said before given the timeframe we are in now, we are good for at least three-plus, four years with the spectrum holdings we have, but obviously we are going to participate in the auction, we are going to need more spectrum for the future of our business and we are going to invest in that spectrum.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Maybe just two Wireless clarifications and an update maybe on what your cloud strategy is at this point. I know you are launching new product, but on Wireless, can you maybe just discuss market share shifts? Sprint was shutting down the network and T-Mobile has been making some marketing initiatives. Have you seen any real changes out there in market share?", "Then Fran, I know you have talked about the ARPU growth, but are you seeing any resistance for the price increases. It seems that ARPU growth is really, really positive for the longer term trend as it [continues] it's doesn't kick-in. Just if you can talk about your new enterprise kind of cloud data that you launched that would be great. Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Tim. On the market share side, look, I mean we did 927,000 net adds this quarter which was a strong quarter. Obviously, we could have done more, but there was constrains in the iPhone, especially around the 5s, and I think that constrained us for this quarter, but that will roll into our fourth quarter here, so from a market share standpoint, we continue to gain market share.", "Now, I can't sit here and tell you that we don't lose customers to our competitors. If you look at some of the other things that we were dealing with, I mean we do have some low end, if you will, some single line basic phone customers and older 3G smartphone customers. And what we see the shift here is, we are seeing them shift out of postpaid into our retail prepaid products, but we are also seeing some of them shift off to some of the lower end price plans of our competitors.", "We did launch some things in September and we saw some improvement there and we will continue to get aggressive with those types of customers here in the fourth quarter. But from a market share perspective, we are gaining market share. I mean I think we will still post the best quarter of any competitor out there.", "As far as the ARPA trend, look, I mean this just goes what I have said before, as the focus going forward is not necessarily how many net adds I do, it's how we generate the growth of our topline that produces the margins. And this goes around everything I", "have talked about this morning with the quality of the network, 3G to 4G, all of these other devices and some of this ARPA growth, as we say, is revenue per count. I mean these could be, as I said before, these are other devices being attached to the network not necessarily smartphones or tablets. As you know we sold cameras. We have sold a lot of machine-to-machine technology that are in our stores now. So there is a lot of things that are contributing to this. Even if it's $0.50 to $0.60 a subscriber, it's still generating that revenue coming through that ARPA.", "Then on the cloud, obviously for some clarification here. Tim, I think what you are talking about is on October 3, we launched a paid public beta of our new public cloud infrastructure. We are calling this Verizon Cloud Compute and Verizon Cloud Storage for businesses and governments of all size and our technology will give us the ability for this cloud based infrastructure to handle enterprise level workload securely and a compliance with a lot of relevant requirements, which will provide flexibility and economic benefits of generic public cloud.", "So the launch of this cloud is just the next step in our cloud evolution. You are going to see a lot more of this come through in '14. We will unveil new features. We have this technology established in seven of our data centers on a worldwide basis. You are going to hear more of this but it is a trial and a beta this point. And I think you are going to see us do a lot more in '14 and you will start to see some of the benefits there.", "Tim Horan - Oppenheimer", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, we have time for one final question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. You may go ahead.", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Thanks, Fran. Two quick questions. First on SMB. Cable seems to be moving more upstream, at least that's from some of the (inaudible) we are hearing. I am just wondering if you are seeing that and how critical is Wireless as a part of your sales pitch to this segment, because that's obviously an advantage for you.", "Then quickly on pre pay. AT&T has made some more recent comments that they are going to be more aggressive on pricing there, probably more to your league. So just your quick thoughts on your prepaid strategy here? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Alright, thanks, Jennifer. So on small business, look, I always split this between two segments. We have a segment that's within FiOS and a segment that's without, outside of FiOS. Obviously Verizon Wireless does an unbelievable job with small business and Wireless products. But within our footprint, within FiOS and outside of FiOS, there is two things.", "One is, within FiOS we are actually gaining share in the small business environment. The issue is that obviously we have to pass those small businesses with FiOS and quite honestly that has not been not been a concentration of ours. Most of it was to residential homes within our footprint. So now it's building out all of those malls and so forth. So we have gone down the street. Now the issue is getting that in to the small stores of these small businesses. So within FiOS, we are doing a fairly good job.", "Outside of FiOS, it's hard for me to compete with the speeds that cable can offer them through the DOCSIS 3.0 type technology. So yes, we are using Verizon Wireless. We are using Fusion where we can. But it's hard to compete because Fusion can't supplement a hard wired broadband connection into a very populated area. So that segment, we are loosing share. Within FiOS we are gaining share.", "On the prepaid strategy, I have said all along, we have our prepaid on 3G and the theory here is to keep the 3G network as full as possible to contribute contribution margin since we are not investing in that any more and we will continue to get as aggressive as we can and you can see that over the last year and a half we have become more aggressive in the prepaid environment but we also use our resellers to drive the lower end of prepaid, because we don't want the brand of Verizon Wireless connected to that low end environment with the quality premium network of Verizon, so that's the differentiation I think between us and our competitors, but you can see we continue to make strides in prepaid and we will be as aggressive as possible on the 3G network to be competitive.", "Michael Stefanski", "Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. Just a few comments here before we end the call. Our industry has a very healthy competitive environment and we are forecasting continued strong demand for our video and broadband across multiple networks.", "We are executing effectively within this competitive environment, consistently delivering strong results, positioning ourselves for future revenue growth, earnings and cash flow growth and we will continue to invest in all of our networks to deliver the most reliable customer experience and that's what they expect. We are excited about the future as we continue to invest, innovate and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.", "Thank you for joining the Verizon call this morning and have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks Evan. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement and other legends on slides two and three. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.", "Before Fran takes you through the details of our results, I would like to cover a few special items that are included in our reported results. These are displayed on Slide 4. For the fourth quarter, we reported earnings of $1.76 per share on a GAAP basis. This includes several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight. The largest item is a pre-tax gain of $6 billion related to the year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This favorable accounting adjustment is primarily non-cash and is caused by an increase in the discount rate, changes in actuarial assumptions and a greater than projected return on planned assets. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $3.7 billion or $1.29 per share. Partially offsetting this favorable item were pre-tax charges of $865 million related to the transaction to acquire Vodafone\u2019s 45% stake in Verizon Wireless. These transaction costs include net incremental interest expense of $616 million related to the debt raised in connection with the acquisition and the bridge financing and other cost of $249 million. On an after-tax basis, these transaction charges totaled $540 million or $0.19 per share.", "Excluding these non-operational effects, adjusted earnings per share was $0.66 in the quarter compared with $0.38 a year ago, which included a $0.07 per share charge for the direct impact from Superstorm Sandy. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share were $2.84 compared with $2.24 last year, an increase of 26.8%. If you exclude the Sandy impact from last year the increase was 22.9%. The quarterly growth rate disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential. Also the results and growth rates exclude the effects of the non-operational items. With that I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and Happy New Year. Before we get into the details I like to start with an overview with our results in a proper context. 2013 was a great year for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective. Of course the big strategic milestone was in our agreement to purchase Vodafone\u2019s 45% stake in Verizon Wireless which will give us sole ownership of the best asset in the global wireless industry. We have all the necessary financing in place, the special shareholder meetings for both companies are scheduled for one week from today on January 28th and a closing is planned for February 21st. As we have stated the transaction will be accretive to earnings per share by about 10% on day one. Full ownership will also provide access to all the cash flows and give us greater flexibility to develop converged solutions without any integration and due diligence risks.", "Our strategy is to build upon the foundation and strength of our network assets as a platforms for the future growth and innovation. To the end we\u2019re extremely well-positioned in the center of the trends that are driving growth in our industry. Mobility, broadband, video, cloud services and security. Sole ownership of Verizon Wireless along with our portfolio of other assets will enable us to better leverage our capabilities across the entire business. In wireless we completed our LTE coverage build and continue to invest in our 4G network to take advantage of the significant opportunities enabled by this technology as we innovate around our customer solutions. In 2013, we further strengthened our portfolio of enterprise strategic services with the development of a new cloud services product suite. The launch of a mobile healthcare platform and several targeted acquisitions which will enhance our capabilities in mobile video delivery.", "Collectively these moves further strengthen the business and improved our competitive position in key areas of growth. Underlining these strategic imperatives has been consistently strong operational and financial performance driven by solid execution and a disciplined focus on meeting our financial objectives. In 2013 we achieved or exceeded all of our key financial targets delivering on what we said in January of 2013. In wireless we had an excellent year, we added 4.1 million new postpaid connections generated service revenue growth of more than 8% and drove a 15% increase in EBITDA. Our growth in EBITDA was significant, $4.5 billion in absolute terms and we expanded our annual service EBITDA margin nearly 300 basis points to 49.5% squarely within our 49% to 50% guidance for the full year.", "In FiOS we increased our penetration of data and video services by adding more than 600,000 new customers during the year. The scale of our FiOS business and the popularity of our FiOS Quantum speeds drove annual consumer revenue growth for 4.9% up sharply from 3.2% in 2012. In the enterprise space inspite of continued economic challenges strategic services revenue grew 4.6% in 2013. In terms of wireline profitability we got it to a flat EBITDA margin and that is what we produced at 22.2%. In the area of capital spending we met our revised guidance of $16.6 billion which was up 2.7% over 2012. Even with that increased spending level we improved our overall CapEx to revenue ratio as we said we would.", "2013 was a great year of significant earnings and free cash flow growth. Adjusted earnings per share increased to $2.84 up over 26% for the year. Our free cash flow growth was also very significant increasing by $6.9 billion to 22.2 billion, an increase of 45% from 2012. In terms of shareholder value, we generated a total return of 18.6% in 2013 for a combination of stock price appreciation and dividends. For the seventh consecutive year, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase indicating their confidence in our future cash flows and earnings growth. From my perspective, 2013 was a great year of execution resulting in impressive customer growth and significant improvements in profitability and cash flows.", "Now, let\u2019s look at our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 6. Total operating revenue grew 3.4% in the fourth quarter continuing our consistent top line growth trend. For the year, we added $4.7 billion to consolidated revenue, an increase of 4.1%. On a full year basis, the increase in consolidated revenues along with effective cost management resulted in more than 21% growth in adjusted operating income. On the same adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA increased $4.6 billion, up 12.3% for the year. Our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 260 basis points to 34.9%, the highest consolidated margin in eight years. As we highlighted earlier, adjusted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of $0.66 was significantly higher than a year ago. Our earnings performance has been very strong and very consistent with double-digit year-over-year growth throughout 2013.", "Now, let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. We will continue to build on our network advantage in 4G LTE by deploying capital to increase capacity and density to our network. Our fourth quarter and full year Wireless results were excellent. We continued the strong momentum built during the quarter and fitted very strong. Total Wireless revenues grew by $5.2 billion in 2013 and totaled $81 billion representing two-thirds of Verizon\u2019s consolidated revenue. We sustained our strong service revenue performance with 8% growth in the fourth quarter making this our fifth consecutive quarter of at least 8% growth.", "For the year, service revenue grew 8.3%. We generated $8.3 billion of EBITDA in the fourth quarter, up 22.6% from the same quarter last year. Our service EBITDA margin in the quarter was 47% compared with 41.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, EBITDA grew to $34.2 billion, up $4.5 billion or 15%. This is a very impressive accomplishment and a testament to the efficiency of our network and our continuous focus on improving productivity and efficiency throughout the business by applying our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. Our 2013 EBITDA service margin of 49.5% improved by 290 basis points, a very significant expansion and is clearly within the guidance we provided during the year. The other point I would emphasize is the consistency of our Wireless profitability. We have posted margins of 49% or higher in the five of the last seven quarters.", "Now, let\u2019s turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 8. Service revenue growth continued to be driven by more customers and devices, increased data usage and smartphone penetration. Our Share Everything Plans are doing exactly what we expected driving device adoption and stimulating higher usage resulting in increases in both the number of devices and revenue per account. During the fourth quarter, retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 7.1% to more than $157 per month. We have seen consistent growth in this metric. For the full year, ARPA was up nearly $10 or 6.9%. We ended the year with 35.1 million postpaid accounts and average connections per account grew from 2.64 to 2.76, an annual increase of 4.5%.", "As we said, customer adoption of our Share Everything Plans has been exceptional. In just 18 months, more than 46% of our postpaid accounts are on these plans. In 2013 we effectively doubled the number of accounts on Share Everything from 8.1 million to 16.2 million. The value proposition is simple and straightforward and customers recognize the value of share data across multiple devices. Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide 9.", "We had a strong quarter of quality customer growth. Retail net additions totaled 1.7 million, postpaid net adds were 1.6 million and prepaid were 80,000. In terms of the makeup of our postpaid net adds we added 1.4 million new 4G smartphone customers. Total phone net adds were 824,000 when you include the net change in 3G smartphone and basic phone customers. We had a very strong quarter of internet device growth with 675,000 net adds, 625,000 of which were tablets. The remaining net adds of about 74,000 were primarily Home Phone Connect. As usual we finished the year with strong customer growth and have great momentum heading into 2014. To recap the full year we had a total of 4.1 million new postpaid net adds and 4.2 million new 4G LTE smartphone customers. We added 1.8 million new internet devices with tablets representing about 1.5 million of this total. We also added about 360,000 other devices primarily Home Phone Connect.", "The offset to these additions was the net change in basic phones. Total phone net adds were 1.9 million for the year representing about 47% of the total. We ended the year with 102.8 million total retail connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection space reached 96.8 million and prepaid totaled 6 million. Postpaid growth adds increased sequentially to 4.3 million and total of 15.1 million for the full year up 1.7% roughly 60% of our growth adds for the quarter and the full year were smartphones.", "Our postpaid upgrade rate was 7.4% in the fourth quarter and our quarterly average was 7% for the year. As you would expect a significant percentage of our upgrades are smartphones which benefits us from a service revenue perspective. About 23% of upgrades in the quarter were basic phone customers getting a smartphone for the first time. The majority of the remaining upgrades were 3G smartphone customers moving up to a 4G smartphone which we were able to monetize through higher data usage and lower cost to serve.", "Our churn metrics continued to be market leading. Our retail postpaid churn was 0.96%in the fourth quarter down one basis point sequentially and up one basis point year-over-year. Next let\u2019s turn to slide 10 and take a look at device sale and our progress in 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations, which include both gross adds and upgrades, totaled 11.52 million in the quarter. This is higher than any prior quarter in 2013. For the full year total postpaid activations totaled 41.5 million. Smartphone activations totaled 8.8 million in the quarter, an 87% were 4G LTE. For the year smartphone activations increased 7.8% to 31.1 million. Smartphone penetration increased to 70% of total phones. About 58% of our smartphones are 4G. We still have approximately 25.5 million basic phones and 24.7 million 3G smartphones in our customer base which gives us plenty of opportunity in 2014.", "We had our best quarter of tablet activations since they were first introduced in late 2010. We activated about 790,000 postpaid tablets in the quarter and 1.9 million for the full year. Our tablet base now stands at 3.6 million, so again we have a great opportunity in 2014 to expand this category and generate growth. 4G device penetration within our postpaid base really picked up in 2013. At year-end 44% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G up from 23% one year ago. Usage on our network continues to rise; currently about 69% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network.", "Going forward we will continue to add capacity and optimize our 4G LTE network ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability that they expect from our network and devices.", "Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting on Slide 11. Our Wireline investments in platforms such as FiOS, global IP, security, cloud services and machine-to-machine enabled us to deliver the services, applications and solutions that our customers want. As these services scale, they will become increasingly efficient and will improve our overall cost structure.", "In the consumer and mass markets business, we continue to see positive revenue trends. For the last six quarters, consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the fourth quarter, these revenues were up 6.4%, driven by FiOS price increases and incremental revenue from FiOS Quantum. We believe that consumer revenue growth in excess of 4% in 2014 is sustainable. FiOS now represents about 73% of consumer revenue and we sustained strong double-digit growth throughout the year. FiOS consumer revenue grew 14.9% in the fourth quarter and 14.3% for the full year. Within our base, 46% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribed to Quantum with speeds ranging from 50 to 500 megabits per second. In the fourth quarter, 55% of our FiOS Internet sales were at speeds in excess of 50 megabits per second.", "Our overall consumer monthly ARPU increased to $117, up 10.8%. Roughly two-thirds of our FiOS customers are triple-play, which have a much higher amount of recurring revenue per month. In terms of adding new customers, we are focused on profitable growth and have been disciplined in our approach in this very competitive market. In broadband, we had 126,000 new FiOS Internet additions in the fourth quarter and now have 6.1 million subscribers, representing 39.5% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers were a positive 20,000.", "In FiOS Video, we added 92,000 new subscribers in the quarter. Total FiOS Video\u2019s customers reached 5.3 million, representing 35% penetration. We also continue to make steady progress with Copper migrations. During the fourth quarter, we converted about 80,000 customers. For the full year, we converted 330,000 customers exceeding our target of 300,000. This network initiative is important for us as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies. At the end of the year, less than 1 million consumer customers remained on Copper services within our FiOS footprint. Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide customers the opportunity to purchase FiOS services, which would result in additional recurring revenue. Looking at access lines, retail residential connections declined by 5.2% compared with a loss of 6.2% at this time last year.", "Let\u2019s move to our enterprise markets next on Slide 12. In the fourth quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $200 million or 5.2%. Legacy CPE sales were down 25%. Excluding the quarterly decline in CPE, Global Enterprise revenue was down 2.6%. We also continued to see pressure in revenue from the public sector, which declined at a double-digit rate. This decline included both soft demand and product rationalization at the federal, state and local levels.", "Strategic services, which now comprised 59% of enterprise revenue, grew 2.3%. Key areas of investment such as datacenters, cloud and security services are growing at higher rates. We continue to work through economic challenges in the enterprise space in addition to public sector pressures. In the private sector, many enterprise customers are more focused on improving their cost structure, which puts pressure on our top line revenue. In general, enterprise customers continue to be cautious regarding new investment decisions.", "Moving next to global wholesale, quarterly revenues declined $138 million or 7.8%. The revenue pressure is caused by the continued decline in legacy transport services. As we have stated, our wholesale strategy is to better monetize our global IP and fiber network by driving a more efficient migration to next generation Ethernet services. In terms of profitability, while growth in enterprise strategic services is improving the revenue mix, volume declines in the rest of global enterprise and wholesale continue to put pressure on Wireline margins. Through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program, we are making good progress in our cost restructuring programs and retooling efforts which we believe will ultimately improve our operating efficiency.", "Let\u2019s turn now to slide 13, to summarize our overall wireline results. Total operating revenues were down 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 1.4% for the full year. FiOS and certain strategic services continued their positive growth trends. While global enterprise and wholesale were pressured by declines in legacy transport services, DTE and challenges in the public sector. In terms of wireline profitability fourth quarter EBITDA was $2.2 billion resulting in an EBITDA margin of 22.4%. For the full year EBITDA increased 2.5% to $8.7 billion with an EBITDA margin of 22.2%.", "As expected our margin is similar to 2012. As I\u2019ve stated in the past we\u2019re confident that we will increase our wireline EBITDA margin in 2014. Let\u2019s turn to slide 14 for our discussion of our cash flow results. Our cash generation in the quarter remained very strong. For the full year cash flows from operations increased to $38.8 billion an increase of more than 23%. Free cash flow increased to $22.2 billion up 45%. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.8 billion and were $16.6 billion for the full year, an increase of 2.7%. We continue to be very focused on improving an investment returns and capital efficiency and our annual CapEx to revenue ratio improved from 14% in 2012 to 13.8% in 2013. At the segment level wireless capital spending was $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $9.4 billion for the full year up 6.4%.", "In wireline capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the year down 1.8% from 2012. The strength of our financial position enabled us to raise a record setting amount of capital in the debt markets last September. We ended the year with total debt of $93.6 billion with all the permanent financing in place related to the pending Vodafone transaction.", "We have a positive track record in terms of deleveraging the balance sheet. Our pre-transaction leverage ratios were very low and we utilize cash for an entire 8.1 billion in bonds during 2013. Even though we have more debt our balance sheet remained strong and we retained the financial flexibility needed to grow the business. In 2014 our priorities for uses of cash are unchanged. We will continue to invest in our networks, purchase spectrum and delever the balance sheet in a prudent and disciplined manner.", "We do not need to execute any major acquisitions to drive our business model. We understand the importance of our dividend and our Board of Directors have shown us support by improving dividend increases in each of the last seven years. In terms of capital spending we estimate total spending in 2014 to be in the range of $16.5 billion to $17 billion with continued improvement in our annual CapEx to revenue ratio.", "We will be opportunistic in terms of acquiring new spectrum and has consistently demonstrated our ability to execute on this through a number of secondary market transactions. Our willingness to sell or swap lower band spectrum with competitors shows our industry leadership and strong belief that spectrum to be in the hands of companies that plan to deploy this spectrum and put it to use. As far as pension funding requirements our minimum required for 2014 is $1.2 billion based on our current plan assumptions.", "As far as additional forward-looking information for 2014 we intend to provide that on our first quarter earnings conference call in April. Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We enter 2014 with confidence and our ability to take advantage of the growth opportunities in our key strategic markets. We will continue to invest in our networks as the platforms for future growth and innovation. We have strong momentum in wireless and we expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of devices and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets and continue to differentiate ourselves with our FiOS Quantum product and quality of our video services.", "In the enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms like cloud, security, machine-to-machine and video delivery demonstrating to customers that we have a unique set of capabilities to provide customer solutions in a rapidly changing mobile first environment.", "In terms of our cost structure, we will continue to drive productivity improvements and operating efficiencies throughout the entire business utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about execution. 2013 was a great year. Our focus on the customer and improving the value proposition drove consistent top line performance and resulted in significant growth in profitability and cash flows improving our investment returns. For 2014, Lowell and I have challenged our business leaders to build on the strong foundation we have, accelerate the momentum we have achieved, improve the returns on our investments and create more shareholder value. We look forward to another great year in 2014.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Fran thank you. Evan, we are now ready for questions.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Okay, thanks. Good morning guys.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Hey John.", "", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Hi. Wireless margins were better than we thought. It looks like partially due to the lower upgrade rate. Is Edge putting pressure on the number of upgrades and do you expect that the number to be lower in \u201814 than it was in \u201813? And then secondly, T-Mobile\u2019s new strategy with ETFs has been getting a lot of attention, how do you see that? Is that sort of an incremental change or do you think more of a fundamental change to the industry and how do you expect that to affect your business as you look out to \u201814? Thanks.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Hi, thanks John. Good morning. On the upgrades side, obviously the volume of upgrades this year were less than last year given all of the policy changes that we made and also keep in mind that at the end of 2012, we also had a free iPhone for the first time on our network, so that drove a lot of upgrade activity year-over-year so we had less volume this year. As far as the Edge program, the Edge program is going very well for us, but I would tell you just to give you a sense, it\u2019s generating less than 1% of our profitability right now. So this is not a significant portion of our portfolio, but obviously given the competitive environment here. First off, let me just reiterate the fact that I know there has been a lot of questions around a price war and if you really look at what\u2019s going on really what\u2019s the shift of pricing is between service and equipment and really when you do the math, there really isn\u2019t much of a price decrease here. It\u2019s just a shift of how that\u2019s marketed into the consumer market. So obviously, Edge is important to us from a competitive standpoint, but I am not going to give guidance John on where our upgrade rate will be in \u201814. As I said, I will give more guidance here once we close the Vodafone transaction. We have a shareholder vote here in a week. So I think it\u2019s \u2013 it would put us in a \u2013 at a very peculiar situation to give a further guidance at this point in time. So I will give more guidance on that at the end of the first quarter. So that\u2019s where we stand.", "", "John Hodulik - UBS", "Great, thanks.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Evan, let\u2019s take the next question please.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Phil Cusick - JPMorgan", "Hey guys. Thanks. I guess two. One, can you help us think about Wireline margins next year, how do you think about the issues of total revenue being sort of flat to down and mix issues versus cost cutting just trying to sort of scale the potential for Wireline margin growth? And then second on the OnCue platform, can you give us some more color do you envision a full MSO over Wireless are out of region eventually versus more of a in region and sort of ancillary product? Thank you.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Hi, thanks Phil. Good morning. So Wireline margin, look I think that I had been pretty clear on this. Coming into this year, I said we would be flat given a lot of headwinds that we have from some of these startup products we have, especially around the Redbox joint venture, VDMS and some other things in there. So look, we are very optimistic that we can improve this margin in 2014. As far as top line, what I gave here today is we are very confident that we can sustain the 4% plus top line growth on the Wireline consumer piece of this. And as you noticed, we did our price ups here in the fourth quarter of this year which is different than what we have done in the past and that was to prepare us for obviously the January 1st which is when content cost go up in all of our contractual arrangements. So we have put ourselves in a position this year to offset that content increase which we weren\u2019t in a position last year. So we have done some strategic things from a top line perspective. Obviously enterprise continues to be a press point and I would say that we don\u2019t plan for that to change in \u201914 and I\u2019ve said that coming into \u201913 and leaving \u201913 that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see much of a change in our enterprise that top-line position in \u201914. So I think that the cost cutting measures of Verizon Lean Six Sigma some of the improvement in some of these other ancillary platforms where obviously we acquired Hughes Telematics that is now growing topline revenue coming into the fourth quarter of this year. You probably saw today we just signed another agreement with Hyundai to acquire their business.", "This is a growing platform but it does put pressure on us because we\u2019re hiring people and it was a loss when we acquired it and continued to be a loss through \u201913 and I think that could change some in \u201914.", "So there is a number of things here and I guess what I would say is I\u2019m confident that we can improve the margin of our wireline business going into \u201914. As far as the OnCue acquisition, look the focus here is really to accelerate the availability of the next generation IP Video service which will integrate into the FiOS video service and really what we\u2019re trying to do is differentiate this even more so with fiber to the home versus others with the TV offerings and reducing the point in cost and this really accelerates us from if we were try to build IPTV versus buying the IPTV technology.", "From a FiOS customer perspective we expect the benefits that they will have more elegant search and discovery interactivity and cost screen, ease of use but also keep in mind with the acquisition of Verizon Wireless and becoming 100% ownership of that we also plan to take that platform and integrate it more deeply with our Verizon Wireless 4G LTE network. So that really was the strategy behind this. As far as we enable this platform to take us over the top obviously we have our video digital media services that we have been working on for 2.5 years, we have just made two acquisitions related to that platform. So look I mean we\u2019re positioning ourselves strategically to be in a position to competitively compete around the whole mobile first world and video. So I think that\u2019s where we are.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay Evan let\u2019s take the next question please.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "First Fran if you can just give an update on the net debt for Verizon Wireless and then secondly can you talk about the total amount of cost cutting that the Verizon Wireless business achieved during 2013 that contributed to the margin expansion you have had in the past few different initiatives that you were working on. And I was wondering if you can also share your aspirations in terms of the cost cutting potential for 2014. Thanks.", "", "Francis Shammo", "So I guess this will be the last and final quarter that I ever have to do this, hopefully. Gross debt of $5.3 billion, cash of $3.6 billion and net debt of $1.7 billion. As far as the cost cutting side goes look I mean coming into \u201913 we said that Verizon Wireless had already cut about $5 billion worth of cost out of their infrastructure. We said that we were targeting them for another $2 billion in 2013, they actually exceeded that benchmark in 2013 and again I\u2019m going to hold on 2014 here and I will give you more guidance when we get to the end of the first quarter and again it is all around our shareholder vote and the acquisition of the Vodafone transaction.", "", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "If I can just follow-up with a different question then. On the pension side you mentioned the cash investment that you\u2019re planning to make for \u201914 where are you starting off the year in terms of the funding status and then where would that 1.2 billion roughly get you to?", "", "Francis Shammo", "Yeah so with the change in the discount rate and our assumptions around the return on assets are actual unfunded liability from the end of last year to the end of this year has improved by $2.6 billion. So our unfunded liability at the end of the year is for pension is at $5.9 billion. Now that also is very helpful from us well in the annuitization [ph] that we also did there in the \u2013 during the year of \u201813. So it puts us in a very good position with the $1.2 billion minimum contribution that we have into the plan to really start to make this a 100% funded plan. On the OPEB side of the house, our unfunded liability went from $24 billion at the end of 2012 to $19 billion, so a $4.2 billion improvement on that unfunded liability. So when you look at our balance sheet, even with the $8.1 billion of bonds that I paid off, we also had a decrease of over $6 billion in our unfunded liability. So the strength of our balance sheet has really taken off this year with almost $14 billion of a decline in our liabilities.", "", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "Thank you.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Evan, let\u2019s take the next question please.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks for taking the question. Since we have seen some changes in competitive behavior, I feel like we have been getting sort of gathered data points around who is taking share from who, in the past, you guys have always had pretty positive reporting ratios versus all your peers, I know you don\u2019t give that on a regular basis. I am just curious can you either qualitatively or even quantitatively talk about how you feel about your net share gains versus your peers in light of the current environment?", "", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, thanks Brett. Well, I think the fourth quarter will stand on its own at 1.7 million ads and 824,000 net phone ads with the best quarter we have had since we launched tablets of 625,000. And I think that in a combination of itself will stand on its own. But let\u2019s just go back here a second from a competitive environment standpoint and I have said before we will compete and respond accordingly where we need to. And if you recall coming out of the third quarter this question came up and I said look we are seeing a segment of our base that is responding to some of the competitive offers and we will make the necessary changes that we need to, to compete against those changes. And if you look at our churn in the fourth quarter which was unusual because of a seasonal season, we normally would go up in churn from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. In this year, we sequentially declined by 1 basis point. So I think that tells you that we responded to our base, we listened to our customers and this is what we do. Now, the competitive environment has changed again here in the fourth quarter and you can expect us to respond accordingly.", "The other thing I would hedge ourselves on that we have built our brand. They are very long-term and we built loyalty with our customers and they come to us because of our network quality and superiority. We have, if you look at the coverage of our LTE network compared to our coverage, we are by far multiple times more coverage than our competitors and some as much as five and six times more coverage than our competitors. If you look at our Share Everything Plans, we continue to change them. We launched a new price plan. You probably picked up yesterday to go after our basic phone customers. And look I mean, we are going to compete in all devices in all markets. I think that another competitive advantage we have is our customer service and the quality of that customer service.", "If you look at the new store we launched which we call our destination store in Minneapolis, I mean we are going after smartphone customers, but it goes well beyond that from a competitive standpoint. I mean, if you look at that store, we now are going after the sports and fitness with all kinds of devices, music, gamers. We have a whole home section. And of course, we have been talking about the machine-to-machine and tablets for a while now. So again, I think there is more competitiveness than just one little price plan and we will respond accordingly and aggressively and continue to do what we are doing.", "", "Brett Feldman - Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks for that color.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Evan, we can take the next question now.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "David Barden - Bank of America", "Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just first one Fran on FiOS and the quarter was a little soft relative to the trend, but what I noticed was that the footprint path is inching up towards about 19 million, the homes marketed to looks like it\u2019s more in the mid 15 million. Could you talk a little bit about kind of the plans for mining out the rest of the FiOS opportunity and how that might contribute to the expectations for healthy consumer growth? I guess that\u2019s number one.", "And number two, if I can just follow-up on something you have talked about on the Verizon Vodafone transaction, I think Fran you have some estimates about what you thought the flow back was going to be and how it\u2019s going to impact trading in your stock and obviously, I am sure there has been a lot of hedging and things that have moved around. If you could maybe give us a little bit of an update on what you think the movement around the stock is going to be around the transaction based on your latest data will be super helpful. Thanks.", "", "Francis Shammo", "So on FiOS yeah so let\u2019s put it in perspective I mean we came out of the third quarter with an extremely good quarter of growth and the environment became extremely competitive and that the competition went after price and dropped pricing accordingly and we were pretty cautious on how we responded to that. We didn\u2019t believe that we wanted to chase some of those price points in the fourth quarter because we know from our customer experience that a lot of customers do not want us intruding in their houses during the holiday season. So we were cautious on how we responded to that and obviously that led to some slower growth that we had from a net add perspective but here is what I would say is if you look at what we have done in 2013 and the concentration of the Copper to fiber migration which we believe is a more profitable customer at the end of the day. They are just voice and DSL customers.", "So if you look at our internet volumes we actually did over 42,000 more net adds in \u201913 with internet on FiOS than we did in 2012. So that really was the concentration and we exceeded that by 30,000. So we came into the year thinking we would get 300,000 and we did 330,000 and what we\u2019re seeing from this space is once we move them with the same price plans either by voice or DSL they are then buying up as their only voice. They are coming over to our FiOS Quantum offer and if they come over they are buying up FiOS Quantum pretty significantly which is generating ARPUs in the range of $15 to $20 over and above what they were as a Copper customer.", "And as you know we gave a disclosure of 55% of these folks are coming in at 50 megabits and above and we will continue to increase our speeds. We\u2019re working on a new router that\u2019s going to give better in-home performance with all the extra wireless devices that are going on. So when you think about profitability and topline growth FiOS Quantum is extremely important because when you look at broadband versus TV if you look you don\u2019t have the contents of broadband is actually more profitable than the TV product.", "Now having said that as I said in the third quarter there is a lag, once we move these people in marketing to them and getting to move to the TV. So TV did lag this quarter and I expected it to lag this quarter and I expected to lag as we continue to migrate this extra less than 1 million homes that we have, less than our FiOS footprint. But also want to be clear that we\u2019re not going to build beyond what our current LFAs are and as you said we have 18.5 million homes pass now with about 15.3 open for sale on internet and about 15 for TV. So we have plenty of opportunity here but I would also tell you that again with even with the slower growth in the fourth quarter we still took market share and continue to increase our penetration and New York continues to be our fastest growing market with the most penetration this year over any other market we had in the TV arena. So I think that\u2019s what sets us up for \u201914. We will continue to execute on the same things that we have done this year which is concentration on migration and getting those quality customers to buy up in their bundles.", "On the second question of flow back, look I think it's getting harder and harder for me to zero in on what the flow back is given what the market has done and the short positions and everybody positioning where they are. As we said when we came into this transaction we thought the net flow back would be around 300 million shares but keep in mind we will have somewhere between 4.1 billion and 4.2 billion shares outstanding. So it's a pretty insignificant minimal amount based on the volume of daily trading that we think we will have. So that\u2019s really all the thought I can give you on the flow back at this point in time.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Evan next question please.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Mike McCormack - Jefferies", "Maybe a couple of things, you commented regarding the Edge program. It seems like some of the competitors out there moving to EIP which you can argue is a pretty bad deal for consumer and a pretty good for carriers. You know why wouldn\u2019t you guys just get more active in the Edge marketplace and also that subsidy back for the consumer and then secondly on the enterprise side it seems like the industry overall is pretty weak. Can you just comment like the different pushback pieces [ph] there between legacy and new migration? What is the pricing environment look like from a competitive standpoint? Are you seeing any change there? Thanks.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Look on the Edge program as I said earlier we will respond where we think we need to respond. I\u2019m not going to get into what others have done between Edge and subsidy. I mean we had a very successful fourth quarter and what we launched in the marketplace they were receptive to that. We ran a lot of promotions in the fourth quarter and it drove a lot of growth to our business and look, I mean again we will continue to do what we do best, which is we add customers and we are profitable. On the enterprise side of the house, look I mean this is becoming a more and more struggling event here given the uncertainty of the government. Then as you now look to what is more concerned now is the President has nominated Senator Baucus, which who was leading the tax rate format. He has now been nominated to Ambassador of China, which means now that could delay some reform. Now, others are picking it up, but this just gives more room for caution as to what is going to happen in \u201814, are we going to get tax reform, what about the expenders, they haven\u2019t talked about expenders at all. There is a large cliff that we hit here on December 31, which was we lost a lot of credits and obviously the accelerated depreciation deduction is gone. So there is a lot of things that are putting enterprise back on their heels and people are just looking for cost-cutting measures, which mean that means I take a top line decrease in order to maintain that business.", "From a public sector perspective, look I mean the federal government, our sector there is declining double-digits year-over-year and that is obviously putting a lot of pressure here. There are opportunities in that segment that we are exploring, but the way I would look at this is you have seen us make some moves here around EdgeCast and upLynk and video digital media services and you have seen us make some other moves in our cloud and what we have recently launched with our new cloud products in a beta test. So within security, cloud, datacenters and our advanced communications arena, we are growing revenue year-over-year, even more significantly even strategic services overall. So there are certain niches that are growing, but unfortunately have not enough to offset the other declines that we are seeing just form the public sector and some of these other pressures that we are getting from the large enterprise customers. So again, I think \u201814 will be pretty much flat with where \u201813 was. I don\u2019t expect it to get any worse, but it will be a tough slope for \u201814.", "", "Mike McCormack - Jefferies", "Fran, you have talked about in the past, I think the percentage of customers just because that many years probably but percentage of customers have already moved from legacy product into IP Ethernet, is there a metric you can put around that as far as the customer base goes?", "", "Francis Shammo", "Mike, to be honest, I don\u2019t know that off the top of my head, I am sorry.", "", "Mike McCormack - Jefferies", "Okay, thank you.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Evan, let\u2019s take the next question please.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Mark Warren of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "John Mark Warren - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. I was just wondering on FiOS Quantum, you have seen had a lot of success getting customers to upgrade from lower speeds like 10 megabits per second to 50, are you \u2013 is that typically a one-time boost or do you see customers continuing to come back for more speed?", "", "Francis Shammo", "Yes, John thanks for the question. We actually continue to see customers come back. And if you think about this, this is like when you are in your home if you have one or two wireless devices running off of that WiFi at 10 megabits and you start to put three or four devices on that, guess what, you are not getting 10 megabits to those wireless devices anymore, you are getting something significantly less than that. So the only way to compensate for that is to increase the speed into that router, so we see customers 50, 75, 100. I mean as I said, we are going to come out with a new proprietary router that\u2019s going to even increase the speeds even more that are available for those wireless devices as people start to saturate the inside at their homes with tablets and other machine-to-machine connections. So this is an ongoing upgrade that customers are doing. We do this very seamlessly within the Verizon\u2019s FiOS TV product or online, where we pop up things within your TV. You can just click the okay button if you want to upgrade right there and then it automatically does it. There is no phone call needed. So we make it very easy for customers to do that, but yes, we see customers coming back for the second time.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay. Evan, if we can take the next question that will be great.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "Thanks. We started to see a bit of a resurgence in access line M&A activity in the industry. Are there opportunities for Verizon to divest Wireline assets in 2014 or 2015 in order to increase the Wireless mix and de-leverage the balance sheet and if Wireline is a third of revenue today, where would you like to see that in three years?", "", "Francis Shammo", "Well, thanks for the question Kevin. It\u2019s pretty little foresight there on divestitures, but look I think Lowell and I have always said, we will always look at opportunities for anything. And if we feel that we can get an adequate return on our \u2013 for our shareholders based on the investments we have and the properties we have, then we will execute on that. So look I guess, I would say we always have an open mind but at this point there is nothing on the table for us around that. The properties we have are performing extremely well and we will continue to execute on that. As far as the three year view I guess I will talk maybe a little bit more of that when we get to the end of the first quarter call but again I\u2019m not going to give anymore further guidance. But look I think we\u2019re very satisfied with the asset portfolio we have and with the acquisition of Verizon Wireless and only 100% of that asset you\u2019re going to see us do more things around converged solution. So the wireline assets in my view will actually become more valuable over the longer term here with our footprint. So at this point I would say we\u2019re open but nothing on the table at this point in time.", "", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "And you mentioned the loss some of the tax credits for bonus appreciation et cetera. When you think about your capital budget for the year you know are you going to continue to spend (indiscernible) you spend last year for wireless given some of the spectrum and strong subscriber growth or are there risk to the CapEx number to fund some of the tax prior to cash taxes that are likely?", "", "Francis Shammo", "No because I think look we gave guidance on CapEx, it's 15.5 billion to 17 billion. As I said before obviously wireless won't take a higher percentage of that CapEx spend and on the other areas of the business will take a lower portion of that CapEx spend especially as the FiOS builds continues to slow here. But no there is no strategic change in the way we view our investments and I don\u2019t do investments based on tax law. I didn\u2019t accelerate CapEx spending when the accelerated depreciation went into effect. I don\u2019t anticipate on the slow capital spending because it's not there anymore. So I think we will just continue to drive and execute on what we have from a cash tax standpoint as I said before obviously our cash taxes will go up with the acquisition of the 45% of wireless. I guided for next year when we announce the acquisition that we would be somewhere in 35% to 36% ETR. So I think at this point that\u2019s where we will keep it and I will give you more color once we come out of the first quarter.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Evan let\u2019s take another question please.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Mastrogiovanni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Joe Mastrogiovanni - Credit Suisse", "Fran you have potentially some spectrum opportunities in the secondary market and ten you\u2019ve a couple of spectrum options coming up. How should we think about the way you prioritize the low band spectrum versus maybe the mid and high band spectrum.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Well look I mean it's obviously I think we have shown that we have made the secondary market a very viable market. We have done a number of swaps with Leap, T-Mobile. Sales with T-Mobile and AT&T and some swaps even with AT&T in that key sale that we did. As far as our portfolio obviously we like the 700 megahertz for the coverage of LTE that we did. AWS is our sweet spot at this point in time which is the spectrum that we have been swapping for. So we have a very efficient portfolio of spectrum and I think we have shown through the years that we are very efficient on how we use spectrum. Keep in mind that as I said we will participate in the auctions because we will need more spectrum but right now our current position is with the AWS we have and that we\u2019re launching in markets that you know in New York and San Francisco, Chicago. We\u2019re lighting that spectrum up. It's pretty much completed in New York. We will continue to add to that but keep in mind though too that we will also reappropriate our 3G spectrum to 4G. We will take that PCS spectrum that\u2019s been running in our 3G network as the (indiscernible) of the volume of that network continues to decrease as we move more 3G phones to 4G.", "We will reappropriate that spectrum over to the 4G LTE. So again you know 3 to 4 years we\u2019re in a very good space from a spectrum holding position but we will participate in the upcoming auctions.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Evan next question please.", "", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Chaplin of New Street Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research", "I wonder if I can just follow-up on that last question. So I think the next lot [ph] of spectrum is going to come on to be on to the market as AWS-3. So two questions around that, first of all do you see that as a valuable spectrum block that you really want to be a part of or is there enough opportunity within repurposing some of your 3G spectrum for 4G that that\u2019s not critical and then in terms of deploying that spectrum as it is valuable to you, does it require you to put more equipment on the tower or because it\u2019s contiguous to existing spectrum that you are deploying, can you do it with all existing equipment? Thanks.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Yes. So Jonathan on this one, look we will participate in the options that are coming up whether it\u2019s the AWS-3 or if it\u2019s the broadcast or whatever the FCC is going to auction here in the future. We have to build our portfolio for the next 10 years out. So as we have done in the past and we have shown that when auctions come up, it\u2019s opportunistic they only come up one time, so you need to participate. And that\u2019s what we showed when we won our 700 megahertz and we won the A and the B blocks a while ago and now we have repositioned that portfolio. We have launched the 700 megahertz in the AWS that we have. So AWS-3 is pleasing to us. Some of the higher frequencies is pleasing to us. So again, I won\u2019t get into \u2013 I am not an engineer, so I am not quite sure what happens to have it within the network in order to enable these spectrums, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s much based on what we have done with AWS. So we will participate in upcoming auction.", "", "Jonathan Chaplin - New Street Research", "Great, thank you very much.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, Evan last question and then we\u2019ll wrap up.", "", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Great, thanks. Fran, I just wanted to see if you could give us a little quantify this what I\u2019d call the smart to smartphone device upgrade opportunity, you said you are seeing ARPA lift there, but between the 3G and 4G, I know there is more usage, but is there a way to quantify that kind of ARPA lift you are seeing with these smart to smart movers?", "", "Francis Shammo", "Yes. Look, I am probably not going to give you that, Jennifer. Look, if you look at a 3G usage moving to a 4G, we know that and we have seen it in our base that as soon as you get on the 4G with video consumption and the quality of video, your usage goes up. So obviously, it\u2019s hard for us to quantify this, because with our Share Everything Plan, you are obviously buying a bundle of minutes that you can share among all devices. But as you can see from our service revenue growth, our ARPA lift, our increasing connections, it\u2019s all coming together as to how these plans were designed. And as I said, we still have a lot of 3G customers and a lot of basic customers for \u201814 that give us a lot of opportunity. So I think I will leave it there and the numbers will speak for itself.", "", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Thanks, Fran.", "", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you for your questions today. Before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Fran.", "", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, thanks Mike. Look, our industry has a very healthy competitive environment and we are forecasting continued strong demand for video and broadband across multiple networks. As I said, Verizon will compete aggressively in all of our markets. We will focus on delivering a superior customer experience, one of the best networks in the world. Our customer value proposition and the efficiency delivery of our services will generate growth and profitability. This focus on profitable growth will create value for our shareholders, provide the earnings and cash flow necessary to reinvest in our networks and platforms for future growth and innovation. We are very excited about the future. We will continue to invest, innovate around solutions deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our Verizon employees.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "", "Thanks David. Good morning and welcome to our first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I am here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "Before we get started, let me remind you that our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will be made available on our website.", "I would also like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are also available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.", "The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran takes you through the details of our quarterly performance, I would like to cover a few details about our reported results. For this discussion, let\u2019s turn to Slide 3. For the first quarter, we reported earnings of $1.15 per share on a GAAP basis. Our reported results reflect a partial quarter with 55% ownership of Verizon Wireless in just over five weeks to full ownership. Since this transaction to acquire Vodafone\u2019s stake closed on February 21.", "The weighted average common shares outstanding for the first quarter were 3,430 million. Given the issuance of 1,275 million new shares of Verizon as part of the deal consideration. The timing of the closing had no effect on our consolidated income statement for Wireless segment above the operating income line since we\u2019ve always had operating control of Verizon Wireless.", "All of the post-closing effects of full ownership are below the operating income line. Our reported first quarter EPS of $1.15 includes several non-operational items that I would like to review. The first item is a gain on the sale of our minority interest in Vodafone Omnitel.", "This resulted in a one-time after-tax gain of approximately $1.9 billion or $0.55 per share. This is a non-cash item as it was part of the transaction consideration. The next item is a non-operational charge related to debt redemption. During the first quarter, we announced a partial make whole redemption and a cash tender offer for various notes with maturities over the next five years and coupons of 5.5% entire. We regained $5.4 billion of notes through the make whole redemption and tender offer.", "The associated net pretax costs were $923 million. After tax this resulted in a charge of $575 million or $0.17 per share. We also incurred interest in financing costs related to the wireless transaction. As we did in the third and fourth quarters, we are excluding these charges from adjusted results for the period January 1 through the February 21 closing.", "These transaction costs total $411 million on a pretax basis resulting in an after tax charge of $260 million or $0.08 per share. Excluding the effect of these three non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.84 for the first quarter compared with $0.68 a year ago or growth of 2013.5%.", "Adjusted EPS of $0.84 reflects 55% ownership of Verizon Wireless for the period January 1 through February 21 and full ownership for the remainder of the quarter. Of course, future quarters will include a 100% of the Wireless net income and access to all the Wireless cash flows.", "For an illustrated non-GAAP view of adjusted earnings, assuming full ownership of Verizon Wireless for the entire first quarter, let\u2019s take a look at Slide 4. The elements for this illustrated view are based on the adjustments in the pro forma financial statements filed with the SEC for the periods ending September 30 and December 31 2013. We also review these transaction effects on February 24 call when we provided some guidance for items below operating income.", "Adjusted EPS of $0.84 would have been $0.91 per share assuming 100% ownership of Wireless for the full quarter. Again, on a non-GAAP illustrated basis. The adjustments required to demonstrate this are relatively straightforward.", "The 45% of Wireless net income attributable to Vodafone for the period January 1 to February 21 totaled $1.2 billion and would be added to adjusted earnings.", "The transaction related cost for the same time period would be subtracted. Accounting for these effects, adjusted earnings would be $3.8 billion with an effective tax rate of about 35%.", "The diluted shares outstanding that we use for this illustrated EPS calculation were 4,149 million shares, which assumes the newly issued shares were outstanding for the entire quarter.", "In summary, the impact of having a 100% ownership of Wireless for only part of the first quarter was worth $0.07 of earnings per share.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "", "Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone. As I stated on our last few conference calls, we have great confidence in our ability to generate strong financial performance in 2014.", "Over the years, our steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms have supported innovative products and services and fueled our growth. Our wireless and wireline networks will continue to be the hallmark of our brands and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage.", "Now that the Wireless transaction is behind us, we have the immediate financial benefit of earnings accretion from the deal and full access to the very significant cash flows of Verizon Wireless. As we have previously stated, we are targeting 4% consolidated top-line growth in 2014 with an expansion of our consolidated EBITDA margin.", "The ingredients for success are unchanged, solid operational execution and a disciplined focus on meeting our financial objectives and creating value for our shareholders. With an eventful first quarter behind us, I\u2019d say we are off to a strong start.", "We maintained our growth momentum and delivered excellent top-line and bottom-line results. While the timing of the Wireless transaction closing caused some reporting complexity, our $0.84 adjusted earnings per share represent a growth of 23.5% and would be even greater if we assume full ownership of Wireless for the entire quarter.", "We have consistently delivered high quality earnings growth with double-digit increases in reported and adjusted earnings per share in eight of the last nine quarters. Our cash flow generation in the quarter was also impressive and we continue to invest in our networks and platforms.", "Our Wireless results were very good with service revenue growth of 7.5% and a service EBITDA margin of 52.1%, an expansion of a 170 basis points. In FiOS, our positive revenue growth trends and scale drove a 6.2% increase in consumer revenue. Total wireline operating revenues declined 0.4% in the quarter which is our best result in nearly three years.", "In terms of profitability, our EBITDA margin was 22.3%, up 90 basis points. Now, let\u2019s get into our first quarter performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 6.", "Total operating revenues grew 4.8% in the first quarter continuing our consistent top-line growth trend and was our highest growth rate in the past five quarters. Top-line growth was once again driven by Wireless and FiOS. In terms of new revenue streams, machine-to-machine and telematics were still relatively small are beginning to emerge and make positive contributions with revenue growth in excess of 40%.", "Our focus on operating efficiency and cost controls is enabling our ability to compete effectively and drive consistent profitable growth. In the first quarter, consolidated operating expenses grew 2%. Operating income growth was 15.1%. We have posted double-digit growth in operating income in eight of the last nine quarters.", "Consolidated EBITDA grew 9.3% while our EBITDA margin expanded by 160 basis points to 36.7%. Let\u2019s take a look at cash flow results next on Slide 7. When looking at our cash flows, it is important to keep in mind that post transaction, we have immediate access to the full Verizon Wireless cash flows.", "And apart from a contractual tax distribution in the second quarter for the stub period, we will no longer be making any cash distributions to Vodafone. As a result, the amount of cash available to us will be significantly greater this year. This is true for the simple reason that under the partnership structure, 45% of excess cash at Wireless would at some point be distributed to Vodafone.", "As we discussed on our February 24 call, there will be some lack of comparability between current and prior periods in the statement of cash flows. In 2014, the cash flows from operations line will include higher cash payments for interest and taxes. The cash flows from financing section will have lower cash distributions to Vodafone and higher overall dividend payments to our shareholders due to the increase in shares outstanding.", "In the first quarter, cash flows from operations were $7.1 billion, which included an incremental $1.3 billion of cash interest payments and $200 million of pension funding that we did not had in the first quarter of 2013. In spite of these additional uses of cash and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $3 billion in the quarter.", "For illustrative purposes, free cash flow available to Verizon in the first quarter was more than $1 billion higher than a year ago assuming that 45% of the free cash flow at Wireless would have been distributed to Vodafone. Again, the point here is more free cash flow available at the corporate level than prior to the transaction even after higher interest payments and cash taxes.", "Capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $4.2 billion, up $548 million with all the increase in Wireless. With our 4G LTE coverage build complete, Wireless spending is now focused on adding capacity intensity to our existing coverage and utilizing our AWS spectrum to further optimize the network.", "As we have previously stated, our estimate for total capital spending in 2014 will be in the range of $65 billion to $70 billion. In addition to the transaction closing, we had a large amount of financing activities in the quarter.", "At closing, our gross debt was approximately $114 billion. Since then, we announced the make whole redemption and a tender offer did some debt restructuring and had $2.5 billion of notes mature. We ended the quarter with gross debt of just under $110 billion and net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.5 times.", "Our balance sheet remains strong and we have the financial flexibility needed to grow the business. Our priorities for cash utilization are unchanged. We will continue to invest in our networks, acquire Spectrum and return to our pre-transaction credit ratings profile within four to five years.", "We do not need to execute any major acquisitions to drive our business model. We understand the importance of our dividends and our board of directors has shown its support by approving dividend increases in each of the last seven years. In terms of acquiring new spectrum, we will continue to be opportunistic.", "Earlier this month, we signed agreements to acquire the wireless licenses of Cincinnati Bell along with some power lease. We will continue to look at the secondary markets and we will consider the opportunities in the upcoming FCC auctions.", "Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 8. Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. We will continue to build and expand our network advantage in 4G LTE.", "Our focus is on deploying capital to add density to our network and deliver new services such as VoLTE and multicasting to enrich our customers\u2019 wireless experience. Regardless of what others claim, recent national surveys from widely recognized third-party organizations confirm our leadership.", "Our own dry testing which we have been doing for years shows that we consistently deliver the best customer experience market-by-market and day-by-day across the United States.", "Total Wireless revenues grew to $20.9 billion, up 6.9% driven by strong service revenue growth of 7.5%. We generated $9.4 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 11.3%. Our Service EBITDA margin in the quarter was 52.1%. There has certainly been a lot of investor attention centered on the effects of equipment monthly payment plan options for customers.", "Let me be very clear and provide the financial impacts of our Verizon EDGE plans for the first quarter. As you would expect, the number of customer activations on EDGE increased sequentially and is also running ahead of our expectations. The estimated EBITDA benefit from the accounting treatment under these plans was worth about $165 million, which equates to less than 2% of total EBITDA in the quarter.", "The benefit to our service EBITDA margin was approximately 90 basis points. While EDGE had a favorable effect on profitability, our results demonstrate that we delivered EBITDA growth and margin expansion over and above the benefits of equipment monthly payment plans.", "Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 9. Service revenue in the first quarter was driven by 4G smartphone adoption and tablet growth and increasing data usage. In mid of February, we introduced our More Everything plan which provides more value through simplified data allowances and more choice for customers.", "In addition, we revised our monthly pricing under Verizon EDGE for customers who buy their devices on installment payments. Last week, we extended this reduced monthly pricing to customers who are currently out of contract. These pricing actions improve the customer value proposition and will help drive further penetration of 4G smartphones and tablets and stimulate usage on our very cost-effective 4G LTE network.", "Retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 6.3% to nearly $160 per month in the first quarter. The lower monthly pricing under the EDGE plans had a minimal impact on ARPA this quarter.", "Going forward, continued EDGE adoption will likely have a greater impact on ARPA due to the shift from service to equipment revenue. Our reduced monthly pricing for out of contract customers will also affect the rate of service revenue growth over time. We ended the quarter with 35.1 million postpaid accounts and connections per account grew to 2.77 up 3.7% from a year ago.", "More Everything plan adoption continues and we ended the quarter with 50% of postpaid accounts on these shared data plans. The majority of these accounts are in data tiers of 4 gigabytes or higher and usage continues to drive migration to the higher data tier.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 10. In the first quarter, postpaid gross adds totaled 3.6 million, up 4.1%, about 56% of our gross adds were smartphones and 33% were tablets and other internet devices.", "Retail postpaid churn was 1.07%, up six basis points year-over-year. On a net basis, we added 549,000 new retail connections in the first quarter. Postpaid net adds were 539,000 and prepaid were 10,000. At the end of March, we had 103.3 million total retail connections.", "Our industry-leading postpaid connections base reached 97.3 million and prepaid totaled just over 6 million. The first quarter postpaid add mix included 866,000 4G smartphones and a record 634,000 tablets. We also had 56,000 other connected device adds primarily home phone connects.", "These additions were offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones resulting in a negative total phone net adds. Our postpaid upgrade rate was 6.5% in the quarter; more than 88% of these upgrades were smartphones.", "Consistent with our plan to drive smartphone penetration and 4G adoption, about 1.5 million or 27% of our smartphone upgrades were from basic phones. More than 50% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve.", "Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and take a look at device sales and our progress on 4G LTE. Postpaid device activations which include both gross adds and upgrades totaled 9.9 million, an increase of 2%. We have 7.6 million smartphone activations, of which nearly 90% were 4G.", "Smartphone penetration increased to 72% of our total phones. We ended the quarter with 61.3 million smartphones and about 64% of those were 4G. So we still have about 22 million 3G smartphones and a little more than 23 million basic phones in our base which provides us with a good opportunity to move customers upgrade 4G smartphones.", "We had our best tablet quarter ever, activating 814,000 postpaid tablets, virtually all of which were 4G. This is more than double the amount from the first quarter last year and about 3% more than the fourth quarter.", "Our postpaid tablet base now stands at 4.3 million, so again, we have a great opportunity to expand this category and generate growth in 2014 and beyond. Overall, 4G device penetration continues to steadily increase. At the end of the first quarter, 49% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 28% a year ago.", "Data and video usage on our network continues to rise; currently about 73% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. We will continue to focus on expanding our network advantage, investing to add density and to optimize our 4G LTE network ensuring that customers are receiving the quality and consistent reliability they expect from our network.", "Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets\u2019 revenue performance on Slide 12. In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS.", "For the last seven quarters, Consumer revenues have grown in excess of 4%. In the first quarter, Consumer revenues were up 6.2% mass markets which include small business grew 4.9%.", "FiOS now represents about 74% of Consumer revenue and we are sustaining strong double-digit growth. In the first quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 14.6% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and quantum penetration. About 51% of our FiOS internet customers subscribe to Quantum which speeds ranging from 50 megabits to 500 megabits per second.", "We continue to focus on adding quality customers and generating profitable growth. Residential broadband and video are very competitive markets and we continue to be disciplined in rational in our approach to customer acquisitions. In Broadband, we added 98,000 new FiOS internet customers in the first quarter and now have 6.2 million subscribers representing just under 40% penetration.", "Overall, net broadband subscribers in the quarter were a positive 16,000. In FiOS video, we added 57,000 new subscribers in the quarter. Total FiOS video customers reached 5.3 million representing 35% penetration. We also continue to make steady progress with fiber migration.", "During the quarter, we converted about 78,000 customers from copper to superior fiber technology. This network initiative is important as we systematically reduce our dependence on older technologies. We\u2019ve begun to see the benefits from a maintenance perspective in what was one of the worst winters in recent memory in the Northeast.", "Aside from maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services which will result in additional recurring revenues.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 13 and review our overall Wireline segment revenue and profitability. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the first quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $164 million or 4.4%. Revenue declines in Legacy Transport Services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer applications which are smaller in scale.", "Strategic Services which include Private IP, Ethernet, Datacenter, Cloud, Security and Managed Services, grew 1.8%. This category includes some revenue from the public sector where we continue to experience revenue pressure.", "In general, Enterprise customers continue to be more focused on improving their cost structure rather than investing for growth which creates top-line pressure for us. In our Global Wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $108 million or 6.4%.", "While we had healthy demand in Ethernet services in the quarter, it was not enough to offset the impact of technology migration, price compression and other secular challenges.", "From an overall Wireline perspective, total operating revenues were down 0.4%, EBITDA was $2.2 billion, up 3.4% resulting in an EBITDA margin of 22.3% for the quarter. Our strategic investments in network technology enable us to deliver reliable and high quality services and solutions to consumers, small businesses and enterprise customers.", "As we scale these key products and services, they will improve our overall revenue mix and drive further operating efficiency. We are focused on network operating efficiency through improvements in service provisioning and dispatch and repair rates. We remain confident in our ability to increase Wireline EBITDA and expand the margin in 2014. Our financial performance in the first quarter was a good start.", "Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. We are off to a strong start with a 4.8% increase in consolidated revenues and a 160 basis points EBITDA margin expansion. We continue to post high-quality double-digit adjusted earnings growth and have a strong cash position with full access to growing wireless cash flow.", "We are on track to achieve our revenue growth, margin expansion and capital spending targets for the year. We have good momentum in Wireless and expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of devices, and extending our leadership position in 4G LTE.", "In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets, and continue to differentiate ourselves with the superior broadband products and are recently introduced FiOS Quantum TV service.", "In the Enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms, demonstrating that we have the unique set of capabilities to provide customer solution. We remain focused on cost structure improvements, to drive productivity and operating efficiencies throughout the entire business utilizing our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principles.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "", "Thank you, Fran. David, we are now ready to take the questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Hey guys, thanks. So I guess, if we \u2013 just talk about subscribers on both sides, churn up in Wireless leading to some handset share losses this quarter and FiOS softer, too. You seem to be responding to T somewhat with the Edge price cuts recently and allowing people to trade down.", "How should we think about the impact to ARPA in 2Q and beyond from these trade-down effects? And then what about responding to cable on the FiOS side? Are you happy with the revenue ramp due to rate increases or do you try harder on subs as we go forward, too? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Hi, good morning, Phil. So, look, I think that, let\u2019s talk about the subs and the churn and then we can talk about the EDGE pricing. So, first off, I think if you put this quarter in perspective, coming into this quarter from the fourth quarter on the end of the first quarter call here or the fourth quarter, we talked about how we would take a very rational disciplined approach in responding to the competitive marketplace. And that\u2019s what you saw us do through the quarter.", "Now having done that, through January and February we saw a lot of pressure around our basic phone customer base which is why we launched our low-end 4G price point on More Everything to give those basic customers a chance and a view into getting over to a smartphone on our 4G network and we saw the improvements through the month of March.", "In addition, if you look at our tablet sales, we said coming into this year, that tablet would be a major growth trajectory for the entire industry and I think that\u2019s what you are seeing. You are going to see that this is a very underpenetrated marketplace and the more we drive tablets into our 4G network, the more revenue stimulation we create.", "So we had one of the best tablet quarters ever even without the Christmas season from the fourth quarter. So, when you look at the churn, the churn was definitely impacted via the basic phone customer base. So, we actually had one of the best quarters ever adding 866,000 4G smartphones to our base and then another 634 tablets.", "So the net effect of the loss was mainly within the basic phone base and some 3G smartphone customers which led us to then refresh our shared pricing to More Everything and then we also had to do some response to some of the EDGE pricing that the competitive marketplace offered in order for us to be competitive within those high-end data plans.", "However, I think it\u2019s also important to say that these installment plans or EDGE plan is a very profitable plan to us. So as we manage the business through prepaid reseller, postpaid subscribers whether they go on a subsidy model or on an installment sale model, these are all accretive to the business and very profitable plans.", "So, if you look at the ARPA, obviously ARPA since it does not include equipment revenue, the increase in the take rate of EDGE will definitely have an impact on that metric and do I expect the EDGE take rate to increase?", "Yes, because, if you look at the first quarter, most of the EDGE products were sold through our direct channel and we will be expanding that to the indirect channels coming here at the very end of the first quarter, mainly in the second quarter.", "So the EDGE take rate will increase, which will have an impact on service revenues and the ARPA metric. So, we will have to think about that going into the second quarter that's how report that. But again I feel very confident in coming out of the first quarter with 7.5% of service revenue growth and the ARPA growth.", "Now, as far as the competitive pressures and some of the other moves we\u2019ve made, look, I mean, this goes back to when we first went to shared pricing, we said that it would be dilutive in the short-term but it would drive usage on our network and by moving to EDGE and out of contracts and it\u2019s a very small base of customers because you have to be on More Everything and include it in the base.", "But obviously in the short-term, this could create some revenue pressure for us, but again it\u2019s moving these customers to higher daily usage plans which drive more usage which in essence drives more revenue. So the guidance we have given you, I stand firm on, because we\u2019ve considered all of this into our forecast.", "So, I don\u2019t really anticipate changing any of that at this point in time. If I move over to the cable environment with FiOS and the net add, there were two really main things here that happened. First off, we did a price increase in the fourth quarter and every time we do a price increase, we always see some pressure in the churn in the following quarter.", "But also we had probably one of the worst winters on record here and people did not want us in their houses to install FiOS. But I think a couple of things to point out. One is the competitive pressure from cable did increased in the first quarter.", "\\We did not respond immediately because of the environment that we were dealing in weather. So we waited, we became more aggressive in March and I would tell you that exiting the quarter, our pipeline has grown and I have a viewpoint that the second quarter will be back on track from a net add perspective.", "So, Phil, I\u2019ll leave it at that and hopefully that answers your question.", "Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "That helps. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, David, let\u2019s take the next question please.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Great, thanks a lot. Good morning, Fran. Just to quickly follow-up on EDGE, have you had any change in your view about the \u2013 kind of the sell activity of the EDGE product? It seems like T-Mobile and AT&T are pushing these fairly broadly, and in the past you have sort of said you want to reserve this for your best customers. Any change there?", "And then perhaps you could touch a bit more on the network. Where are you on the AWS rollout and have you solved all the congestion problems you were talking about a couple of quarters ago? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Simon. So, first on EDGE, look, this is a customer choice. This is not what I want. It really comes into our customer choices and again, we are going to allow our customers to choose the right plan for them and if you look at the economics, it depends on what phone choose.", "So, if you decide to take a free iPhone that\u2019s out in the marketplace today, you may be better off going on the subsidy plan for two years end up paying less over time than the installment plan.", "If you decide to take a very high-end handset, then you may benefit by going to the installment sale. So, I think it\u2019s a personal choice. It also comes down to when do you think you are going to upgrade. If you are a customer that wants to hold your phone on for a two-year period of time or longer, it depends what plan you may choose. If you decide, you want to upgrade every year, then obviously the installment plan is the plan that you have to select.", "So, this comes down to personal choice and again our sales forces is not compensated to drive traffic to any one sort of plan. At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about customer satisfaction and treating our customers and the choices that they want. So, again, its \u2013 the way I look at this is, as we manage the business, these plans are all profitable plans to us. So it comes down to customer choice.", "On the network side of the house, I think that, in my script, I was pretty deliberate on making some statements there about some third-party studies that were done in the first quarter and I think that speaks to itself as to where we are with our network.", "We are through the congestion. The network performance is delivering what we expected to and as you see that in our CapEx spending, we are going to be more leveled this year. If you know historically, we\u2019ve always had more of a ramp from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.", "We will be more leveled with that. So we are really concentrating on the density and the diversification of the 4G network, especially in the major cities and that\u2019s where we have deployed AWS and we will continue to deploy AWS throughout the year more into the smaller cities and into the rural markets, but right now the concentration is in the major cities like New York, San Francisco, Chicago et cetera.", "So, Simon, that handles the question. Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, we can take the next question now.", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Thanks guys, thanks for taking the questions. So, Fran, I apologize \u2013 I got \u2013 I have to ask one more on EDGE, too, which is that one of the things we saw coming out of the AT&T result was that there is really two parts to these installment plans.", "One is the mechanical part of changing the accounting where you take some of the service revenue and you put it into equipment revenue and that's the relatively easy part.", "Another part of the puzzle thought was that, if AT&T was very aggressive at pushing this pricing out to people even if they didn't take the installment payment plan because they felt like it was an immunization tool against incremental competition.", "So, could you kind of share with us kind of what we should be expecting from Verizon in terms of not just how the EDGE program is going to unfold, but how you're going to use the EDGE pricing as a competitive tool if it all?", "And then the second question, if I could was, on the Wireline margin side, a pretty strong margin, especially for 1Q, which historically has seen lots of headwinds for bonuses and FICA and other things.", "So I was wondering if you could kind of maybe give us a picture of whether we can use 1Q as a starting point for some of the Six-Sigma improvements and stuff that you are working on for the rest of the year? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "All right, David. Good, thanks. So on the mechanical side, look, I mean, this is a fairly complex accounting for the EDGE pricing. But really there is two main components to this. First is you book up the receivable, you record the revenue over the time, but the amount of revenue that you record is based on the residual value that you assign and the liability that you set up for that telephone.", "And I would say that, our approach is going to be extremely conservative. So, we will probably be recording less revenue upfront under the installment sale, just so that we can get a feel for what the uncollectability is going to be over time.", "How much value these phones are going to be worth a year or two years out depending upon how many phones hit the market at the same place. We do think that there could be some saturation effect in the outer years. So we will take a very conservative approach here on the accounting.", "As far as the competitive environment, look, I am not going to speak for anybody else. I think, we\u2019ve shown, we will be rational and deliberate on how we respond to the marketplace. We are responding to our customers\u2019 requests.", "This recent move that we made related to allowing out of contract subscribers to move over to the EDGE pricing, I believe is a good move for us because again it treats our customers the way they want to be treated and it is a retention tool for us. So, it will help to deliver a lower churn metric in the future. And it\u2019s up to them whether they want to move, we are not going to deliberately move our customers, it will be totally to their choice.", "So, that's from a competitive environment. On the Wireline margin, I think that, at least everything Lowell and I had been talking about for the last two years is starting to finally come through on the metrics of Wireline.", "And just a couple of things, I think in the past, I\u2019d probably be sitting here asking for a test based on the Northeast corridor storms for the entire winter and one of the worst winters on record.", "And normally I\u2019d be sitting here talking about repair rates and how much expense we have to incur. And here we sit with all of the copper to fiber migrations that we have done over the last two years, we did another 70,000 plus this quarter. This is really starting to come in through the maintenance side, because fiber performance is much better during these weather conditions than copper performs.", "So, I think that all of the Verizon Lean Six-Sigma segments and I told you I was very confident coming into this year that we could improve the Wireline margin on a year-over-year basis and I hold to that confidence because of the things that I see between Verizon Lean Six-Sigma and also because of the copper to fiber migrations that we\u2019ve been able to form.", "In addition, of course, the good driver of revenue here is through our Quantum products and the uptake of our customers to the higher speeds and willing to pay more for those higher speeds and also the congestion in their houses because of the wireless devices they are running off of that Wi-Fi network really demand that fiber into the home that only FiOS can provide.", "So, I think everything together is driving this. We can talk about the Enterprise segment but as I said coming into the year, I think that best we will look at what we did last year and I think that\u2019s where the position will be as we will probably not see any improvement in Enterprise in 2014. Thanks, David.", "David Barden \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Great, thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, let\u2019s take the next question.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "", "Hey guys. Thanks. Fran, and just one thought on smartphones obviously becoming a bigger part of the base. Do you think smartphones are causing shorter handset lives, meaning as we look at adoption of EDGE or other EIP programs with smartphones needing to be upgraded more often. It's actually a better plan for the carriers and particularly for Verizon?", "And then secondly on Enterprise, if you could just comment, you made some comments regarding the decline in revenue there, maybe rank order what you are seeing there with respect to technology change, pricing and then demand? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Okay. So, on the \u2013 look, I think it\u2019s way too early to tell yet how the impact of the installment plans will react on the upgrade rate. I mean, we\u2019ve been at this for years and the upgrade rate is pretty steady. You will have fluctuations based on seasonality, but coming out of the first quarter, we really didn\u2019t see any change in that.", "But we probably really won\u2019t see the impact of early upgrades probably for another six to eight months. So, I think we are going to have to hold on what the expectation there is. But I think the other thing too though is that, just from an overall product set, you know, smartphones are, as I said coming into the quarter, are going to be a slower portion of the growth, I think for the entire industry as we go forward as the penetration grows.", "So we look to those other facets of the tablets and machine-to-machine and then if you look beyond that with VoLTE and multicast giving our customers even additional features that could potentially drive more usage on the network. So that\u2019s really what the future holds for us. The smartphone category, I do believe that upgrades may increase with EDGE, but again I think it\u2019s too early to tell.", "On the Enterprise side, look, I think what we continue to see here is that the United States is the highest corporate tax payer in the world and until we fix that situation, with all the discussions in Washington whether extenders will happen, won\u2019t happen, whether we\u2019ll get through tax reform or we won\u2019t get the tax reform, there is just too much uncertainty out there for enterprises to really lock down on where they are going in the future.", "So, I think, this is where we are playing right now. The public sector is still a major drag on our results and as you know, we include the public sector in our enterprise results. And that's also now impacting the strategic services because they are also starting to cut and move away from some of the more strategic products.", "So, I think, for this year, we just, we are satisfied with being flat with last year which is what I came into this year saying, and I think if we can resolve some of the issues and the uncertainties, and I think we are on a better path for enterprise. But right now, I think we are where we are.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "", "Okay, Fran, just on the pricing situation, is that a competitive issue or is it just technology change that lowers the price points for the product sets?", "Fran Shammo", "No, look, we are extremely competitive and have a great product set in our Enterprise space and obviously if we get into the details, I mean, if you look at security and look at our cloud services, they are growing.", "If you look at the huge Telematics platform, that\u2019s growing in the enterprise space, but then we have all this legacy voice and core and even within the IP products, you see the price compression happening on those products and each year it comes up for renewal you have a price compression.", "So, some of it is competitive, but we are in an extremely competitive environment. But look, I mean, people are just cutting enterprises are still focused on cost structure. They are not increasing their investments, they are increasing their spends. So that\u2019s where we sit.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "", "Thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, let\u2019s take the next question.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "", "Hi, thanks, good morning. Fran, I was wondering if we could just take a step back in the Wireline business and just talk a little bit about the homes where you don't have FiOS. I think it\u2019s \u2013 and maybe you can give an update on a number, maybe roughly 8 million homes where you don't have plans to build FiOS.", "What you do in those markets to stay competitive and to try to improve the financial outlook or is that a source of even possible asset optimization at some point? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Sure, Mike. Thanks. This could be a record quarter since you didn\u2019t ask me about net debt on Wireless. So that\u2019s a good thing. But, look, on the FiOS and the copper houses, so, within the FiOS footprint as we said, we now have less than 1 million homes left that are on copper. So we will continue to migrate them.", "Outside of the FiOS footprint obviously, really we are taking two measures there. One is the Wireless portfolio and replacing some of that that old voice legacy copper voice with our LTE voice product that Wireless has been selling across the nation for almost two years now called Home Phone Connect. Within Wireline, they have a very similar product called VoiceLink which in essence is the same thing.", "So we will try to replace that copper legacy with those technologies. But look, I mean, outside, this is kind of where you say it\u2019s you have to nurture it and harvest what you have and we know that we are not going to be able to compete with speed in that environment and we will continue to do the best we can.", "Now, there will be certain areas, maybe another year or so, where we may look to extend the fiber a bit and include some small businesses which we compete extremely well in within the FiOS footprint and they are very profitable customers.", "But beyond that, Mike, I think we are in harvest mode and we will continue to do the best we can with the technologies we have as alternatives for our customers.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "", "Thanks very much.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "", "Okay, thanks, guys. Fran, just quickly back to EDGE if we could, can you give us a sense of what the take rates you are seeing on smartphone sales these days? I think you said that it increased with the change in pricing, but if you could give us some color there that would be great.", "And then maybe the percentage of smartphones now that are on Edge pricing. And then maybe if possible, how that is going to evolve over time, especially now that you are moving some of the off-contract customers over to the new pricing?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, thanks, John. So, as far as the take rate on EDGE, I would tell you that we were less than 15% in the first quarter from a take rate. I expect that to potentially double with the launch of this payment plan option within our indirect channel. I would also say that, it is going to become more and more difficult for us to separate out and give a normalized basis with and without EDGE.", "And the reason I say that is, as we start to launch this in our indirect channel, you are going to get into all kinds of confusion of how the commission works, who bought the phone, who is doing \u2013 we will do the installment on that, but we may not have actually sold the phone to the indirect.", "They may have bought it outright. So there is implications with how compensation will work. So although we gave you separate data here in the first quarter because it was easy, because it was just within our direct channel, I think that is going to become more complicated going out here.", "So, from a take rate perspective, it\u2019s hard for me to tell what the take rate will be. But I do believe it will probably double into the second quarter with the launch of our indirect channel John. So that's really all I can talk about on the EDGE. It\u2019s too early for us to tell what the rate will be.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "", "Okay, but in terms of the percentage of smartphones in the base that are on EDGE is it sort of mid single-digits at this point?", "Fran Shammo", "It\u2019s less than 2%.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "", "Less than 2%, got it, okay. All right, thanks, Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Thank you very much. Fran, two areas I would like to touch on and this is sort of dovetailing on the prior question. You mentioned that EDGE penetration will increase, potentially doubling next quarter. I was wondering if you could give us how much of your earnings growth is attributed to sort of your expectations of rising penetration of EDGE?", "And then secondly, now that you've fully integrated the contribution of the Wireless business from Vodafone, how should we think about the quarterly progression of earnings now that there is a larger portion of your revenue is coming from one \u2013 what may argue \u2013 one could argue is a less fluctuating wireless business, which may now include less contribution to subsidy costs if EDGE penetration rises? Thanks a lot.", "Fran Shammo", "Sure, Amir. Thanks, so on the EDGE and the contribution, look, as I just said to the previous question it\u2019s going to be very, very hard for me to start to separate this given the indirect channel.", "Look, I think the guidance we have given, I stand behind the guidance that we\u2019ve given, we\u2019ll do our best to try to give some clarity in this going forward, but as I said it\u2019s going to be a cloudy environment and it\u2019s hard for me to sit here today to say, oh, EDGE is going to contribute X basis points of my profitability.", "I just don\u2019t know, because I don\u2019t know what the take rate will be. And I want to make sure we talk about take rate not penetration. So, it\u2019s going to be the take rate of new additions, not the penetration of the base. As far as quarterly earnings, this is a great question, because, historically, you would see more of an uptick in the second and third quarters.", "And I think now that we have a 100% of Wireless, you are going to see a more consistent earnings per share for us going forward other than the fourth quarter obviously which is more seasonal.", "So that has its own issues. But, I think you are going to see a more consistent first, second and third quarter and then the fourth quarter will have its own decline, because of the seasonality with that. So that\u2019s a good question and thanks for asking.", "Amir Rozwadowski \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Thanks a lot for your incremental color, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, let\u2019s take another question please.", "Operator", "", "And your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Thanks, can you talk a little about the recent FCC regulatory comments regarding net neutrality and the broadcast auction rules; what your positions are on this and how you think this evolves over the next several months?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, so, I know the FCC was issuing an order today on net neutrality. I have not had a chance to look at the order. We will be excited to read that order and then we can give our comments on that. So, unfortunately, being on the call, I have not seen it and been updated on that.", "And as far as the auctions go, look, I think that, we are obviously preparing for those auctions. As I talked about in the beginning here with our gross debt, we are preparing our balance sheet and our financial wherewithal to participate in these auction is coming up.", "And, look, as we continue to look at these rules, and work through these rules, we will continue to \u2013 behind the scenes if you will, work with the FCC to get the rules that we need.", "But, it\u2019s an important step forward for the pool of spectrum available to meet our customer needs and we will certainly take advantage of what the FCC is working on as far as the auctions go.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie", "", "And when can we expect to hear more details about your video strategy? I think you said last quarter it would be soon. So, is it still soon or is it very soon?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, this is \u2013 Kevin, this is on the over-the-top type strategy or?", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie", "", "Yes and just EdgeCast and VDMS and all of the aggregation of the intellectual property that you bought in the last 12, 18 months.", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, so, video \u2013 Verizon video, digital media services is ramping up. We are still in what we would call a dataset with a lots of content providers and testing the system and I believe as I said before that will \u2013 that revenue will start to ramp in 2014. So that\u2019s the first step in just putting content through and digitalizing that content potentially inserting ads into that content.", "Obviously, we added the uplink and the EdgeCast assets to that and really that was in preparation to prepare for the over-the-top if you will. But I think it\u2019s still way too early to tell on the on queue acquisition obviously the first priority for us it IPTV.", "But as you overlay that to the other asset sets, what I would say is, we are in a great position to take advantage of the marketplace when and if content starts to sort itself out from an over-the-top perspective. So, that\u2019s probably all we would say at this point in time on that one Kevin.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, David, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "", "Your last question comes from Joseph Mastrogiovanni of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.", "Joseph Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. Fran, if I could just follow-on to the last question, how should we think about \u2013 how you are thinking about splitting your budget between the AWS and the broadcast auctions?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I think it\u2019s too early to tell. I guess, what we are focused on, or at least, what I am focused on right now is the AWS auction which we know will happen at the end of this year with attainment being sometime in the first quarter. So that\u2019s top priority and then we\u2019ll deal with the broadcast licenses after that within 2015. So right now, the priority is AWS.", "Joseph Mastrogiovanni \u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, that ends our questions. So I\u2019d like to turn it over to Fran for some closing remarks.", "Fran Shammo", "So, thanks, Mike. So, look everyone, thank you for joining us this morning. And I think I would just recap that said, the first quarter for us was a great start to the year. We consistently invest and focus on the profitable growth to drive strong financial performance and revenue earnings and cash flow, we are focused on customer satisfaction.", "Our proven ability to scale this business and drive operational efficiencies in order for us to deliver more value to our customers and compete effectively in all areas of our business. We continue to focus on our strategy to deliver the highest quality overall customer experience.", "We listen to our customers, monitor the competitive environment and respond where necessary in a rational manner. We are very confident in our ability to execute and improve on our business fundamentals driving consistent customer value while delivering growth in customers, revenues, earnings, and cash flow.", "We are very excited about the future of this industry. We are excited about our investment, the innovation curve that we are delivering.

Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are also available on our website.", "The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran takes you through the details of our quarterly performance, I would like to cover a special item that is included in our reported results on Slide 3. For the second quarter of 2014, we reported earnings of $1.01 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a pre-tax gain of $707 million related to the sale of 700 megahertz A block spectrum licenses.", "On the after tax basis, this gain increased reported net income by $434 million or $0.10 per share. As we\u2019ve done in the past, we\u2019ve accounted for the gain on the sale of these licenses at the corporate level, so it is not part of our Wireless segment results. Excluding the effect of this non-operational item, adjusted earnings per share was $0.91 for the second quarter compared with $0.73 a year ago or growth of 24.7%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share were $1.76 compared with $1.41 last year up 24.8%.", "Keep in mind that the $1.76 per share first half result does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless for the entire first quarter since the transaction closed on February 21st.", "As discussed on our first quarter call, full ownership for the quarter represents as an additional $0.07 per share of earnings. With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We entered 2014 with the great confidence in our ability to grow the business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future.", "In the first quarter, we closed the Vodafone transaction and delivered strong financial results. On our last earnings call, I indicated that we exited the first quarter with better momentum and expected that to carry forward.", "As you can see from our second quarter results, we delivered on what we said, producing very strong customer growth metrics and Wireless and FiOS, in driving excellent top line growth and profitability.", "We are competing effectively in all markets and executing our strategy which is focused on providing network reliability and a great customer experience.", "Over the past two and a half years, we have delivered consistent high quality earnings results with double-digit year-over-year growth and reported and adjusted earnings per share in nine of the last 10 quarters.", "Our adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 represented another quarter of more than 20% growth. This sustained earnings growth demonstrates our ability to execute effectively in all parts of the business in a highly competitive environment.", "Our consolidated revenue performance was strong with growth accelerating to 5.7%, our highest growth rate in the past six quarters. In Wireless, we had a great quarter of both growth and profitability. 4G device activations were exceptionally strong resulting in $2.3 million 4G postpaid net adds. Total postpaid net additions top $1.4 million, total operating revenue grew 7.5% with service revenue growth of 5.9% and our EBITDA service margin was 50.3%.", "In Wireline, we also had a good quarter with improved growth and margin expansion. Quarterly operating revenue grew 0.3% which is a milestone led by consumer growth of 5.3% as we continue to drive FiOS penetration and customer adoption of our quantum broadbrand and video products.", "Wireline EBITDA increased 4.9% and the EBITDA margin improved to 23.2% up 90 basis points sequentially and 100 basis points year-over-year.", "Our cash generation continues to be very strong enabling us to consistently invest in our networks for future growth and innovation. Free cash flow was $3.3 billion in the quarter and totaled $6.3 billion for the first half.", "Now, let\u2019s get into our second quarter performance in more detail starting with consolidated results on Slide 5.", "Total operating revenue grew 5.7% in the quarter continuing our consistent and improving top line growth trend. Revenue increases were once again driven by Wireless and FiOS. As we indicated last quarter, new revenue streams from machine-to-machine and Telematics while still relatively small are beginning to emerge and make positive contributions with revenue growth of more than 50% in the quarter.", "Our continued focus on driving process improvements and cost-efficiencies is also paying off. In the second quarter, adjusted operating income increased 10.4%. To my earlier point about consistent earnings growth, we have also delivered double-digit growth and adjusted operating income in nine of the 10 quarters.", "On an adjusted basis, consolidated EBITDA grew 6.4% to $11.1 billion. And our EBITDA margin was up 30 basis points to 35.4%.", "Let\u2019s take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 6.", "As we previously discussed, it is important to know the lack of comparative ability between the current and prior periods in our statement of cash flows as result of the transaction to require a full ownership of Verizon Wireless.", "In 2014, the cash flows from operations line will include higher cash payments for interests and taxes. The cash flows from financing section will have lower cash distributions to Vodafone and higher overall dividend payments to our shareholders due to the increase and shares outstanding.", "In the first half of 2014, cash flows from operations worth $14.8 billion which included an incremental $1.2 billion of cash interest payments, $1.5 billion in cash taxes and $800 million of pension funding that we did not have in the first half of 2013. In spite of this additional uses of cash and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $6.3 billion year-to-date.", "Again, the key point on cash flows is a simple one. The amount of cash available task will be significantly greater this year than some of the former partnership structure, 45% of any excess cash at Wireless would at some point be distributed to Vodafone. So even after a higher interest payment and greater cash taxes, we will have more cash available at the corporate level than prior to the transaction.", "I would also point out that we received $2.4 billion in cash flow in the quarter from the transaction to sell wireless licenses to T-Mobile. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.3 billion and we\u2019re $8.5 billion year-to-date up about $900 million or 11.5%. Wireless capital spending in the second quarter was $2.5 billion. And through the first half totaled $5.3 billion, well ahead of what we spent through the first half of last year.", "We are investing to proactively stay ahead of demand. As we\u2019ve said, our capital investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network primarily by increasing network density and the point spectrum. We are actively deploying AWS spectrum across our nationwide footprint and currently have more than 350 markets with AWSF or XLTE as we are branding it. The continued deployment of AWS and the addition of small sales distributed in terms of systems and the in building solutions will fortify our network advantage.", "In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in the quarter and $2.7 billion year-to-date which we\u2019re down $219 million or 7.4%. Our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business. Gross stat of just under $110 billion was essentially unchanged from the last quarter. Our Net Debt position improved to about $104 billion and the Net Debt to adjusted EBITDA Ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.4 times.", "Now let\u2019s move into review with the segments starting with Wireless on Slide 7.", "Our consistent investment in Wireless is the foundation of our success and drives our leadership in network quality, reliability and the overall customer experience. Our capital investment strategy is focused on adding capacity to the network to meet increasing 4G device adoption which will drive higher customer usage.", "As I highlighted earlier, we have an exceptional quarter of 4G Smartphone and tablet activations with increase in gross addition and upgrades. We also did an excellent job in terms of customer retention. The increase in device volume was driven by a combination of factors starting with the compelling value proposition of our new MORE Everything plans on our high quality 4G LTE network. As you know, we refresh our pricing in framework and value proposition in the first quarter.", "Within this plans, we are providing customers a choice between the traditional two years service contracts with subsidize devices of Verizon Edge where customers make monthly installment payments with their devices that receive discounted monthly service pricing. We are also driving 4G device adoption with attractive tablet offers. Our sales strategy in the second quarter dramatically improved customer growth which created strong minimum for us as we entered the second half of the year.", "Total Wireless revenues grew to $21.5 billion up 7.5%. Our service revenues grew 5.9% to $18.1 billion. This was the first full quarter of discounted service pricing for customers on Verizon Edge. A portion of the sequential decline in the rate of growth was due to the tradeoff between the lower service revenue and higher monthly equipment billings. The percentage of phone activations by customers choosing Edge increased to about 18% in the quarter up from about 13% in the first quarter.", "In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 6.8%. As I highlighted earlier, our service EBITDA margin was 50.3%, 50 basis point higher than a year ago. The estimated benefit to EBITDA in the quarter from Edge was not significantly different than in the first quarter due to the cumulative impact of service price discounts in the program.", "Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on Slide 8.", "Our service revenue growth was once again driven by 4G smartphone and tablet adoption as well as increased data usage. Retailed postpaid revenue per account or ARPA moved 4.7% which was down from 6.3% in the first quarter. Again, more than half of the decline in the rate of growth resulted from this being the first full quarter of discounted monthly service pricing from Edge.", "Since ARPA is calculated using service revenue, it does not capture the monthly equipment billings from customers on the Edge program. In the second quarter, monthly equipment billings totaled about $180 million which was significantly higher than the first quarter. We continued to see good additional device adoption within our customer accounts. We ended the second quarter with an average of 2.8 retail connections per account, an increase of 3.7%. About 55% of our 35.2 million postpaid accounts have subscribed to MORE Everything shared data plans. Increased usage per device and per account continues to drive step ups to higher data tiers.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on Slide 9.", "We ended the quarter with $104.6 million total retail connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection space reached $98.6 million and prepaid totaled just over $6 million. Postpaid gross additions in the quarter were significantly higher both sequentially and year-over-year. Our 4.2 million postpaid gross add were 18.1% higher than a year ago in terms of the gross add mix, more than half for smartphones at about 40% more internet devices primarily tablets.", "Our retail postpaid term rate of that 9.4% was much improved from the first quarter and only one basis point higher than the second quarter of last year. As we previously said, postpaid net additions were very strong and totaled 1.441 million up 900,000 sequentially at about 500,000 from last year.", "As I highlighted earlier, our postpaid net additions included 2.3 million new 4G devices. Within that total more than 1 million were 4G smartphones and 1.2 million were 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled a positive 304,000 as the 1 million new 4G smartphones were partially offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones.", "For the third straight quarter, we had company record setting tablet net adds. While 4G smartphones provide the highest value, tablets provide a very good incremental value through increased data consumption and lower churn at the account level. Tablets also have a lower cost subsidy than smartphones. We see tablet as the highly profitable growth opportunity with significant headroom in terms of further penetration. Our postpaid tablet base is only 5.4 million. So we have a great opportunity with these devices to generate growth in 2014 and beyond.", "Turning now to customer upgrades. Our postpaid upgrade rate increased sequentially to 7.1% for the quarter. Once again, these were high quality upgrades. About 90% of all upgrades in the quarter were smartphones. Consistent with our plan to drive 4G smartphone penetration about 1.4 million or 23% of our smartphone upgrades were from basic phones. About half of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve.", "Next, let\u2019s turn to Slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our continued progress in terms of 4G adoption and usage. Postpaid device activations which we include both gross adds and upgrades increased both sequentially and year-over-year. Second quarter activations totaled 11.1 million up 10.2%. Smartphone activations totaled 8.3 million, 92% of which were 4G.", "Our smartphone penetration increased to nearly 75% of our total phones. We ended the quarter with 63.5 million smartphones and about 69% of those were 4G. So we still have about 20 million 3G smartphones and almost 22 million basic phones in our base which provides us with a good upgrade opportunity. Our overall 4G device penetration continues to steadily increase. At the end of the second quarter nearly 55% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 33% a year ago.", "Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. Currently about 76% of total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. We carry more traffic on our Wireless network than any of our competitors. This network advantage continues to be acknowledged by national surveys from widely recognized third party organizations. More importantly, our own stringent drive testing shows that we are continuing to improve our network performance.", "Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 11.", "In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the second quarter, Consumer revenue growth was 5.3% making it eight consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 4%. Mass markets which includes small business grew 4.2%.", "FiOS now represents 75% of consumer revenue and we are sustaining strong double-digit revenue growth. In the second quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 13.4% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and Quantum penetration. We continue to see strong adoption of Quantum as 55% of our FiOS Internet customers subscribe to the higher speeds ranging from 50 to 500 megabits per second.", "We continue to enrich the customer value proposition and drive investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. We recently introduced FiOS Quantum TV with enhanced features and functionality in terms of storage, recording capabilities and control of content. While still in the early stages, we are pleased with the initial adoption of this differentiated TV viewing experience by existing and new customers.", "In our FiOS markets, we continue to focus on adding quality customers and generating profitable growth in a very competitive market environment. In Broadband, we added 139,000 new FiOS Internet customers in the second quarter and now have 6.3 million subscribers representing 40% penetration.", "Overall, net broadband subscribers in the quarter were a positive 46,000. In FiOS video, we added 100,000 new subscribers in the quarter. So we now have 5.4 million subscribers representing 35% penetration.", "During the quarter, we also converted about 70,000 customers from copper to fiber. This network initiative continues to be important as we systematically upgrade our network and provide higher quality of service.", "Aside from maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services which result in additional recurring revenue.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and review our overall Wireline segment revenue and profitability. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter, Global Enterprise revenue declined $70 million or 1.9%. Revenue declined in Legacy Transport Services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which are smaller in scale.", "Strategic Services which include Private IP, Ethernet, Datacenter, Cloud, Security and Managed Services, grew 3%. In our Global Wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $92 million or 5.5%.", "While we continue to see healthy demand for Ethernet services, positive growth continues to be more than offset by price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges.", "As I highlighted earlier, total Wireline growth turned positive this quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to see some fluctuation in year-over-year growth rates. We are making progress but are not satisfied, we have much more to do here. We are focused on continuous improvements particularly in driving operating efficiencies.", "Wireline EBITDA increased 4.9% and the EBITDA margin expanded 100 basis points in the quarter to 23.2%. We continue to target increased Wireline EBITDA and margin expansion in 2014. As Lowell and I have both stated we continually look for opportunities to streamline the business and monetize non-strategic assets. To that end, on July 1st, we closed the transaction for the sale of the unit within our public sector business with revenues of about $600 million in 2013. A majority of which was equipment.", "Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. As always, the foundation of our success is the steady and consistent investment in networks and platforms. These networks and platforms form the building blocks for the innovative products and services that will fuel our growth and improve the customer experience.", "Our Wireless and Wireline networks continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage. We had a strong first half of 2014, with consolidated revenue growth of 5.2% and 36% adjusted EBITDA margin representing 90 basis points of margin expansion.", "We continue to deliver high-quality double-digit earnings growth and we have a much stronger cash position with the full access to Wireless cash flows. We have great confidence heading into the second half of the year and we remain on track to achieve our revenue growth, margin expansion and capital spending targets for the year.", "We have strong momentum in Wireless and expect to build on that strength driving further penetration of 4G smartphones and tablets while extending our network leadership position in 4G LTE. In FiOS, we expect to drive higher penetration in existing markets, and continue to differentiate ourselves with the superior Quantum broadband and video products.", "In the Enterprise space, we will continue to aggressively market key platforms, demonstrating that we have a unique set of capabilities to provide for customer solutions. As always, we will remain extremely focused on profitable revenue growth and will continue to drive network and cost structure improvements, utilizing our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principles.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you, Fran. David, we\u2019re now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hey guys, thanks. So one in Wireless and one the Wireline, if I may. Wireless postpaid account growth reaccelerated on 2Q, what do you think drove that rebound on account growth? And you said you have some strong momentum. Can we expect to continue through the rest of the year? And then on Wireline revenue was positive for the first time in years and margins improved more than we expected. What should we look forward there going forward for both revenue and margins? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Hi. Thanks, Phil, good morning. On the account growth, look, I think it was a number of things. I think the key to us right now is I would center around customer choice. We are giving our customers the choice to select what best fits them whether it\u2019s the EDGE program or it\u2019s the legacy adoption of a subsidy model.", "And as you can see from a service revenue growth performance, we are really centered around driving the attachment rate of devices generating more data on the individual network. So we\u2019re attracting customers to our network based on its performance. You can tell from that a customer choice perspective, many of our customers selected to stay with the legacy subsidy model as, I as I said on my prepared remarks, our take rate was only 18% for the quarter.", "I know I said in the first quarter, I expected that to accelerate to 30% with the introduction of indirect channels and the competitive environment. But during the holiday season, we really stuck with our game of giving customers the choice of that Edge program, but we ran a lot of promotions around handsets related to Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day. And I think that drove significant traffic to our stores. So from here, you should expect the same thing going into the third quarter that we will continue to address that marketplace.", "As far as our base goes, we saw great progress in our base by really reducing the churn. And as I said before, we were going to systematically address our base and take care of the customers who are coming out of contract and we felt that would churn to go somewhere else, we proactively went after those customers and made sure that they were satisfied with their pricing model and with their experience. And I think that proved to be the right model for us.", "I think we also addressed our basic to smartphone customer base by having a very good quarter, this quarter, of 1.4 million phones from basic phones up into the 4G smartphone category and also 3G to 4G smartphones.", "So when you consolidate all of this with the excellent tablet growth quarter we had \u2013 and again, I think tablets are extremely good for the industry, not just for Verizon. And from an industry perspective, I think everybody will see the same thing that says, these tablets are lower subsidy, they reduce churn in the account level. So we see that when someone has a tablet in the account, their churn is lower than the overall churn of a normal customer base. This device drives incremental revenue from an access standpoint.", "But more importantly, I think, and I\u2019ll give you a data point here, these 4G tablets drive more usage on the network than a 3G smartphone. So when you consolidate that into an account level pricing arrangement, customers buy up because they\u2019re using more data. So this is all good.", "And then of course, as we mentioned in the beginning from a service revenue perspective and account growth, machine-to-machine is becoming at a more important role there. So I\u2019ll stop there, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have more questions around Wireless.", "From a Wireline perspective, I guess I would put it this way. FiOS continues to be the driver of the Wireline revenue growth, continue to center around our pricing actions on the FiOS platform, continue to innovate and move people into our Quantum Broadband which provides an incremental increase to us. We launched our \u2013", "Operator", "Michael Rollins from Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Thanks, good morning. Fran, if I could just ask a couple of questions. First on the Wireless side, with respect to phone ad, should that a follow some of the historical, I guess, you call it seasonality that you\u2019ve seen in the past where I think last year, you talked about increasing ad performance as you moved through each quarter?", "And on the strategic side, could you talk about maybe what else Verizon could consider from an asset optimization perspective and maybe just an update on how things like VDMS and connected car are doing? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Okay. Thanks, Michael. So on the phone and net adds, obviously, again, as I said, we came out strong during the marketing periods of Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s Day and normally, the second quarter is only better than the first quarter. I think that through this year of obviously for the back half of this year, we\u2019re going to have several dynamic devices come to market that will certainly fuel for the industry, a lot of opportunity for growth here.", "So I think from our perspective, we\u2019ll stay to our game plan. I\u2019m not going to predict at this point what net adds will be from our phone net add for the third quarter that has a lot around that the competitive environment and customer base, but I would anticipate that you\u2019ll see strong performance from Verizon Wireless.", "As far as our other strategic areas, so Verizon Digital Media Services launched their commercial service this year. We have a number of customers who are under contract and we\u2019re actually starting to generate revenue all from that platform. It\u2019s early stages here. There\u2019s a lot of opportunity within that platform and we will continue to move on that strategy.", "As far as Telematics goes, this goes into our machine-to-machine category. And as I said in my prepared remarks here, I will tell you, this was one of the highest connection quarters we had from a machine-to-machine on a companywide basis which would include Verizon Wireless, Hughes Telematics and some of our enterprise customers. And that fueled that 50% year-over-year growth. So machine-to-machine continues to be a critical component.", "I would also tell you, if you have a chance to visit one of our destination stores with Verizon Wireless, you immediately walk in a store and you can visually see all of the technology around gaming and music and fitness that can be connected to our network. And these things are being sold quite substantially on a quarterly basis through our Verizon Wireless distribution stores.", "So again, this is a very important category, I think, not only for us but for the industry. And as we\u2019ve continually said, we believe that machine-to-machine will be a future growth engine for us for years to come and that is consistent with our strategy.", "Michael Rollins \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay. David, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks very much, good morning. Fran, you talked about the strong cash flow in the quarter. It looks like there\u2019s an opportunity potentially for bonus depreciation to be extended again. You had $6 billion of cash on a balance sheet here. It looks like you\u2019re doing some refis on your balance sheet. Can you just talk about your overall financial strategy? It looked an opportunity here to delever a little bit more to refi, but there\u2019s also spectrum auctions coming in. And how that all place into dividend and policy given the 20% plus EPS growth? Is there an opportunity here despite the leverage to maybe see faster dividend growth? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Simon. So in a cash flow, yes. I mean, obviously, we have a significant strong cash flow here. And obviously, we said that at the onset of acquiring Verizon Wireless that we will get 100% ownership of those cash flows.", "As I said at the beginning of this year, look, the strategy right now for us is to build cash on the balance sheet to prepare for the AWS-3 auction that\u2019s coming in November and that\u2019s the strategic initiative we had moving into this year.", "So we have gross debt at about the same level. Now, that\u2019s been came down from a high of $114 billion when we closed the Vodafone transaction, that\u2019s at $110 billion. But you see us accumulating that cash on the balance sheet to prepare for the auction.", "As far as the overall refinancing of long-term debt here, you\u2019ve seen us to be very proactive in a marketplace taking the opportunity of the low interest rate market, repositioning the debt that we borrowed at the close and repositioning our towers. So we\u2019re strategically trying to push up the long-term debt longer at a more fixed lower rate than we had. And we will continue to work those towers into the future. I really won\u2019t talk about our future plans at this point. It would be inappropriate to do that.", "As far as bonus depreciation goes, look, I\u2019m optimistic but I\u2019m not because here we sit in July, there\u2019s not much activity moving around us. There\u2019s many things that the government has to deal with including the highway build that\u2019s pertinent to us because of pensions moving that\u2019s included in that bill. There\u2019s also the Internet Freedom Act that has to get passed or else consumers are going to be detrimented here at the end of this year.", "And then of course, we have the overall tax reform in bonus depreciation. So look, I think, we\u2019ll have to wait to see, but as the year runs out, bonus depreciation becomes less and less impactful.", "So we\u2019re hopeful that the government will do the right thing here to stimulate the economy and investment around this but it\u2019s hard for me to predict that. So at this point, we\u2019re not counting on any decrease in our federal tax payments because of bonus depreciation. And as I said at the beginning of the year, this was about $1 billion of incremental tax impact to us by not having that Bonus Depreciation.", "As far as dividend policy goes, look, I think we\u2019ve both Lowell and I have reiterate that we understand the dividend policy is important. Our Board of Directors understand the dividend policy is important but it is a Board of Director decision, so I can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what that policy will be. But we do understand it\u2019s important and I think we\u2019ve reflected our board has been very aggressive in our dividend policy over the last seven years and so I think that should set the stage for the future.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, we\u2019re ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden \u2013 Bank of America", "Hey, guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, two if I could. Just first, Fran, obviously there\u2019s a lot of focus on wireless service margin this quarter, from the comment of last quarter that there was next vacation that we\u2019re going to get a huge increase in the installment payment plan take rate. There was an equivalent expectation that we\u2019re going to get a lot of upfront revenue recognition and that would have helped the margins a lot. But that obviously didn\u2019t really take place. At 18% take rate, that probably gave you a couple of hundred million relative to street expectations.", "You said that the installment payment plan impact was about the same at this quarter as last quarter, but it was net of the service price discounts. Could you parse that out between the impact that you took from a cash perspective of giving lower prices versus the revenue benefit non-cash that you got from the upfront accounting related issues that going to the installment payment plan?", "And I guess, the second question would be more of a strategic one. I know you guys have been working on video and pushing video through the wireless network from a TV anywhere perspective buying content partnering people through the last couple of years. Could you talked a little bit about what the talk now of consolidation of the content environment, how your strategy is unfolding, how you\u2019re working to try to bring video content into the wireless environment so you can monetize it over to 4G network? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Good. Thanks, David. So as long \u2013 look, on the service margin, I think here\u2019s the way I would answer this is that we produced a 50.3% margin on extremely high volume growth under a subsidy model and I think that\u2019s the key for this quarter. So we really didn\u2019t get much benefit from the Edge program because the take rate was only 18%.", "We said that the billings around Edge were $180 million, so you can do the backwards math there. But if you look at the actual EBITDA impact of Edge I said was similar to the first quarter. As far as the pricing refresh that we did in the first quarter to respond to the competitive environment, again, there is some impact there from dilution on customers that are moving and that we are as I said addressing from a churn perspective. But this is all good for us because we maintain those customers on an appropriate plan. They stay with Verizon Wireless. They\u2019re adding tablets. They\u2019re increasing their ARPU again.", "So the way I would venture to say on this one without getting to too much math on service revenue pricing and so forth, if you take the $180 million and add that to the ARPA, I think you\u2019d come out with a number that\u2019s significantly higher than the 4.7% from a recurring revenue standpoint if you will. So I think from a 50.3% quarter based on the growth that we had on a subsidy model, I think it\u2019s just an outstanding quarter for us from an overall profitability on Verizon Wireless. So I\u2019ll stand on that one and leave it at that.", "As far as content goes, look, I think we\u2019ve demonstrated through our NFL agreement, some of our IndyCar agreement and some other agreements that we have around some sporting networks, that we will continue to search for those opportunities that make content available to our wireless customers without a linear TV or satellite TV subscription.", "And I think that\u2019s important for the wireless user as we see more and more of the younger generation are cutting the quarter in their home and want their content either via or the internet or wireless, that\u2019s the strategy that we hold. If you\u2019re asking me, do we need to own the content? We continue to position ourselves but we believe we do not need to own content to be successful in this ecosystem, but we just need to get the rights for that content. We understand that content providers want to be paid for those rights and as long as that\u2019s a worker commercial model for us then we will continue on that strategy.", "I\u2019d also highlight that one of the big things here that\u2019s coming to market is of course Multicast which will really enhance the experience for our customers around watching video and also extremely efficient for the wireless industry to provide that video through their network without consuming a lot of spectrum and a lot of capacity. So we will start to embed chips in our handsets here, the back half for this year.", "The network will be ready by the end of the third quarter to actually launch Multicast. We won\u2019t go commercial with that until \u201815, but the network will be ready and it\u2019s a matter of getting the handsets in customers\u2019 hands and then obviously getting the content which we demonstrated with the Super Bowl this past January.", "For those types of the events that we think will be very, very really consumed by the consumer on real time live type events. So more to come around the whole video strategy of Wireless but I think the breakthrough point here will be once Multicast technology is up and running and launched.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, David, we\u2019ll take the next question now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Great, thanks, guys. Fran, can you give us a sense of what percentage of your postpaid base takes a 10 gigabyte or larger bucket and maybe how that\u2019s changed over time? Just trying to get a sense of the up strategy some more tablets into the base. And then on the Wireline side, that\u2019s more of the follow up. You saw a 100 basis points year-over-year improvement in margins but you didn\u2019t talk about somewhat that one time that drove the revenue, did that also affect the margins or is this 100 basis point improvement sort of a good run rate for what you can expect for the second half of the year? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, John. So first, on the 10 gigabit plan, we don\u2019t disclose where our customers sit within the bands. But what I will tell you is it that we have quarter-to-quarter over the last three quarters seen an increased in the amount of customers taking the 10 gigabit plan and pricing up.", "So we watched on a quarterly basis the number of customers that buy down in data bundles and buy up in data bundles and that over the last several quarters we\u2019ve had a significant net positive in buying up in data bundles. So from that perspective the takeaway will be is that we continue to see an increase in customers buying up in their data bundles and that includes the 10 gigabit plan.", "As far as the Wireline margin, look, we\u2019ve said from the beginning of this year, Lowell and I were very opportunistic on increasing the Wireline margin. Now some of this is seasonality. Second quarter is always good. Third quarter tends to have some seasonality into it. But look, overall I think you should see that we are moving the Wireline business in the right direction from a profitability standpoint.", "And there are a lot of things that we still need to work on obviously. As I\u2019ve said FiOS is the big driver on the top line, copper migration continues to be an important strategic initiative for us. But I don\u2019t want to down plate the fact that our VLSS, we\u2019ve been at this for two years and we\u2019re now starting to see the benefits of a lot of these projects around efficiencies and cost cutting starting to come through.", "So again, that is part of this, you should see us improve our productivity especially around the new Quantum TV where we can put a media server into the home and start to get some real efficiencies in the install process and we think that will happen entering in 2015.", "So again, I think that\u2019s part of it. The other thing too is this that we can\u2019t lose side of the fact that we continue to look at this portfolio and as I\u2019ve said in my prepared remarks we did divest of a branch of our public sector business which was about $600 million of revenue that last year.", "You will see the impact of that going into the third quarter. So we will lose that revenue in third quarter, so that\u2019s going to show up in our public sector business. But from an overall margin standpoint, that\u2019s going to help the profitability of this company. And this is again looking at non-strategic businesses that are what I would say is not our niche in the business and we need to divest to them. And Lowell and I continue to look at things that we can divest of that are best for overall shareholder value. And we will continue with that.", "John Hodulik \u2013 UBS", "Great, thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Fran Shammo", "Mike, are you on mute?", "Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Can you hear me?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, now I can. Go ahead.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Sorry about that. Yes, Fran, just thinking about the net add numbers, the 2.3 million 4G LTE postpaid versus the 1.4 overall. Can you just sort of map us through that, what you\u2019re saying as far basic and features phone sub losses or migration? You talked about migrations, but you\u2019re saying is more pressure standpoint from the competitors. And then secondly on FiOS and these targeted MDUs more recently, what you\u2019re saying with their expected changing video behaviors among that youth demographic, maybe just a comment on what kind of returns you guys get on a broadband only sub? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Okay, let me start with the MDU side. So from an MDU perspective, look, these continues to be one of our strong penetration gains. And as I\u2019ve said before, New York City is still our lowest penetrated market but it is our highest year-over-year gain. And a lot of this has to do with MDUs. But this is a \u2013 it\u2019s a challenging business because the average tenant of an MDU in New York, I think the last time I looked was eight months.", "So these units change and of course the strategy, part of the strategy is to accumulate the new residence coming in to continue to use the FiOS demand. But obviously within this younger generation, a year ago, we tested the ability to have them select whether they wanted large TV bundles and lower Internet speeds or high Internet speeds and lower TV bundles. And what we saw is the majority of this said does this segment selected the highest speed that they could get and didn\u2019t really care about how many TV stations they got because most of them are consuming their video via Internet.", "Again, this is just another position for us of why we\u2019ve gone the symmetry within our broadband offers. We just launched that this week, so you will see that heading the consumer market which symmetry on all of our broadband offers. We launched it six months ago in our small business segment, so this is again another strategy which we think is important for that generation who really wants the highest speed that they can get and they want the symmetry in that speed. So that will continue to be an overall concentration for us.", "As far as the handsets and all, look, I think that you can probably do the backwards map here and we said that we added 2.3 million 4G, LTE phones overall. We\u2019ve said that we had million 4G smartphones net adds for the quarter. So with the 304,000 net number the majority of those losses were basic phones and then the rest were made with 3G.", "So again, you can see that the basic phone category or I would consider this to lower end phone category continues to be the category that we lose but I will say that we made substantial improvement from what we saw on the first quarter with all the pricing actions, the retention tools that we put in place and some of the new pricing tools that we put in place.", "Overall, I think we significantly improved and that came through on the operating results of Verizon Wireless.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Hey, Fran, just a quicky on the EIP, could you just give us a sense for how that paced through the quarter? Was it accelerating throughout? And then what should we think about for the full year on the EIP uptake? What\u2019s your expectation?", "Fran Shammo", "I think I would put it this way. What I saw was in our store channel, it was pretty much relatively flat. The increase came through the indirect channel when we launched that. Right now I would say that I think one important piece of information here as well is that on the front line our sales representatives make the same compensation whether they sell on Edge plan or a legacy subsidy model.", "There was no difference in their compensations. So again, this comes down to the important ingredient that this is truly a customer choice. The rep shows them both models and the customer chooses.", "So as far as going forward, look, I think that we are on pace to be somewhere between this 18% to 20% but again, when you think about all of the new phones that are coming in the back half of the year through the indirect channel, this could escalate a bit on us. The competitive environment has a lot to do with this. But right now under current course and current environment, I think that the 18% to 20% is really where we sit.", "Mike McCormack \u2013 Jefferies LLC", "Great, thanks Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Kevin Smithen on Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie", "Thanks. With Edge adoption at just 18%, the fall in year-over-year seems to imply a repricing of non-Edge base. I think you said you had some churn mitigation promotions in the quarter. Can you talk a little bit about that and also where do you expect year-over-year ARPA stabilize?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes. So I think Kevin as I\u2019ve said at the beginning, I think you have to do a little of backwards math here because the Edge plan if you take that 180 million billing number that I gave you and you look at ARPA, I think what you\u2019ll see is if you calculate back in the returning monthly and equipment revenue which in essence would have been service revenue, I think your percentage increase would be relatively flat with the first quarter and some past quarters. So, again I think that the service revenue impact and the ARPA impact is really Edge-related.", "Now, there is some of course service pricing discounts in there and we are moving as we said proactively some of our customers who are out of contract and we think that they have a high propensity to churn. We are proactively moving them to the Edge pricing. But we\u2019re doing this very, very systematically. And so there will be a little bit of pressure there, but I think if you do that backwards math that I gave you, I think you\u2019ll get to the true numbers of what the ARPA growth would have been with this recurring equipment revenue in it.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie", "And how should we think about the AWS refinancing? Will this be an additional capital raise or funded out of cash on-hand and how should we think about your sort of leverage targets with the spectrum auction? And it sounds like you want to be very aggressive with that.", "Fran Shammo", "Well I think the way you want to think about this is it is an auction. So I\u2019m not going to talk about how we think we\u2019re going to pay for that auction because I\u2019m not going to give anybody information of how much I\u2019m willing to spend for the auction. So I think we\u2019ll just wait there. As I said, the strategy is to build cash, prepare for the auction and we\u2019ll execute accordingly. So more to come on that in the latter back of the year.", "Kevin Smithen \u2013 Macquarie", "Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Oh, great, thanks. Two if I may. First, just in terms of the outlook on the top line for the remainder of the year and you guys have had a very strong first half of the year up almost 6% revenue growth year-over-year in the second quarter. And the outlook for the year is only about 4%. I\u2019m wondering if that is just conservative stance at this point in the year or if there\u2019s something that we should look out for in particular as we examine our back half for the year projections. And then yet another question around EIP. I\u2019m just wondering if we could get a census to where the receivable currently stood or maybe the change in receivable over quarter-over-quarter. Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Sure. Thanks, Jonathan. So on the 4%, look, being the CFO, we generally are conservative. So I\u2019ll stick to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year which was top line growth of 4% plus, so I\u2019ll stick to that. As far as the balance sheet goes, if you look at our balance sheet, the change in the AR is directly related to the Edge program, so you can look at that change and pretty much come to your answer.", "Jonathan Schildkraut \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Thank you for taking the questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, last question?", "Operator", "Your last question today will come from Jennifer Fritzsche from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer Fritzsche \u2013 Wells Fargo", "Great, thank you for taking the question. Fran, you have mentioned a lot about the AWS-3 auction. I know there\u2019s a lot of complications and a lot of blurriness around it. But I\u2019ve not heard you talk openly about the broadcast or incentive auction. Your closest peer obviously made a big monetary number, put a monetary number with that. And I just was wondering your current thought as you stand here today.", "Fran Shammo", "Yes. So thanks, Jennifer. So look \u2013 I mean we are focused on AWS-3 auction and the reason we\u2019re focused on that is it will start November 13th, deposits will be required. We actually know exactly what the rules are. The procedures for that auction will be announced sometime in the next coming weeks. So that\u2019s really the focal point for us. As far as the broadcast spectrum goes, look, currently there are no final adoptive rules on this. So it\u2019s hard for us to sit here and make a comment on something that has not been finalized. So I think that would be premature for us.", "I know what others have done, but look we are focused on AWS. We\u2019ll get through that. We\u2019ll see what the broadcast spectrum final rules are and then you\u2019ll hear more from us when that happens. But at this point, I\u2019m not going to make anymore comments around the broadcast.", "Michael Stefanski", "That\u2019s all time we have for questions for today. But before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Mike. Just a couple of quick closing comments. So look we had an extremely strong first half of 2014 in terms of our buy-in growth and financial performance. Importantly, we closed the Vodafone transaction and now have sole ownership of the Wireless asset.", "To the first half of this year, we have exceeded our revenue growth targets and delivered strong earnings growth. We have great momentum heading into the second half and we are competing well in all of our key strategic areas. Our cash generation is very strong and we have great confidence in our ability to execute on our strategy and grow this business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future. We are excited about our growth opportunities and we will continue to invest, innovate and deliver for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.", "Thank you so much for joining us today and have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. (Operator instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, David. Good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I\u2019m here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer.", "As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we\u2019ve posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in this presentation are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential. ", "In terms of our financial results, I\u2019ll point out that there were no special items included in our reported earnings for the third quarter of 2014. Earnings per share of $0.89 compares with adjusted earnings of $0.77 per share in the third quarter of last year, an increase of 15.6%. On a year-to-date basis, adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 were up 21.6%. Keep in mind that the $2.65 per share a year-to-date result in 2014 does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of the year since the transaction close on February 21.", "As previously noted full ownership from January 01, to the date of closing would have represented an additional $0.07 of earnings per share in the first quarter. For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the business within the public sector that we sold on July 01 have been reclassified for all periods prior to the sale. These results, which previously were part of global enterprise, have been moved to corporate and other, consistent with how we\u2019ve dealt with divested operations in the past. You can access this reclassified historical information on our website. ", "With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Mike, good morning everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate the consistency of our performance and our ability to compete effectively and deliver strong operating and financial results. We entered the year with great confidence in our ability to generate strong financial performance in 2014 and our conviction has not changed. We believe that steady and consistent investments in networks and platforms will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth. Our Wireless and Wireline networks will continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we build our competitive advantage.", "The overall industry is very healthy and we continue to see strong customer demand for Wireless and broadband services. U.S. market has set the pace for global broadband infrastructure investments. In Wireless, all four national service providers are investing in 4G networks resulting in continued innovation, 4G device adoption and increase in customer usage. Our competitive position is strong and we\u2019re focused on executing our strategy of providing a compelling value proposition and a great customer experience on the best most reliable network.", "In the third quarter, we produced very strong customer growth in Wireless and FiOS and sustained our strong growth trends in terms of revenue and earnings. We pride ourselves on being an \u201cand\u201d company, delivering quality growth and profitability. We continue to stand apart from our peers with very consistent high quality earnings results. We have posted double-digit year-over-year growth in reported and adjusted earnings and earnings per share in 10 of last 11 quarters. ", "In Wireless, we had a very strong quarter of high quality connections growth and profitability. Retail postpaid device activations of 11.7 million were up 14.9%. This is higher volume than the fourth quarter last year, when we activated 11.5 million devices. Retail postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million up 63.5% from last year. Year-to-date postpaid net adds of 3.5 million were up 37.4%, which is roughly 1 million more than a year-ago. ", "Our Wireless EBITDA service margin was 49.5%. This is a very strong result given the volume of device activations and the relatively low percentage of customers choosing the Edge program in the quarter. ", "In Wireline, we had a strong quarter in FiOS with 162,000 internet and 114,000 video net subscriber addition. Consumer revenues grew 4.5%. As we continue to drive FiOS penetration and customer adoption of our quantum broadband and video products. Our Wireline EBITDA margin remained stable at 23%. Our strong cash generation enables us to consistently invest in our networks for future growth and return value to our shareholders. Through the first nine months of 2014, we have invested $12.6 billion of capital and paid $5.7 billion in dividend. ", "In early September, we were pleased to announce that our Board of Directors approved a 3.8% dividend increase which raises our annual dividend to $2.20 per share. This is the 8th consecutive year that our Board has approved a quarterly dividend increase and the highest percent increase since 2008. ", "Now let\u2019s get into the third quarter performance in more detail starting with the consolidated results on Slide 4. On a reported basis total operating revenue grew 4.3% in the third quarter. If we exclude the revenues of the public sector business we divested from the prior period, the comparable growth rate would have been 4.9% from the third quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. ", "Our consolidated top-line growth continues to be driven primarily by Wireless and FiOS. In addition to top-line growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six-Sigma program. Consolidated EBITDA was $11.1 billion in the quarter and our EBITDA margin was 35%. ", "Let\u2019s take a look at our cash flow results on Slide 5. As I have noted in prior quarters, it is important to remember that the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless create a lack of comparability between the current and prior period in our state in the cash flow. The first nine months of 2014, cash flow from operations were $23.2 billion. Additional cash outlays this year included $2.5 billion of incremental cash interest payments and higher cash income taxes of $3.2 billion. In addition, we had $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not make in 2013. In spite of these additional cash outlets and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $10.5 billion through the end of September. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $4.1 billion and were $12.6 billion year-to-date up $817 million or 6.9%. ", "We project that capital spending will be around $17 billion for the full year. Our deployment of capital in Wireless has been very consistent throughout the first three quarters of this year. In the third quarter, Wireless CapEx was $2.5 billion and trough nine months totaled $7.8 billion. We are deploying capital to proactively stay ahead of demand and our capital investments continue to focus on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density and deploying spectrum. We have been actively deploying AWS spectrum across our nationwide footprint, and currently have more than 400 markets with AWS or XLTE as we branded it. Our continued deployment of spectrum along with investments in small sales, distributed antenna systems and in building solutions will allow us to build upon our network advantage. ", "In Wireline, capital expenditures totaled $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion year-to-date, down $273 million or 6.1%. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. Gross debt of $109.2 billion was down $750 million from last quarter. Our net debt position improved to $102 billion and then net debt to adjusted-EBITDA ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.3 times. ", "Now let\u2019s move into the review of the segment, starting with Wireless on Slide 6. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. This value proposition includes customer choice and an excellent service experience on the nation\u2019s most reliable network. Our investment strategy is focused on adding capacity to our network to meet increasing demand, which is driven by 4G device adoption and higher customer usage.", "Growth in Wireless revenue and profitability continues to be driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base, where we continue to see very strong 4G device adoption. As I highlighted earlier, we had another exceptional quarter of smartphone and tablet activations. Customer demand on our network continues to increase at a rapid pace. Our recently announced promotional pricing is designed to provide even greater appeal to our MORE Everything plan which we believe will drive more 4G device adoption and stimulate incremental usage on our more efficient LTE network.", "We expect that continued success in driving 4G device activations in the fourth quarter will create profitable growth for us as we enter 2015 and beyond. Total Wireless revenues in the quarter grew to $21.8 billion up 7%. Service revenues grew 4.8%, driven by 4G LTE connections growth and higher usage on our network. The declining rate of service revenue growth is attributable to device mix, price changes and the tradeoff between lower service revenue and higher monthly equipment billings for customers on Verizon Edge.", "In the third quarter the percentage of phone activations by customers choosing Edge program was approximately 12%, which was down from about 18% in the second quarter based on recent promotional pricing for Edge, the percentage of phone activations taking the installment plan option could more than double in the fourth quarter. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and our service EBITDA margin was 49.5%. The EBITDA benefit in the quarter from the Edge program was approximately $115 million.", "Let\u2019s now turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account beginning on slide 7. Retail postpaid revenue per account or ARPA grew 3.5% in the quarter; growth in ARPA is a function of device adoption, accounts growth and increased usage. The continued rapid pace of 4G device adoption is improving the quality of our customer accounts. In the third quarter, we added 4.4 million 4G smartphones and 1.1 million 4G tablets to our postpaid connection space. All of the important account metrics are improving. We ended the quarter with a total of 35.4 million postpaid accounts and the number of postpaid connections per account was 2.82, which is an increase of 3.7%. 57% of our accounts are on MORE Everything share data plan. The average data usage in MORE Everything accounts has increased nearly 50% year-over-year. ", "I would also point out that since the ARPA metrics is calculated using service revenue, it does not capture the monthly equipment billings from customers on the Edge program. In the third quarter these monthly equipment billings totaled about $285 million and were approximately $533 million year-to-date. ", "Let\u2019s take a closer look in connections growth on slide 8. We ended the quarter with 106.2 million total retail connections, our industry leading postpaid connections base top the 100 million mark at 100.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million.", "In passing the 100 million postpaid connections milestone, it is worth noting that we\u2019ve added more than 20 million new connections since 2009, representing a compound annual growth rate of around 5%. Postpaid growth has totaled 4.5 million in the quarter up from 4.2 million in the second quarter and 3.7 million a year ago. Year-to-date postpaid gross adds were up 15.1% in terms of the gross add mix in the third quarter 54% were smartphones and about 36% were connected devices primarily tablet. Most of the remaining gross adds were basic phones.", "Our retail postpaid churn rate of 1% was 3 basis points higher than the third quarter of last year. As I highlighted earlier, retail postpaid net adds in the quarter totaled 1.5 million compared with 1.4 million in the second quarter and 927,000 a year ago. Our postpaid net add mix in the quarter included 2.3 million new 4G devices. Within that total, 1.2 million were 4G smartphones and 1.1 million were 4G tablets. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 457,000 which is comparable to 481,000 in the third quarter last year.", "Within the postpaid phone category, the 1.2 million new 4G smartphone adds were partially offset by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones. Tablet net adds were more than 1 million for the second consecutive quarter. Tablets provide good growth to increase data consumption, lower churn of the account level and have a lower cost subsidies in the smartphones. We have significant headroom in terms of further penetration as our postpaid tablet base was 6.5 million at the end of the quarter. Further customer adoption of tablets clearly represents an incremental growth opportunity for us. ", "Our postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2% in the third quarter. Once again, these were high quality smartphone upgrades either from a basic phone 3G to 4G or 4G to a newer 4G smartphones, about 1.2 million were 18% of smartphone upgrade this quarter were from basic phones, nearly 50% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G which we monetized through higher data usage and lower cost to serve.", "You will recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012, we activated 3.1 million 3G iPhones as it was the first time we offered a free apple device to customers signing a new two-year contract. A majority of these customers will be coming off contract this quarter providing us with a unique opportunity to try 4G smartphone adoption, almost all of our retail connections growth in 2014 have been postpaid. The first nine months prepaid net adds were only 5000 compared with 274,000 in 2013, we believe that price sensitive prepaid customers are moving to the postpaid market.", "Next, let\u2019s turn to the Slide 9 and take a look at the device activations and our continued progress in driving 4G adoption and usage. As I have highlighted, postpaid device activations were very strong at 11.7 million. During the quarter, we activated 8.9 million smartphones and 1.3 million tablets. Our smartphone penetration at the end of the quarter increased to 77% of total phones. We have 65.4 million smartphones in total and 48.2 million of them are 4G. A year ago, we had 29 million 4G smartphones that we\u2019ve made significant progress in driving 4G penetration and yet we still have a significant opportunity in front of us with more than 17 million 3G smartphones and 20 million basic phones in our connections space.", "Beyond smartphones, tablets and other internet devices are contributing to our overall 4G device penetration. At the end of the third quarter, more than 59% of our retail postpaid connections were 4G, up from 38% a year ago. Data and video usage on our network continues to rise. Currently about 79% of our total data traffic is carried on the 4G LTE network. As we handle this increased demand, our network continues to be acknowledged as the performance leader and national studies conducted by widely recognized third party organizations. We have raised our own network standards and our performance continues to get better.", "Let\u2019s move next to our Wireline segment starting with a review our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In the third quarter, consumer revenue growth was 4.5%, making it 9 consecutive quarters of growth in excess of 4%. Mass market which includes small business grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 76% of consumer revenue and we\u2019re sustaining strong double-digit revenue growth. In the third quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 12.3% driven by customer additions, pricing actions and quantum penetration.", "Strong adoption of quantum continued at 57% of our FiOS internet customers described of higher speed ranging from 50 megabytes to 500 megabytes per second. We continue to enrich the customer value proposition and drive investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. In the second quarter, we introduced FiOS quantum TV with enhanced features and functionality in terms of storage, recording capabilities and control of content. In July, we introduced Speed Match, a service upgrade that increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds. This competitive advantage provides FiOS customers with faster and more consistent upload speeds, which is compelling for social media and gaming activities.", "Our focus in FiOS markets is to drive higher penetration by adding quality customers, generating profitable growth in a very competitive market and improving our overall investment returns. In broadband, we added 162,000 net FiOS internet customers in the quarter and now have 6.5 million subscribers representing 40.6% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers in the third quarter were up positive 69,000, up more than 23%. In FiOS video, we added 114,000 net subscribers that we now have 5.5 million subscribers representing 35.5% penetration.", "During the quarter, we converted 55,000 customers from copper to fiber bringing our year-to-date total to around 200,000. This network evolution initiative is enabling us to systemically upgrade the network and provide higher quality of service to customer. Beside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customer to purchase FiOS services which resulted in additional recurring revenue. ", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover the enterprise and wholesale business. In the enterprise space we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined $155 million or 4.4%. Revenue declines in legacy transport services and CPE continue to outweigh growth in newer and more strategic applications which were smaller in scale. Strategic services totaled $2.1 billion and grew 1%. This category, as currently defined, includes both the IP layer and application such as data center, cloud, security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer have been impacted by competitive price compression which is offsetting growth in application services. ", "In our global wholesale business, quarterly revenues declined $79 million or 4.8%. Healthy demand for Ethernet services in each of last few quarters has offset a larger portion than expected as the revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges. In the third quarter, Wireline operating expenses declined 1.7% and our EBITDA margin was 23%. As we said, we are making progress but are not satisfied. We have more work to do in order to drive improved profitability in this segment. On a year-to-date basis, the Wireline EBITDA margin was up 60 basis points to 23%. From an overall segment perspective, our strategy is to continue scaling our FiOS business and improve the enterprise revenue mix by driving growth in the newer strategic services like cloud and security.", "In addition, we believe that process improvements and retooling efforts using Verizon Lean Six-Sigma principle will improve our cost structure and drive operating efficiency, resulting in a stronger Wireline business. ", "Let\u2019s move next to our summary slide. With three quarters of 2014 behind us, our financial performance has been strong. We continue to deliver high quality double-digit earnings growth and our cash generation is strong, enhanced by full access to all the Wireless cash flows. These cash flows have allowed us to consistently invest in our networks and platforms for future growth and innovation. In addition, we returned value to shareholders with the 3.8% dividend increase. We have a strong market position and that demonstrated the ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. ", "Our high quality customer base in Wireless and Wireline continue to be the hallmark of our brand and provides the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage. We are also building for the future through our global platforms in video delivery and machine-to-machine. New revenue streams from machine-to-machine in Telematics are beginning to emerge. In the third quarter these revenues were approximately $150 million and totaled more than $400 million through nine months, an increase of more than 40% year-to-date. ", "Our strong volume growth in both Wireless and FiOS gives us great confidence heading into the fourth quarter. We continue to target consolidated revenue growth of 4% in 2014. For the full year, our consolidated adjusted-EBITDA margin as well as the Wireless EBITDA service margin results will be dependent on fourth quarter volumes and Edge installment plan take rates. The Wireline EBITDA margin remains on track to expand on a full year basis. ", "With that I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions. ", "Michael Stefanski", "", "Thank you, Fran. Before taking questions I would like to remind everyone that we filed an application to participate in the AWS-3 spectrum auction. As a result due to the FCC\u2019s rules, we cannot answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. David we are now ready to take questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) One moment for the first question. Your first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden - Bank of America", "", "Hey guys thanks for taking the question. So two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit in light of Lowell\u2019s comments in the briefing about his conviction level, confidence level about 4Q. About the Cadence Competition and how you felt you had to respond over the course of the quarter, obviously things started off fairly stable and then we have the T-Mobile promotion followed by the Sprint promotion followed by incremental actions in terms of double data and things like that. So if you kind of give us a sense us to how the quarter trended and what you are seeing that\u2019s giving you the confidence for the rest of the fourth quarter would be helpful. ", "And then second Fran, I think that we have got a pretty good understanding that Smartphone customers have been generating roughly double the value of feature phone customers. You are referencing the 4G Smartphone opportunity is beings something incremental to the 3G Smartphone opportunity. If you could put some numbers around that, that would be super helpful. Thank you so much.", "Fran Shammo", "", "Okay, great. Thanks David. So look on the competitive front. I think that the takeaway here is just that we provide an extremely strong quarter from growth perspective and I anticipate you\u2019re going to see that across the industry.", "If you look at as I said we see a shift from prepaid to postpaid not necessarily within our base because of high quality and strict requirements we have from a credit perspective. But there is still a lot of growth out there. If you look at just the industry itself I mean you take tablets, you take the video consumption, you look at machine-to-machine and internet of things, I mean all these things are contributing to our growth. If you look at machine-to-machine for us it\u2019s the first time we gave you a revenue number and that\u2019s growing to 40% year-over-year. So it\u2019s more than just about a smartphone customer as I said before if I could I would stop disclosing net adds, it\u2019s all about how we build the base of revenue and how we continue to grow this business into the future.", "If you look at the competitive front, there was a lot of movement but it was not unexpected I mean as you go into the fourth quarter, this is normally a very high competitive quarter, it\u2019s a very high volume quarter for ourselves from a holiday perspective but I think if you look at us as we\u2019ve done in the past we look at what the competition is doing, we take a very rational and logical approach to what we\u2019re going to respond to? If you looked at what we did, we responded with some Edge pricing on a promotional basis that quite honestly puts us back into the market given all the moves we were slightly out of the market like if you saw it back in the first quarter of this year we did similar things and we continue to grow and we continue to produce the profitability that\u2019s expected of our shareholders.", "So, I think the response you\u2019ve seen is a logical rational response, there will be upcoming promotions I\u2019m sure from everyone as the holiday season gets closer and we have our own plans in place to execute on. So I think from a fourth quarter perspective, you should expect high volume, you should expect from us that our upgrade rate will increase, we have the highest backlog of any previous launch of an iPhone that we have coming into the fourth quarter, which is a high backlog of both new customers and also for upgrades. So I know that our upgrade rate is going to be fairly significant in the fourth quarter as we said on the call here 3.1 million, 2012 3G iPhone customers are waiting to upgrade now as they come out of contracts so that\u2019s a great perspective and that leads me into your second question.", "So if you think about some of the data points we have given you from a 3G smartphone customer to a 4G smartphone customer, the first time we\u2019ve told you that within our MORE Everything plan which is for the majority 4G smartphone customers. Their usage pattern is going up 50% year-over-year. If you look at tablets, a tablet customer uses more than the 3G smartphone customer. So if you start taking together with the volume increases and other industries have put out what the usage pattern of video customers are on a 4G LTE network, video is a huge consumption for us and it continues to increase quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year and that\u2019s driving that 50% increase in usage in our 4G base.", "So when you combine all of that, every time we can move a customer from a 3G smartphone or a basic phone into our 4G portfolio, their usage and revenue goes up. So it\u2019s a great combination for us. And I\u2019ll end the question that says, again we\u2019re focused on the quality of our base and the quality of our adds to generate our growth.", "Michael Stefanski ", "", "Thank you, David. David will ready for the next question.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan; please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick - JPMorgan", "", "Hi guys, thanks. Two things one to follow up, Fran something you just said prepaid customers move into the postpaid market is that a good thing or bad thing, do you think these customers offer a similar churn level that pass the credit check. Right? And did they tend to bring their own devices or they taking Edge to the different rate from one feasibility you have and then second there has been a lot of articles written likely on asset sales from you whether that was Wireline assets or towers. Can you give us an update on how you\u2019re thinking about that? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "", "Thanks Phil. On the prepaid customer move to postpaid look I mean, we\u2019re just looking at the overall industry and where prepaid growth is from a year ago to where it is today and the assumption is that we do we see the prepaid customer moving. If you look at the entry prices now that are on postpaid and this is really around single line not multifamily. But if you look at single line pricing, those price points are pretty darn close to what a prepaid customer would pay on prepaid. So the hurdle is there is a credit check and obviously for Verizon we\u2019ve not changed our credit profile for any of our customers it\u2019s same as it has been for over a year now even when Edge was introduced.", "So, again it\u2019s not as favorable to us it was more of where are these customers going and we think they are going to a lower end type entry point which is not unusual. I mean the same thing happened back in the Voice world when Voice became closer to what the prepaid were. So, from a device perspective some is on device but others are also buying up into device. ", "As far as the asset sales go, look I\u2019ve nothing to announce today. We said publically that we certainly would entertain a sale of our towers if the terms and conditions were right. And at this point, we don\u2019t have anything there. And as Lowell and I\u2019ve always said, we continue to look at our portfolio for opportunities but it has to be at the right time, the right place, and the right price and so therefore there is really nothing to talk further because there is nothing to announce.", "Michael Stefanski ", "David next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks for taking the question. I just want to maybe a follow-up on the full year margin guidance, it sounds like and correct me if wrong, but it sounds like it\u2019s most sensitive to the Edge take rate and so along those lines in the past you\u2019ve been fairly agnostic or you\u2019ve seen somewhat agnostic as to whether your customers were choosing a subsidy or choosing Edge. I am wondering how you\u2019re changing your thought process, meaning are you trying to achieve desire outcome. You noted that it looks like the take rate could double in the fourth quarter and then just broad levels, is there a breaking point? Meaning if Edge were to see adoption rate above a certain level you probably will have margins that were up and if that was below they probably be down just sort of help us with the modeling exercise?", "Fran Shammo ", "So look, there is a bunch of factors entering into the fourth quarter here. As I said, we do think that the Edge rate will take an uptick and you\u2019ve probably seen us increasing our advertising around the price points of Edge which is where the rest of the industry has been and advertising around. So we need to be in market with those price points which is why we launched the promotional pricing that you saw. But if you look at the 12% this quarter or the 18% last quarter, you can kind of get a flavor on what the impact is to our bottom line, which is 120 basis points this quarter. I think it was 134 basis points last quarter.", "So beyond that I am not going to give any further information on that, but if you think about the Edge take rate at the double then you can kind of extrapolate what that math would be, but then offsetting that will be the upgrades. And at this point, I don\u2019t know where the upgrade will come whether it will be Edge or onto the old subsidy model. Again, we\u2019re very focused on customer choice, we give our customers the choice of the subsidized handset with the higher service pricing or we give them the edge which they pay for the phone over the term, but it gives them the availability to upgrade sooner.", "So it is the customer choice and it\u2019s hard for me to identify what that will be. But as I said, Brett, we have a very high volume of backlog on the iPhone. We have a bunch of new phones coming out in the fourth quarter from other manufacturers that are extremely good. So I think we\u2019ll have a great lineup of products. It\u2019s going to be a high volume, highly competitive time of the year and beyond that I\u2019m not going to give any specific guidance to margins but it will certainly be based on those volumes and how those customers come in.", "Michael Stefanski ", "David next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley", "Fran, you\u2019ve talked about a $17 billion number for CapEx, you're coming towards to the end of the ex-LTE rollout, is there some opportunity for the -- it seems like the growth rate have slowed but some CapEx as a percent of revenues to fall over the coming quarters or are we going to continue keeping at this sort of rate as a percentage of revenues? And the on the Wireline side, a bit of softness in SMB and enterprise, you\u2019ve talked about some of the secular factors, do you detect any change in macro or in the competitive environment or is it just more of the same?", "Fran Shammo", "So on CapEx, we said we\u2019d be around $17 billion. As we\u2019ve said that coming into this year, we were determined to improve our CapEx to revenue ratio and I believe we will do that on a year-over-year basis. This year we had a much more flatness to our CapEx spending, so if you look at prior year we\u2019ve always had more of a ramp into the back half of the year. You won\u2019t see that this year, so it\u2019s become more level and I do anticipate that we\u2019ll be able to continue to improve on our CapEx-to-revenue ratio. As far as whole dollars go, we set around the $17 billion mark and I\u2019ll give you some more guidance in January, but I don\u2019t anticipate that that will change pretty materially going into the next year. So again, the focus will be to continue to increase that CapEx-to-revenue ratio. ", "And then on the Wireline side, first let\u2019s talk about the consumer small business area, so we did have an inflexion point this quarter where we did suffer a 4.1% decline in the small business and some of that was due a year-over-year comparison but some of that due to some onetime things and I think that will come back in line here in the fourth quarter. But we did have a very good strong FiOS quarter at 4.5%. The other thing I would say around FiOS is, if you look at the components of content and our revenue per customer, our revenue per customer is growing nicely and is actually outpacing the cost of content. And this year, if you look at our content cost, we\u2019re around that 2% to 4% growth rate in content.", "So from a competitive standpoint that\u2019s an advantage for us to drop more margins to the bottom on our consumer piece and if you look at FiOS, FiOS continues to contribute more and more net income quarter-over-quarter, so that\u2019s a positive. On the Enterprise side, look I think that I feel like I record this every quarter and it does not change. I really don\u2019t see much change in the Enterprise spectrum. If you look at the European market and it\u2019s softening for us and also with the FX impact to some of that softness of where the dollar is. So I think where we have a lot of headwinds right now in Enterprise and I will honestly tell you I don\u2019t see that changing for at least the next couple of quarters at this point in time.", "Michael Stefanski ", "David next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Fran you referenced that the MORE Everything plans were generating 50% greater usage year-over-year. Is there a way to think about how much revenue that usage is contributing? And how you feel about the ability to monetize the growth in consumption in some of the rate plans have promoted higher usage buckets? Thanks. ", "Fran Shammo", "", "Yeah, thanks Michael. So look, I am not going to give you specific how the revenue increases. I mean you can see that in our ARPA which is growing nicely if you see the sequential improvement in ARPA this quarter. From last quarter it grew to a 161 from 159. So if you look at year-over-year we are up 3.5%. So I think that metrics speaks for itself as how we are monetizing the increased usage. But if you think about this the 4G LTE network is three to four times more efficient than prior network. So I guess I look at it this way, if you back in time and you go back to the voice world. And you go from the beginning of time to where that voice world matured. What happened was the price per minute decreased and usage increased, and the overall industry increased its revenue because of that increase in usage. And I, kind of, look at the data world in the same perspective. You are going to see the price per megabit decreased but the usage is going to outpace that. And at least our Tier pricing structure and the MORE Everything planned. Each time you upgrade you are going to incrementally pay a little bit more for what you use. And that\u2019s really what\u2019s favoring in on the revenue growth. But it\u2019s also coming over very efficient network that does not cost incrementally to produce that increased usage. ", "So it\u2019s a good combination to have in efficient network with an ever increasing consumption rate. So I do anticipate that the structure works. I think it\u2019s going to grow, as long as we increase the data bundle usage on a competitive standard basis. I still think though with the increasing usage as we said 50% year-over-year you are still going to see a healthy growth in the revenue on an ARPA basis. So think the combination works. But you will see that megabit or price per megabit decrease with the continued increase in consumption. ", "Michael Rollins - Citi Investment Research", "", "Thanks. ", "Michael Stefanski", "", "Next question please David?", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your questions. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "", "Thank you. Fran maybe a quick follow-up to Mike\u2019s question on the service revenue. I mean similar margins there is a lot of moving parts as we look into fourth quarter. But you saw a 100 basis points of service revenue growth deceleration. You are going to be having more Edge come through. Is that the kind of deceleration we should see again in the fourth quarter or does it do all the upgrades sort of offset that. That\u2019s number one. And then number two. Apple obviously recently announced they move to soft SIM card at least for the iPads, the new iPad that they are introducing. Verizon was conspicuously absent from the companies in the U.S. supporting that. Can you give a little color in terms of your position in terms of that new product? Thanks. ", "Fran Shammo", "", "Sure, thanks. So on the service revenue side, look there is a lot of puts and pushes here from a service revenue perspective. So if you go back I mean obviously we had a price change in the first quarter which is working its way through the system as we said before we were not going to reprice our base in one lump sum. We would work on that and address those customers that were a high churn profile, and treat them accordingly which we have done for many many years and we continue to do that. And that puts a pressure on service revenue as we get them into the price plan that\u2019s going to keep them on our network. ", "In addition, Edge has an impact here because you are moving service revenue into equipment revenue when we gave you those numbers in the upfront comments of how you should think about that. But that improves the -- if you take those recurring monthly billings on equipment revenue and put them back into the revenue stream that increases the rate of percentage increase that we have and also increases the service revenue growth year-over-year. But look there is some deceleration here as Michael brought up on the last one. As we continue to increase the bundles, this is going to take a little bit of time before people have to take the next step up. But I will tell you this quarter with our NFL agreement and the amount of video consumption we are having. We had one of the best quarters ever of customers stepping up for the next bucket. ", "So, again I think all these things factor into it, but Edge will definitely have a deceleration factor on the service revenue. As far as the soft card SIM card with Apple. We have our own SIM card that we are putting in the devices both in our indirect channels and our store channel. So that\u2019s really all that is to be said on that issue. ", "John Hodulik - UBS", "", "Okay, thanks Fran. ", "Michal Stefanski", "", "David next question please?", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "", "Hey guys, thanks. Fran could you just hit briefly on the small medium enterprise marketplace. It seems like you have continued weakness what you pointed out. How much of that is technology migration versus the cable competitors starting to move up market a little bit. And then secondly thinking about over the top there is been a lot of stuff in the past couple of weeks and it seems like sort of a building discussion between HBO, CBS. How do you guys think about that? I know bought the Intel OnCue business. When do you get more aggressive there?", "Fran Shammo", "", "Okay, thanks Mike. So look on the enterprise space, I think there is a couple of things here. I mean you do have the Tech Refresh and obviously as they come off legacy and going into IP. I mean the IP has a lower price point. And then also as I said in my opening remarks this IP market is becoming more and more competitive from a pricing perspective. So as what we\u2019re faced with as we have major customers who are renewing coming off 3 and 5 year contracts. Obviously, they\u2019re being reprised back into where the IP market is today which is pretty significantly lower than it was 3 to 5 years ago.", "So, you\u2019re having that pricing pressure happen there we\u2019re gaining new business but again it\u2019s coming in at a lower rate and we still have that decline of voice and LB that\u2019s going away and it just can\u2019t offset it. From a strategic services perspective, we\u2019re seeing some good things here we\u2019re also seeing some improvement in the federal space but as you know in this business when you start to improve it could take 6 to 8 months before that revenue comes to be as you implement this new technology. ", "So there is some glimmer of hope here as the federal government starts to purchase more but we\u2019re probably not going to see any of that until \u201815 but then again that we\u2019re working against the bunch of headwinds as far as repricing on the IP in the tech refresh. As far as cable and what\u2019s happening in the small business, look I mean, as I said in the previous quarters where we have FiOS and compete in the small business market we\u2019re gaining share. We\u2019re losing share outside of that FiOS footprint in the old copper and I\u2019m not going to be able to compete there with the speed. So that is something that we\u2019re just going to continue to see here into the future around that copper plant. But within FiOS we continue to gain share, we expand where we can to capture more small businesses in that footprint and we capitalize on that but we\u2019ve to remember it\u2019s only in 13 states.", "Unidentified Company Representative ", "", "As far as over the top goes I think that the way I look at this is great for the customer, this is great for the industry this shows that there are new innovative type arrangements that are happening and as we said before we\u2019re having discussions with a lot of content providers around innovative models going forward and I think this sets a lot of space so I think it opens up a lot of doors and it\u2019s something optimistic for the future of the video business.", "Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "", "Okay, and just like a quick follow up on the small medium piece of it, do you see cable gaining more capabilities there, or there is still really relegated to the very small customer base?", "Fran Shammo ", "", "Well, when they say that they are moving up my perception of this as we\u2019ve look at small medium business and then even in the medium business we capture medium business as anyone that has a 1,000 or less employees so it\u2019s a pretty different definition of where they\u2019re seeing they\u2019re moving up from versus where we are playing. And again within our enterprise business we\u2019re really focused on the major large enterprise customers and we really deal with that small business which is what we classify as 20 and below employees within our FiOS arena. ", "So it is a different spectrum of definition but look they are increasing their capability, they\u2019re having success in that what I would consider small business arena maybe the lower and mid business level but they\u2019ll continue to do what they do and we\u2019ll continue to do what we do.", "Mike McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "", "Great, thanks guys.", "Michael Stefanski ", "", "Next question please.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie; please go ahead with your question.", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "", "Thanks Fran, can we talk a little bit about your net debt targets?

So, it is what I\u2019ll say because I\u2019m not going to give any guidance of where I think our debt will be in \u201915 at this point but today where we stand is as you see where we\u2019re at net debt of $102 billion with our gross debt at $109.2 billion, we have a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.3 and the gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.5. I\u2019ll reference you back to S&P report that came out like maybe a month ago on some projections around what they thought, we would spend in the future for auctions and also how much debt that they think that we would pay down and report was extremely optimistic and said that they could see us being upgraded within the 12 to 24 month period of time as things continue. So, I think we are right on track with where we said we would be when we close on the Vodafone deal I said that, we wanted to get back to A minus rating within 4 to 5 years, the S&P report shows that, that could be accelerated based on our performance here. We are generating strong cash flow and what I would tell you is we\u2019re in a great position to execute on the strategic initiative that we need to execute on but we\u2019ll have more to say on this as we close out this year and come to our call in January.", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "", "And just quickly on FiOS, we\u2019ve seen a last few years significant price hikes which as you indicated is more than offset programming cost increases kind of as you look at the \u201915, should we expect more of that and can you too have revenue growth outpace cost inflation on the FiOS side?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, so I will guidance next call on where we think FiOS growth rate will be but here is what I\u2019ll say is, last year we did our price increases in the fourth quarter we\u2019re doing that again this year to be ready to absorb the content cost that always happen on January 01, so that\u2019s something that you should anticipate and you will see.", "Kevin Smithen - Macquarie", "Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "", "Next question please.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays", "Fran, just building on Mike\u2019s prior question on the recent developments around over-the-top and unbundling, it seems as though you feel pretty comfortable around the opportunity particularly giving you investment in fiber and delivering from these high bandwidth capabilities to you customer. I was wondering if you think about the competitive landscape and developments like this, does it strengthen your view on the diminishing ability for competitive direct video services like satellite technology to compete, and what seems to be an increasing on-demand and OTT world? ", "And then I guess secondly, if we think about the opportunity on the Wireless side, you folks have made a number of tuck-in acquisitions around content distribution and I was wondering how we should think about and obviously there is the relationship with the NFL, how we should think about the opportunities on that front? And when we could start to see some either material adoption from customers or sort of some of these new revenue streams come to fruition? Thanks a lot.", "Fran Shammo", "So a couple of thoughts here Amir, so number one is when I look at the, quote, over-the-top type of video area, I mean there is two avenues there is the over-the-top into the home and there is the over-the-top via Wireless. And I think over-the-top via Wireless you\u2019re already starting to see that with agreements like the NFL and some other things. I also think that with the technology of multicast coming, this will certainly open up doors for more of that content to be delivered over-the-top via the Wireless network because multicast is so efficient in delivering a programming type service over the LTE network. But of course that will be major around more live events concerts, sports those types of things.", "As far as over-the-top into the broadband home, I think that what this says is that the content providers there have realized that there is a whole population out there that do not subscribe the satellite TV or linear TV and they\u2019re trying to penetrate that millennial base that does not have these types of offers and wants something smaller, more convenient for them. And as I said, I think this brings in a lot of innovative type models of how to really attack some of these other segments of the marketplace that don\u2019t have that type of service. Do I think in the near-term, this is going to decrease linear TV or satellite TV? No, I don\u2019t. But I think it\u2019s another avenue of how we open up the ecosystem with innovative models and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re very-very interested in especially around Wireless and even as we go out into more of the broadband type market.", "Michael Stefanski", "David next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with question.", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Fran, I realized you can\u2019t talk about the AWS-3 Auction, but I wanted to explore the broadcast auction, last time we\u2019ve heard from you, you said there you needed to know more about the rules to kind of express your enthusiasm. We know little bit more today, I just wanted kind of take your pulse on what your thoughts are as we look at it today?", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, so Jennifer unfortunately, I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not actually allowed to -- my lawyers have told me I am not allowed to answer any type of spectrum questions, and at this point, it\u2019s still far in the future and we\u2019re focused on the current one. So I think at this point, I\u2019ll leave it at that.", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Got it, if I could just explore just an M2M question then.", "Fran Shammo", "Sure.", "Jennifer Fritzsche - Wells Fargo", "Obviously, great growth there, you\u2019ve guided or talked about 40% growth year-over-year. Do you think we\u2019re the point we\u2019re kind of seeing this near move or we\u2019ve often then dream for or is this the year really accelerating \u201814, \u201915 rather?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I think that as we try to allude over the last couple of quarters, we gave you growth rate this quarter. We\u2019re giving you revenue numbers and we\u2019ll continue to do that going forward. As I said before, this is not necessarily about how many connections I put on the network. This is about how many of those connections actually pay revenue when we earn money. And so as you know we stopped this closing connection a while ago. But I will tell you that the connection growth is ever increasing here. There is a lot of avenues that are being open up around Internet of Things, around healthcare, around energy management fleet. So you can go through all the verticals and there is some many solutions that are coming to forbear, which is why over -- I guess now a year and half ago, we opened up our second innovation center out in Palo Alto.", "So this is something that we\u2019re very-very focused on, I think there is a lot of good opportunity here and this will certainly be a driver of growth for the entire industry. The other thing I think that separates us apart from our competition is obviously with our Hughes acquisition. We play an another tower that no one else plays, I mean everybody is playing today in the connectivity tower, but with our Hughes acquisition, we\u2019re actually playing in the customer service and concierge tower as well and being able to deliver some of that big data and looking at ways to monetize some of that data to our end customers who are really business customers, who are looking at business-to-business versus business-to-consumers. So this is just another area, I think of growth for the industry and obviously we\u2019re capable to capitalize on that.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, we have time for one more question please.", "Operator", "And you last question today comes from Jonathan Schildkraut of Evercore Partners. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jonathan Schildkraut - Evercore Partners", "I got a question on LTE broadcast, I just wanted to get an update on where we were and understand whether sort of implementation go forward as about technology or is it about content? And then Fran, you\u2019ve made some interesting comments about sort of the growth of video within the date consumption packages that you currently have. And I\u2019m wondering if you looked at what amount of that video could ultimately be sent out over LTE broadcast and potential implications to margins? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo ", "", "Sure, thanks Jonathan. So look, LTE multicast, the network was ready in August of this past year so we have to build out the network to be able to handle multicast as you know we demonstrated it back in January with the Super Bowl where the network is capable, the chipsets are now being implemented into most of the devices that are coming out in the fourth quarter, some phones in the third quarter have those chipsets but most will have it in the fourth quarter not all.", "So look, the way I look at this ecosystem is that\u2019s going to us about a year before those chipsets ramp and there we have some volume there which gets the attention of the content provider. But as I said before having a lot of great conversations with content providers they\u2019re excited about it but again they want to see how many customers actually have the capability to use that technology and I think that will be a year away but I think that opens up a lot of new avenues for us. I don\u2019t know yet what the -- how the ecosystem will generate revenue on this, is it a revenue share model, is it an advertising model, this is a consumer pay model, we\u2019re not sure yet of how the ecosystem will play itself out and I think that will come within the next year. The other critical piece here is that for the first time coming in the fourth quarter we\u2019ll have an independent third party to be tell the content providers who actually watches their shows on a mobile handset which has never been able to be done before other than from the carriers. So I think this does again open up some of that ecosystem.", "So, from that perspective I think we\u2019re really in good shape from an ecosystem perspective and as far as the bundling goes and the usage goes again what the way to see how this multicast technology comes to market and how it\u2019s capitalized on it.", "Michael Stefanski", "", "Alright, thank you but before we end the call I\u2019d like to turn the call back to Fran for few closing remarks.", "Fran Shammo", "", "Thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining us today. Here is my closing comments I guess I\u2019d say look, we had another strong quarter of operating and financial results, we count ourselves on a quality base and a quality addition. We count on the quality of our network and driving top line growth and profitability. By focusing on execution around the assets we already have in place we\u2019re delivering consistent high quality earnings and returning value to our shareholders. At the same time we\u2019re developing new products and services in the areas of video delivery, over the top, machine-to-machine for future growth and profitability. We have great confidence in our ability to execute on our strategy and grow the business profitably while making the necessary capital investments to position us for the future. Thank you everyone for joining us today and have a great day.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

And welcome to the Verizon Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]", "Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, David. Good morning. And welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with Fran Shammo, our Chief Financial Officer.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. Replays and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website.", "Before Fran goes through our performance results, I like to cover our earnings reconciliation for the fourth quarter and highlight a few special items. These are displayed on slide three.", "For the fourth quarter we reported a loss of $0.54 per share on a GAAP basis. This reported result includes several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight.", "The largest item is our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities. This year we recorded a pretax expense of $7 billion to increase our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment which was primarily non-cash was caused by changes in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions.", "We also incurred pretax expenses of $502 million related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these two charges amounted to $4.7 billion or $1.12 per share.", "We also incurred non-operational expenses of $872 million in connection with early debt redemption and other costs. On an after-tax basis, these charges amounted to $528 million or $0.13 per share. Details regarding the income statement line item effects for these items are available on our website in the Financial and Operating Information and Non-GAAP Reconciliation schedules.", "Excluding the non-operational charges of $1.25 per share, adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the fourth quarter. This compares with adjusted EPS of $0.66 a year ago, an increase of 7.6%.", "For the full year adjusted earnings per share was $3.35, compared with $2.84 in 2013, an increase of 18%. Keep in mind that the $3.35 adjusted EPS does not reflect full ownership of Verizon Wireless from the beginning of 2014 since the transaction closed on February 21st.", "The results and growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and remarks exclude the effects of the non-operational items and are therefore on an adjusted basis. Also the growth rates we provide on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "I would like to remind everyone that due to the FCC's rules, we cannot discuss or answer any questions related to the auction or AWS-3 spectrum. When the rules permit, we do plan to provide you with an update on our participation.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and happy New Year. 2014 was a great year of execution and achievement for Verizon from both a strategic and financial perspective. We delivered strong operating and financial performance and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in any environment.", "Strategically, our most notable accomplishment was completing the transaction for full ownership of Verizon Wireless. We closed the deal in late February, providing immediate earnings accretion and full access to the cash flows of what we believe is the best Wireless asset in the world.", "Throughout the year, we continued our steady and consistent investment in our networks and platforms, which are critical to driving profitable growth in the future. Our strong cash generation enabled us to invest $17.2 billion of capital and returned value to shareholders through dividend payments, which totaled $7.8 billion for the year.", "Last September, our Board of Directors approved 3.8% dividend increase, raising the annual amount to $2.20 per share. At the same time, we are investing and innovating for the future through new growth businesses and integrated product development efforts in rapidly evolving markets like mobile video and the Internet of Things.", "The foundation of our continued success is network excellence, which is the hallmark of the Verizon brand. We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investments provide the foundation for innovative products and services, which will fuel profitable growth.", "The depth and breadth of our networks provide the fundamental strength and basis for our competitive advantage. Our industry is strong and demand is growing with customers using Wireless and Broadband even more and in different ways than ever before.", "Our competitive position is very strong and we are well-positioned from a strategic standpoint to capitalize on these market trends. In Wireless, we had another exceptional year of quality connections, growth and profitability.", "Retail postpaid net adds totaled 5.5 million for the year, with 2 million coming in a highly competitive fourth quarter that featured heavy promotional activity. Postpaid activations, gross additions, upgrades and net adds all grew by double-digit percentages in 2014.", "Total operating revenues grew 8.2% for the year and our EBITDA service margin was 48.5%, even with the short-term pressure of significant device volumes in the fourth quarter. In Wireline, consumer revenues grew 5% for the year driven by our FiOS platform.", "In 2014, we continue to increase penetration in existing markets and ended the year at 41% for Internet and just under 36% for video. Our sharp focus on productivity improvements and operating efficiency resulted in an 80-basis point expansion of our EBITDA margin to 23.2% for the full year.", "Now let's get into the fourth quarter and full-year performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on slide five. On a reported basis, total operating revenue grew 6.8% in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we added $6.5 billion to our topline, representing 5.4% growth, which exceeded our guidance of 4% consolidated revenue growth for 2014.", "If we exclude the prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold, the comparable growth rates would have been 7.3% for the fourth quarter and 5.7% for the full year. Our data revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS. In the fourth quarter, growth was favorably impacted by increased Wireless equipment revenue due to the significant 4G device activations.", "New revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics are beginning to emerge. In 2014, these revenues totaled about $585 million, with growth of more than 45%. There are countless innovative technology solutions being developed in the Internet of Things ecosystem across multiple industries.", "A great example of this was unveiled last week at the North American International Auto Show, where we announced Verizon Vehicle, a powerful new connected-vehicle service. This unique aftermarket solution modernizes traditional roadside assistance while enhancing driver safety and convenience.", "We expect this service to launch commercially in the second quarter. The addressable market is more than 200 million vehicles on the road today that are not connected to the Internet, or have a GPS unit. We believe that this large unserved market stands to greatly benefit from this new car Wireless connectivity solution.", "In addition to topline growth, we continue to focus on driving process improvements and cost efficiencies through our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $43.3 billion in 2014, an increase of 2.9%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 34.1%.", "Let's take a look at our cash flow results on slide 6. As I previously noted, the transaction to acquire full ownership of Verizon Wireless created a lack of comparability between the current and prior periods in our statement of cash flows. In 2014, cash flows from operations totaled $30.6 billion. In addition to incremental cash interest and tax payments, we made $1.5 billion in pension contributions that we did not have to fund in 2013.", "In spite of these additional cash outlays and higher capital spending, free cash flow totaled $13.4 billion for the year. Our capital program was consistent with our guidance of around $17 billion for the year with improving capital efficiency. In total, capital expenditures were $4.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.2 billion for the full year, up 3.5% from 2013.", "Our annual CapEx to revenue ratio was 13.5%, an improvement from 13.8% in 2013. The pace of capital spending in Wireless was very consistent throughout all four quarters of the year. Wireless CapEx was $2.7 billion in the quarter and $10.5 billion for the full year. We continue to invest the necessary capital to proactively stay ahead of demand.", "Our investments are focused on adding capacity to optimize our 4G LTE network, primarily by increasing network density. We are deploying existing AWS spectrum in addition to utilizing small cell technology in building solutions and distributed antenna systems.", "As I am sure you\u2019ve seen from our advertising, we now have deployed AWS or XLTE, as we have branded it in more than 400 markets, effectively doubling our existing capacity. And despite what others claim about certain aspects of their networks, when you look across the entire nation and consider all the relevant performance metrics, Verizon has the nation's largest and most reliable 4G LTE network.", "We are consistently acknowledged as the performance leader in national studies conducted by widely recognized third-party organizations. In Wireline, capital spending totaled $1.6 billion in the quarter and $5.8 billion for the year, down 7.7% from 2013. Our balance sheet remained strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals.", "We ended the year with $113.3 billion of gross debt and $102.7 billion of net debt. We significantly improved the maturity profile of our debt portfolio during 2014 through various debt market transactions. The ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA was 2.4 times. We remain committed to getting back to our pre-transaction credit rating profile into 2018 to 2019 timeframe.", "Now let's move into review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide 7. Our Wireless strategy is built on making consistent network investments and providing a compelling value proposition to our customers. Our investment strategy is focused on adding network capacity ahead of accelerating demand, which is driven by increasing 4G device adoption and higher customer usage.", "Wireless revenue growth, profitability and cash flows continue to be driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. In 2014, we strengthened the overall quality of our customer accounts. We added 24.7 million 4G devices into our postpaid connection space, representing annual growth of about 58%.", "In addition, we increased the number of More Everything shared data plans to 61% of total accounts. The average connections per account grew 4% in ARPA plus Edge installment billings increased by more than 5% in 2014.", "As I stated coming out of the third quarter, we expected and closed the year with the very high volume quarter. Total postpaid device activations in the fourth quarter were unprecedented, totaling 15.3 million, up nearly 34% over last year. More than 13 million were phones, driven by iconic smartphone launches from both Apple and Samsung.", "To give some historical perspective, these phone activations were 1.5 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2012, which at that time was a record high because it was the first time of 4G iPhone or our free 3G iPhone was available on our network. The usage characteristics of these iconic 4G smartphones also generate strong returns and higher NPV.", "Our fourth quarter promotions were successful, driving a sequential and year-over-year increase in gross adds, net adds, and upgrades. This customer growth sets us up very well for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond, as we drive usage and leverage the efficiencies of our LTE network.", "Total Wireless operating revenues were $23.4 billion in the fourth quarter, up 11%. For the full year operating revenues totaled $87.6 billion, representing growth of $6.6 billion or 8.2%. Total service revenues grew 2.8% in the fourth quarter and 5.2% for the full year. Verizon Edge installment billings totaled $443 million in the quarter and $976 million for the full year. Service revenues plus Edge installment billings grew 5.2% in the fourth quarter and 6.6% for the full year.", "As we expected, the percentage of phone activations on the Edge program increased to about 25% in the fourth quarter. We ended the year with slightly more than 7 million phones on Edge, which is just over 8% of our postpaid phone base.", "In terms of profitability, we generated $7.7 billion of EBITDA in the quarter and $35.2 billion for the full year, an increase of more than $1 billion or 3%. Our EBITDA service margin for the fourth quarter was 42%, due to the significant device volumes. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin was 48.5% compared with 49.5% in 2013. The full year EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue was 40.2%, compared with 42.2% for 2013.", "Now let's turn to a more detailed look at Wireless revenue per account, beginning on slide eight. Retail postpaid service revenue per account, or ARPA, grew 1% in the fourth quarter and 3.9% for the full year. If you add the Edge installment billings to ARPA, the growth rates increased to 3.5% for the quarter and 5.3% for the full year. We ended the year with 35.6 million postpaid accounts, an increase of 1.5%. The number of postpaid connections per account grew to 2.87, up 4% from a year ago.", "As I said, the number of customers\u2019 accounts on More Everything shared data plans increased from 46% to 61% of total. As you would expect, the average number of connections in More Everything plans are higher at 3.06 per account and grew faster, up more than 7%. And the average data usage in these accounts has increased by about 50% in the past year.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at connections growth on slide nine. We ended the year with 108.2 million total retail connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections space grew 5.5% to 102.1 million and our prepaid connections totaled 6.1 million. As we said, 2014 was a year of historical connections growth. Postpaid gross additions were 5.4 million in the quarter, up 25.5%. For the year, postpaid gross adds totaled 17.8 million, up 18% from 2013 and 20% higher than 2012.", "In terms of the gross add mix in the quarter, 55% were smartphones and about 37% were Internet devices, primarily tablets, about 6% were basic phones. This percentage mix is also representative of the full year.", "As we said in our updates, we did experience an alleviative rate of retail postpaid churn in the fourth quarter at 1.14%. Throughout the year, we maintained a disciplined approach to customer acquisition and retention with the focus on attracting and retaining high quality customers.", "Within a heightened amount of phone activity in the fourth quarter, we are pleased with the overall improvement in the quality of our phone base. Our retail postpaid net additions of 2 million in the fourth quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 31% sequentially. Our 5.5 million postpaid net additions for the year compare favorably with the 4.1 million in 2013 and 5 million in 2012.", "As far as the postpaid net add mix, the fourth quarter including 1.5 million new 4G smartphones and 1.4 million 4G tablet. Postpaid phone net adds totaled 672,000, as the 1.5 million 4G smartphones were offset in part by net declines in basic and 3G smartphones.", "Full year net adds of 5.5 million included 4.6 million 4G smartphones and 4.3 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones and non-tablet internet devices.", "Let\u2019s now turn to slide 10 and take a look at device activations and our success in driving 4G adoption and usage. Total postpaid device activations totaled 15.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 34%. For the full year, postpaid activations totaled 48.1 million, up 16% from 2013, about 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablet.", "4G LTE devices now comprise 66% of our retail postpaid connection space. This strong device adoption continues to drive increased usage. We ended the year with 67.7 million smartphones in total, about 80% of which were 4G.", "Smartphone penetration increased to 79% of total phones, about 75% of our phone activations in the quarter were customer upgrades. In total about 9.8% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter. As you would expect, a vast majority of these upgrades were 4G smartphones.", "Most of our smartphone upgrades represent an incremental revenue opportunity for us. 1.2 million were upgrades from basic phones, about 46% of the remaining smartphone upgrades were 3G to 4G, which we monetized through higher data usage and a lower cost to serve. We also continue to successfully identify and retain a high percentage of what we call high-risk high-value accounts.", "Looking ahead, we still have a sizable quality upgrade opportunity, with about 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones remaining in our postpaid connections base. We are very focused on this opportunity to upgrade customers and protect our high-quality postpaid base.", "In addition, we also have a profitable growth opportunity with further penetration of tablets. We ended the year with about 8 million postpaid tablets in our connections base. Tablets have expanded the market for postpaid devices and provide us a good value through increase data consumption and lower churn at the account level.", "Data and video usage on our network continues to rise, about 84% of our total data traffic was on the 4G LTE network. We are handling this demand and by our own measures the network performance continues to improve.", "Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide 11. In the Consumer business, we continue to see positive revenue trends driven by FiOS. In fact, we have posted 10 consecutive quarters of revenue growth in excess of 4%/.", "In the fourth quarter, Consumer revenues grew 4.1% and for the full year were up 5%, exceeding our guidance of at least 4% growth. Mass markets which includes small business, grew 3% in the quarter and 3.8% for the full year. FiOS now represents 77% of Consumer revenue.", "In the fourth quarter, FiOS Consumer revenue grew 11.1%, driven by a combination of customer growth, pricing actions and increase FiOS quantum penetration. At the end of the year, 59% of our FiOS internet customers subscribe to data speed higher than 50 megabits per second. This is up from 46% at the end of 2013.", "Throughout the year, we continue to improve the customer value proposition, driving better investment returns by creating new and innovative services on our FiOS platform. During 2014, we introduced FiOS Quantum TV. Another differentiated offer was our Speed Match service, which increases customer upload speeds to match their download speeds.", "In December, we introduced the FiOS Quantum Gateway, our new router that delivers America's fastest Wi-Fi. You will begin to see more marketing of this router and its capability shortly. Looking ahead, our focus will remain on driving higher penetration in the existing markets, which in turn will generate profitable growth and further improve our investment returns.", "In Broadband, we added 145,000 net FiOS customers in the quarter and 544,000 for the year. We have a total of 6.6 million FiOS Internet subscribers representing 41.1% penetration, which is up 160 basis points for the year. Overall, net Broadband subscribers increased 59,000 in the quarter and 190,000 for the full year. In FiOS video, we added 116,000 net customers in the quarter and 387,000 for the year.", "We have a total of 5.6 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.8% penetration, an increase of 80 basis points in 2014. In terms of our network evolution initiative, we converted an additional 52,000 Copper customers in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to around 255,000. In total, we have converted more than 800,000 customers to fiber since we started this initiative in 2011.", "Aside from the maintenance savings and improvements in customer satisfaction, conversions to fiber also provide a long-term opportunity for customers to purchase FiOS services, which result in additional recurring revenue. In 2015, we plan to convert another 200,000 Copper customers to fiber. During 2014, we also continued our consolidation efforts around central offices, which will recreate additional efficiencies.", "We have a strong commitment to customer service, and have implemented several new frontline tools that are improving efficiency and increasing customer satisfaction. While we benchmark well against the competition, we have more work to do in 2015 to take our performance to the next level.", "Let's turn to slide 12 and cover enterprise and the wholesale business. In the enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 4.6%, which included about $30 million of pressure from FX.", "For the full year, revenue of $13.7 billion was down 3.5%. The overall story is unchanged as declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continue to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale.", "Strategic services grew 1.5% in the quarter and 2.3% for the year. This category includes both of IP layer and application such as data center, cloud, security and managed and professional services. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in application services.", "In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.8% in the quarter and 5.6% for the full year. On the positive side, healthy demand for Ethernet services continues but revenue declines from price compression, technology migration and other secular challenges more than offset this growth.", "Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment were down 1.6% in the quarter and 0.5% for the full year. In terms of profitability, EBITDA increased 4.3% in the quarter and 3% for the full year.", "The EBITDA margin was 23.9% in the quarter and 23.2% for the year, up 80 basis points from 2013. While we are making steady progress in the Wireline business and achieved our goal of expanding margins, we are far from satisfied. There is more work to do to drive sustainable improvements in both revenue growth and profitability.", "Our path to improve profitable growth includes driving further FiOS penetration and improving operating and capital efficiency. In the enterprise and the wholesale business, we are changing our revenue mix toward newer growth services like cloud, security and professional services.", "On the cost side of the equation, we have realized many noteworthy process improvements and efficiency gains utilizing our Verizon Lean Six Sigma principles. We are confident that this continued focus will improve our overall cost structure, ultimately resulting in a much stronger Wireline business.", "Let's move next to our summary slide. Our operating and financial performance in 2014 demonstrated once again that we are in a strong market position with a proven ability to compete effectively and execute our strategy. Our high quality customer base and superior networks are the hallmark of our brand and provide the fundamental strength upon which we will build our competitive advantage.", "2014 was a remarkable year from a financial viewpoint. We delivered 18% growth in adjusted earnings per share with very strong cash flows. We executed a strategically important $130 billion transaction through a combination of debt and equity.", "Our strong cash generation allowed us to invest $17.2 billion in capital, pay $7.8 billion in dividends, make incremental cash interest in tax payments and redeem higher coupon notes in the course of restructuring our debt maturity schedule. In addition, we declared a 3.8% dividend increase and improved our cash position since the closing of the Vodafone transaction.", "Our customer growth in the fourth quarter, particularly in Wireless gives us a great confidence heading into 2015.", "In terms of our 2015 outlook, it is difficult to predict the competitive intensity with others, particularly in Wireless. However, we have faced highly competitive Wireless environments before and I have always been able to successfully and profitably grow the business, because our customers understand the value of our services. In this environment, we will continue to protect our base by focusing on net adds and upgrades that make financial sense for our business.", "We will also continue to focus on growing in the right customer segments, while at the same time creating new revenue streams for the future. Over a sustained period of time, our industry is governed by free cash flow dynamic. To be successful, companies need to generate free cash flow, which can be invested in their networks to attract and retain customers by providing a quality experience.", "In that context, we are targeting the following for 2015, consolidated revenue growth of at least 4%, sustain profitability with a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin at a level consistent with our full year 2014 performance, strong free cash flow generation with consolidated capital spending of between $17.5 billion and $18 billion, and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $700 million.", "In terms of income taxes, we realized the cash benefit in 2014 due to the extension of bonus depreciation, which will also have a carryover benefit in 2015. However, with the full year of 100% Wireless net income, we expect total cash income taxes to increase in 2015. We also expect our effective tax rate for book purposes to be in the area of 34% to 36%.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you, Fran. David, we are now ready to take the first question.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick", "Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, I guess to start speaking of free cash flow needs in the Wireless industry, can you help us range your 2015 free cash flow given the commentary on higher cash pension expense, EIP and CapEx?", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Phil. I\u2019m not going to get into the specific guidance on free cash flow, but you can see what we generated this year. I\u2019ve guided you to a consistent EBITDA margin on a growth rate of revenue of at least 4%, and I want to stress that at least 4%.", "The other thing is, I think that cash taxes at this point given where we are, if we don't give bonus extension from '15 into '16 that obviously that puts more pressure in '16 on cash taxes as well. So I'm not going to get into specific guidance on that metric, but I think I've given enough to put us in the ballpark.", "Phil Cusick", "Maybe I can try again. Given the revenue growth, can you talk about your assumptions on the Edge mix in 2015, so how much of that revenue growth should we think about is coming from equipment revenue that\u2019s more recognized than cash? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Yeah. So I think on the revenue growth side of at least 4%, if you think about that metric. What we are planning for right now is that our Edge take rate probably increases to around 34%, 35% take rate, so some of that will be equipment revenue.", "But I think what you have to focus in on is if you look at the service revenue component, you look at the recurring revenue of FiOS. So if you look at the recurring revenues of this business, 4% plus is an achievable metric, but obviously equipment revenue will play a factor in that.", "But keep in mind as we start to -- start to go out into the future on the installment sales, the installment sales really neutralized themselves over two-year period of time if you think of it that way. So as we collect more on installment sales, we are putting more on, but cash flow is starting to catch up with it. So I would keep that all in mind.", "The other thing too is from a cash flow perspective, we are looking at alternatives around the receivable as this grows. So you could see us do things around securitization in the future, not that that we are announcing anything today. But that is a possibility that we\u2019re looking at as we continue to grow that mix on the Edge program.", "Phil Cusick", "That helps. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, we can take the next question now?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery", "Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, you talked in your summary comments about your focus on non-strategic assets sales. There has been a lot of talk for about towers for a while, we haven\u2019t seen anything yet. Can you just talk about towers and then access lines, datacenters, enterprise, how you are thinking about some other -- some of these assets and what we should expect going forward? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Look, I think, we\u2019ve talked about a lot of this in the past. But at this point, we are aware of all the rumors in the marketplace. Naturally we don't have any comment on any specific rumors, but we have consistently said that we are always looking at all kinds of strategic transactions and if they are the right transactions and provide value to our shareholders, we will execute on those transactions and at that time, we will come back to you and announce our strategy around that. But beyond that there's really nothing else to say on this subject.", "Simon Flannery", "So, just to say, are you -- you expect to make some transactions this year or is it just dependent on the terms?", "Fran Shammo", "I think, what I would say is, we continue to look at all strategic availability and if something makes sense then we will execute on that strategic initiative.", "Simon Flannery", "Great. Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, we can take the next question now?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Fran, just on your comments about free cash flow kind of governing the competitive intensity in the space, could you talk about the assumptions that you're making for your 2015 expectations? Are you assuming that competition kind of continues at its current course and speed? Does it level out at kind of current levels or are you assuming that maybe it even reverses course, it would be kind of helpful to get a sense of the backdrop you're making assumptions on?", "And then second, just kind of whilst in the headlines, could you opine a little bit on what you think the import of Google kind of doing an MVNO in this space, is did you have a chance to talk to them about what their plans are, as they kind of where going in the market looking to try to execute on something? It would be helpful to get some color on that? Great. Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "All right. So look, I think, it\u2019s important just to set the stage here. All the hype around 2014 around price competition and the intensity of the competition, and just look at what Verizon delivered during all that period of time.", "So we had topline growth of 5.7%, we expanded the EBITDA by $1 billion in Wireless, we expanded the EBITDA in Wireline of $200 million, we had net [phone] [ph] adds which seemed to be the big issue of 1.3 million in this competitive environment and we grow our overall net adds year-over-year by 24%. So I think the basic point here is, is that we will continue to compete and we will continue to compete at a positive profitable value.", "I talk -- also it's important as we enter into 2015, with the competition we are also doing a lot of different things. So number one, based on our base, as I said in my comments, we saw 13 million 3G smartphones and 18.5 million basic phones that we will pursue to upgrade into our 4G LTE network that is more efficient, generates more revenue. Tablets are only 8% of our base and as I said in the past, tablets will continue to be a very large piece of our growth into the future.", "Tablets are very, very good because, one, they make it more sticky at the account level; two, we get a recurring revenue stream albeit lower than a smartphone but the subsidy on that is much reduced. And then also, it also increases the amount of usage and video uptake on the network, which is what we\u2019re driving to is the more usage to benefit on the bundles.", "The other thing is, as you look out to us and directions we\u2019re taking, obviously as we stated Internet of Things is going to be a very important category, 585 million up 45% year-over-year. And we don't really disclose it but we have over 15 million connections now of Internet of Things. We announced the Verizon vehicle as I said, you should look at us as launching over-the-top MobileFirst sometime this as Lowell has talked about in the past.", "And on the Wireline side, we just launched a new router which we think is going to improve both the intake of video into the home. But it's also very important because it has to sustain the ability of Wireless products within that home. And as you know, when you get four to five devices running on that router today that, that can only deliver up to 75 megabits, you're really not getting 75 megabits.", "So this router will be able to produce significant higher throughput and we believe it\u2019s the fastest in the industry today. So putting that all in context from a competitive standpoint and what we can deliver, the guidance we're giving you is based on all the strategic action that we will be taking in the future.", "The other two things I would talk about is if you look at our prepaid base, again another positive quarter, up 7.5% on ARPU growth and then of course our own reseller base with our own strategic initiatives with that whether you call it a reseller base or MVNO is all positive and growing positively. So that leads me into the Google discussion.", "I guess what I would say right off the bat, number one, is this is not just another very prime example of the intensity in the competition around this industry. The availability of the open networks and access to the networks and this is why another reason why this industry does not need to be regulated.", "I would also say on this one is, if you look at Google, they've entered the fiber, they\u2019ve done other initiatives. Their whole purpose is to increase speeds so that people can do more search. What I would say is we\u2019ll have to wait to see how they execute on the MVNO but listen MVNOs or resellers or people leasing the network from carriers has been around for 15 years. It's a complex issue. You have to deal directly with the consumer. There is a whole infrastructure that's needed to do that.", "So I think this is another example of where Google is going to enter the market under a platform basis to do what they want to do. And it's just another competitor as we look at it. So I'll leave it at that.", "David Barden", "Thanks a lot, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, we can take the next question now please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik", "Okay. Thanks. Good morning guys. As you look at the results of the Wireless quarter churn and the upgrade rate really for standout as having spiked. And obviously, there is couple of drivers, I think the competition and the number of iPhones you guys are renewing this quarter. So is there a way, Fran, to sort of delineate the two and as you look out to 2015, are these -- do you expect these numbers to remain elevated because of competition or should we expect them to both, trend back towards a more normalized level? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Yeah, thanks John. So I think this is what we need to look at, as we said in the remarks and follow the words carefully is that we will pursue our base. We will pursue net adds and we will pursue upgrades that are financially beneficial to the company. So what that means is at a 1.14% churn rate, you should take that as we did not go to places where we do not financially want to go to save a customer.", "And there's going to be certain customers who leave us for price and we're just not going to compete with that because it doesn\u2019t make financial sense for us to do that. As far as why upgrades were so high, I think you have to go back a little bit and reflect on what we did in the past. So if you look at 2013, we made a lot of policy changes around upgrades. It pushed the upgrade view back into \u201814. So in \u201814, we took probably more upgrades than we generally would have taken because of those policy changes.", "But as we came out of the third quarter, I said that we had about 3.2 million iPhones in our base that were coming out of contract. And that was the signal that we were going to aggressively go after those 3.2 million customers and we did. We are very satisfied with the quality of the upgrades.", "So if you look at it from that perspective in the remarks I made, look at it on a percentage basis. 78% of our upgrades are what we would call strategic quality upgrades and that means a 3G to 4G, or basic to 4G, or a high value type customer who delivers a lot of value to us and we appreciate their business and we want to keep them as a customer.", "So that\u2019s how you should view this, John and I think that with the competition and some of the pricing that\u2019s out there, you should think that we are going to have a higher churn rate because some customers we are just going to financially keep.", "John Hodulik", "Sounds good. Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Rollins", "Thanks for taking the question. Just two. First, if you look at the margin guidance that you are providing on a consolidated level and the aspirations to improve the Wireline margins, does that mean that Wireless margins are facing some headwinds just as you are processing the higher volume environment coming off the fourth quarter and some of your initiatives that you are planning for 2015?", "And then secondly, Fran, if you can give us an update on your video strategy with any more details or perspectives you could share with us on what that product might look like later in the year when you talked about launching it? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Michael. So on the competitive consolidated margin, look I think it's important again that you focus on the words. We said at least topline 4% growth. We said that we would have at least a consolidated margin consistent with 2014, but I think you need to put it in perspective that we had an extremely heavy fourth quarter in 2014. So, I would not expect that to repeat in 2015, given the iconic devices that hit and given the level of competition at this point in time versus what we would expect next year.", "I think the other important thing too is, as you are focusing in on this, I think it's important to focus on 2014 earnings per share, so we grew at 18%. I know most of you will subtract out the 10% for the accretion of Vodafone. So when you look at it, the core business in this highly competitive environment grew at 8%. I would also say that don\u2019t get ahead of yourselves on the Wireline accretion of margin as Lowell and I said before, this will be a slow progression of Wireline accretion. So we grew 80 basis points this year. We will continue to focus in on topline growth and continue to take out those costs, continue our copper to fiber migration efforts and continue to become more efficient of the company. So, I wouldn't read too much into. We expect Wireline to jump off the charts and Wireless to go down.", "On the over-the-top strategy, I guess I'm not going to disclose as to too much what we are going to do. But I think if you look at the environment, there is a lot of positive things coming out of the environment. So if you look at what Dish has done around some of their recent launches, look at CBS and their own launch of over-the-top with their own programming. This just leads us to a path of content owners are willing to open up their content to different models and that's exactly what we are going to execute on it. And we are working with many content providers to join that model and we will have a lot more to say about that and Marni and I obviously, Lowell will talk more about that when we launch our first product come this summer.", "Mike Rollins", "Thanks very much.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks. And I\u2019m going to follow up a little bit on what Mike said and Fran in your response. Typically when we see telecom operators start ramping content driven models, there is a big upfront investment particularly in content costs. So just wonder if you can maybe just help us think, are we going to begin to see any of that spending flow through your P&L this year and is that a component of how you thought about your margin guidance you provided? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Well, number one, on the traditional model of FiOS, obviously in our guidance we've included an increase in content cost because every year you have a content cost and you should feature in around, consistent with where we were in 2014 around a 3% to 4% content increase cost right now is what we are projecting.", "As far as the new model, again, I'm not going to get a lot into that model. You should not think about it as a traditional linear TV model. It's going to be, I would think a different type of a model. So, we'll wait till midsummer when we can talk more about that. But within our plan, we do have those content costs.", "Brett Feldman", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike McCormack", "Hey, guys. Thanks. I guess, Fran, following on, I guess, somewhat related to the Wireless margin story in 2015. But just trying to get a sense for what your thoughts are on ARPA sort of puts and takes? Obviously, you\u2019re talking about some potential, I guess, save retention tools on your base, the competitive landscape. Do we still think you can get some modest growth on ARPA in '15?", "And then secondly, the CapEx level, I think, is a bit above what prior commentary had been, not dramatically, but trying to get a sense for what that is, whether it\u2019s Wireline, Wireless? I know you and I had spoken about densification back in December, I am assuming it\u2019s probably related to that. Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Mike. So, on the VZW margin, the follow-up question on around the ARPA, I think this becomes a more tricky question, because obviously ARPA is around service. And with the Edge program, we are kind of convoluting that now, that it\u2019s a tougher metric to get your hands around, which is why we are giving out the recurring installment billings to try to get it on an apples-to-apples comparison. But if you think about that, we grew that ARPA by 5.2%.", "So look, I think, given everything that\u2019s going on, and given that the fact that I said we would have a topline growth of 4%, obviously we believe that we can continue to accrete the ARPA of this business, given everything I said about the additional growth things that we\u2019re keen in on, just the jump off point that we came into this year.", "So the other thing too is if you go back to 2012, the fourth quarter of '12 was very much like this quarter of '14. We really placed the bet on growth and upgrades and solidifying our base. In '12, albeit we added lot more smartphone net adds back then, but it\u2019s pretty much the same quarter that gives us a great basis to jump off into 2015. So that\u2019s how I would think about the ARPA as a metric.", "On CapEx, Mike, it goes directly to what you said. I have been pretty consistent with this in the fact that we will spend more CapEx in the Wireless side and we will continue to curtail CapEx on the Wireline side. And some of that\u2019s, because we are getting to the end of our committed build around FiOS. Penetration is getting higher. We are reconnecting homes that we\u2019ve already connected.", "So it\u2019s not additional capital that we have to outlay and we are very focused on those, what we call connected homes that are not our customers to go aback after them that that is a very good return for us, because we\u2019ve already spent the capital to connect that home. So it\u2019s a lot of combination around that. But yes, this is around densification, this is around our projection of growth for the Wireless industry and staying ahead of that. So again, it\u2019s all about encompassing. So we are looking at a slight increase from where we ended 2014.", "Mike McCormack", "And Fran, just thinking about the densification, are there particular markets where you guys are spending more? Are there pressure points that you look at in '15 is being areas where you would need to sort of not rush and go out and spend, but I guess there is a focus?", "Fran Shammo", "Not really. I mean, it\u2019s pretty consistent with what we did in '14. I mean, obviously, your major cities are where you have your biggest densification happening right now. Because as we launch AWS around the U.S. and get the coverage map up, AWS is really handling most of that outside of the major cities, but it\u2019s the major cities that are being densified on a quicker basis.", "Mike McCormack", "Okay, great. Thank you, guys.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, let\u2019s take the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you very much. And good morning, folks. Fran, it does seem as one of the standouts for you folks has been the ability to reduce costs through operational efficiency. And I know you touched upon this with some of your questions in your prepared remarks. But is there any sense that you can give us sort of the scope of opportunities over a multiyear period? I guess the genesis of the question is really we find ourselves in an intensely competitive environment as you had mentioned. How much opportunity is there for you folks to continue to drive down costs in order to retain this sort of industry leading margin profile on cash generation ability that you guys have built over for the last couple of years?", "Fran Shammo", "Just a couple of thoughts around that. Number one is, obviously the more and more we convert 3G customers to 4G that affords us the ability to get on a much more efficient network, it affords us the ability to reappropriate our spectrum, and it affords us to actually start to run down if you will the higher cost network of 3G. So, all of that plays into this.", "The other thing is, as we said before, we have a very cost structure in servicing our customers and you\u2019re going to see some things different of how we approach customers and mainly around getting more around self serve, so that we can do more of the handsets. And we saw over the last two years, starting in 2013 into the 2014, that this played a big role and how we take cost out of the Wireless cost structure.", "On the Wireline side, it\u2019s just continuing to do more of the same. So we really don\u2019t play up the fact of all the copper to fiber migration. But this is really starting to pay benefits to us. And as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been doing this for the last three years. We are now in the position of starting to shutdown central offices, which free up real estate for us to monetize and get out of. It reduces the property tax around this. So there\u2019s a lot of efficiencies that come from this.", "And the other thing is that within the one-time charges, you probably picked up a severance accrual. And in December, the Wireline company already has reduced about 2,300 headcount, including about 1,300 represented workforce, who took an additional incentive for them to voluntary retire. So we are setting the company up once again to produce a very beneficial efficient cost structure going into 2015.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you very much.", "Michael Stefanski", "David, next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kevin Smithen of Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.", "Kevin Smithen", "Thank you. Wanted to follow-up in your comments about not chasing on profitable subs and upgrades. Does that change if you begin to go negative on phone net adds? Like what is your tolerance for sub losses because in the past that has sort of been a key level where you sort of responded with some retention in offensive marketing?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I mean, Kevin, we always have save programs and specific targeting to a specific customer base or a specific segment, so that's not going to change. My point is here is that there are certain customers that will go for the lowest price. And at that point, we\u2019re probably not going to compete on price with those customers and that\u2019s what you saw.", "I mean, if you look at it for the fourth quarter, we added 672,000 net phone adds. So, I think you have to keep it all in focus that what we are gaining. We are gaining 4G high-value customers and we\u2019re not necessarily losing that 4G high-value customer. So, I think you have to look at it in a holistic point of view, but that's really the strategy that we have deployed and we will continue to execute on our strategy.", "Kevin Smithen", "And just a quick follow-up. Does your guidance change at all under certain Title II outcomes and what is your current thinking on this given recent government comments?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, that\u2019s a great question because I personally have been misquoted, both in the press and in Congress on what I've said. So this is a good question for me to clear this up. So first of all, this is not of an issue about Internet rules. It\u2019s about an issue of FCC reclassifying Broadband to Title II service. And this will absolutely affect us and the industry on long-term investment in our networks.", "And that can be seen factually as to what happened in the rest of the world where you have high regulation, the networks are not invested in, there are not good quality of service networks and that's where this will put us. I guess, I would emphasize also that the approach in whole or in part on Title II is an extreme and risky path that will jeopardize our investment and the development of innovation in Broadband Internet and related services.", "It will also tie up the industry in a very uncertain time and cause all types of litigation. So when I said before, I misquoted on the fact that it would not hurt our investment, I was talking about 2015. But if this piece of Title II was to pass, I can absolutely assure you, it would certainly change the way we've been view our investment in our networks.", "The other thing too is, as I think it's important to show that this industry on a high-level basis has invested about $50 billion a year in networks and improving the quality of service and open network to everyone. And that's what the industry belief is, that this is an open internet basis.", "If we could curtail the investment of this industry, it will definitely trickle down to what we would consider middle-class jobs. And it\u2019s because most of at least, for Verizon Wireless, a lot of our build are done by thousands of contractors across the United States, that will impact those small business and impact their employees.", "So from that perspective, I guess, what we would say, Kevin, is we would encourage Congress to adopt a legislative solution, Congress has the authority to adopt clear rules of the road that will allow policy makers in the industry to move on to more important things. So, I think, that summarizes the position about Title II.", "Kevin Smithen", "Very helpful. Thank you.", "Fran Shammo", "Okay. Time for one more question, David?", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer Fritzsche", "Great. Thanks Fran. Just two quick questions if I may, just an update on thoughts around the tower sale, I assume it\u2019s still part of the plan. Secondly, I just wanted to explore the ARPU question, a lot was made of your November 1st price cut? But am I crazy to think you could look at this glass half full, because with 84% of your traffic now on LTE and I think you said 66% you are base on LTE phone? Did you see some movement upward with that price change that actually could have offset any sort of downward movement you saw? Thanks a lot.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Jennifer. Well, on the tower sales, look, I think, we\u2019ve been pretty clear on the remarks here. We are not going to talk about the rumors anymore until there is something that substantially state. So at this point, I think, we\u2019ll just leave it at that.", "As far as the price cuts, you are absolutely correct, Jennifer. When we look at the provisioning of our base, we have seen a significant increase in the amount of customers who are taking our higher data plans, if you will, that drive more revenue. And even with those higher plans, we still see a large portion of those customers breaking their bundles because of video consumption in the increase in video consumption.", "So, yes, there is an offset here. It is not all just dilution, there is an upgrade of what customers are using and obviously, we built the plans around LTE, we built the plans around, we want customers to use more, because that's what will generate incremental revenue for the business and give us a return on the continued investment in our network.", "Jennifer Fritzsche", "Great. Thank you.", "Fran Shammo", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay. That\u2019s all the time we have for question, but before we end the call, I\u2019d like to turn it back to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Mike. So at conclusion here, I just want to state that Verizon had another strong year of operating and financial results with topline revenue growth and quality earnings and cash generation. We are very focused on driving growth and profitability. To that end, our execution strategy is around the assets we have in place.", "As always, we continually look at options for monetizing certain less strategic assets and creating value for our shareholders. We continue to develop new products and services in the area of video delivery, Internet of Things that will drive growth and profitability into 2015 and beyond. We look forward to a very positive 2015 with confidence in our ability to execute our strategy, grow the business profitably and invest for our future. Thank you all for joining today and have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Marley. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted to our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. GAAP reported earnings for the quarter were $1.04 per share compared to $1.01 per share in the second quarter of last year. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter of last year included $0.10 per share from a gain on the sale of Spectrum, so on an adjusted basis EPS growth was 14.3%. Adjusted EBITDA growth for the quarter excluding this prior-year gain was 6%.", "Through the first half of the year, earnings totaled $2.06 per share compared with adjusted earnings of $1.76 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would've been about $0.07 higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate for the first half of this year was 12.6%. Beginning this quarter, we are reporting Wireless equipment revenue and Wireless cost of equipment in our consolidated statements of income.", "In our Wireless segment, we are reporting the cost of equipment and the cost of service, which were previously combined as cost of service and sales. Prior period detail at both the consolidated and Wireless segment level is included in the financial and operating information schedules on our website. I would also remind you that our Wireline results include the operations that we agreed to sell to Frontier. This will be the case until the transaction closes, which is on track for the first half of 2016. As we pointed out last quarter, the assets and liabilities associated with these operations have been classified on the balance sheet as held for sale, and as such, we are no longer recording depreciation expense.", "For the full year, we continue to estimate the earnings benefit to be about $0.12 to $0.13 per share. The acquisition of AOL, which we announced in mid-May closed on June 23. Our balance sheet at June 30 includes the AOL assets and liabilities. Our income statement for the second quarter does not reflect any results of AOL operations for the last seven days of the month due to immateriality. The AOL results of operations will be fully included in the third quarter.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate that we continue to compete effectively and execute our strategy, which is focused on providing consistent network reliability and a great customer experience. Once again we delivered strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows.", "We believe that steady and consistent network and platform investment provides the foundation for innovative products and services for future profitable growth. We are committed to building the business for the future through a disciplined capital allocation model that we outlined almost two years ago and continue to execute.", "Through the first half of this year we have invested approximately $18 billion in Spectrum licenses and capital for future network capacity. We also invested more than $4 billion to acquire new capabilities with the AOL transaction, which supports our long-term video strategy. In addition, we returned more than $9 billion to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. The $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program was completed in early June, resulting in an overall reduction of 101.6 million shares.", "We facilitated these initiatives while keeping our leverage ratio essentially unchanged and remaining on track with our deleverage plan. On the execution front, we had a strong quarter of quality connections growth and profitability in Wireless. We had more than 1.1 million retail postpaid net adds, which included 321,000 net phone additions. We also had very strong customer retention with postpaid churn of 0.90%, down four basis points year-over-year. This was our lowest churn rate in three years.", "Total Wireless revenue grew 5.3% and EBITDA increased by 9.1%. Our EBITDA margin on both service and total Wireless revenue expanded on a year-over-year basis. Our Wireline results were once again highlighted by growth in the consumer market, where revenues were up over 4%. Our segment EBITDA margin expanded modestly on a sequential and year-over-year basis.", "Now, let's get into our second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on slide four. Total operating revenue was $32.2 billion in the quarter, and if we exclude the prior-period revenues from the public sector business we sold last year, the comparable growth rate would've been 2.8%. Consolidated top line revenue growth continued to be driven by Wireless and FiOS usage.", "We believe that future revenue growth will come from video and the Internet of Things at both the network and platform layers. Over the past several years we have been investing in these platforms and positioning ourselves to capitalize on these new sources of growth.", "In terms of video, we will introduce our mobile-first OTT video product in late summer. As you know, we have already announced some initial content partners. Our acquisition of AOL further enhances our video strategy through its digital media and advertising platform capabilities, a portfolio of content brands with a domestic average of about 190 million unique visitors per month, and its loyal e-mail subscription customer base. We are excited to have the very talented people of AOL on the Verizon team and look forward to their contributions to our success.", "As far as Internet of Things, we think that the transportation, healthcare, and energy industries in particular present great opportunities for us and we are very active fostering innovation in these areas. We are very well-positioned to capitalize on these new growth opportunities and we will continue to develop business models to monetize usage on our network and at the platform level.", "Within our current results, new revenue streams from the Internet of Things and telematics continue to emerge and grow. These revenues totaled approximately $165 million in the quarter and about $320 million year-to-date. We continue to be focused on reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies while improving the overall customer experience. Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.8 billion, up 6% on an adjusted basis, and our EBITDA margin expanded by 110 basis points to 36.6%.", "Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide five. As highlighted a few minutes ago, our capital allocation model is disciplined and consistent. The priorities are to invest necessary capital in our networks to stay ahead of demand, return value to shareholders and maintain a strong balance sheet. The cash flows we generate enable us to execute on this investment strategy, pay competitive dividends and deleverage to further strengthen the balance sheet. In the second quarter, cash flows from operations were $8.7 billion. Through the first half, cash flow from operations totaled $18.9 billion but included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring.", "We also continue to securitize wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $1.2 billion in cash proceeds in the second quarter. Free cash flow for the first half of the year excluding the tower proceeds totaled $8.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.5 billion in the quarter and $8.2 billion for the first half of the year. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have the financial flexibility to grow the business and pursue our strategic goals. We ended the quarter with $113.7 billion of gross debt, net debt of $110.7 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.5 times. As I said earlier, our deleveraging plans remain on track.", "Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on slide six. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. As I said earlier, total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.3% in the quarter to $22.6 billion. Service revenue of $17.7 billion declined 2.2% while equipment revenue increased to $3.9 billion, up nearly 62%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3%.", "For customers who select device installment plans, lower service pricing is exchanged for higher device payments. Equipment revenue, which is largely recognized upfront, is much higher than in the subsidy model. Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more customers choose unsubsidized devices, and equipment revenues will continue to increase with installment plan adoption. Customer demand for device installment plans has increased. The percentage of phone activations on installments grew to 49% in the quarter compared with 39% in the first quarter and only 18% a year ago. Phone activations on device installment plans totaled $4.7 million in the quarter, and we now have more than 14 million customers on these plans, representing roughly 16% of our postpaid phone base. Looking ahead, we believe that the percentage of phone activations on installment will continue to increase and will likely be around 60% in the third quarter.", "In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.1%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.1%, up 580 basis points. The EBITDA margin on total Wireless revenue expanded to 43.9% in the quarter, up from 42.3% a year ago.", "Now, let's turn to slide seven and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 109.5 million total retail connections. This does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 5.2% to 103.7 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.8 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 3.9 million but were down year-over-year due primarily to lower tablet volumes. As I highlighted earlier, we had a very strong customer retention in the quarter with postpaid churn improving both sequentially and year-over-year to 0.90%.", "One of our priorities this year was to improve customer retention and we are doing so with a disciplined approach focusing on high value customers. Our retail postpaid net additions of more than 1.1 million were nearly twice the net additions in the first quarter. The quality of the net adds remained very strong with 842,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter. Postpaid phone additions totaled 321,000 as net phone adds of 588,000 were partially offset by a net decline of 266,000 basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 852,000 in the quarter and net prepaid devices declined by 126,000.", "Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on slide eight. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.3 million in the quarter, up nearly 2%. About 85% of these activations were phones and the rest were mainly tablets. We ended the quarter with 70.1 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to approximately 81% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise approximately 73% of our retail postpaid connections base. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage.", "Approximately 87% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has essentially doubled in the past year. About 7.2% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. The quality of our phone base continues to improve as we add new 4G customers and upgrade our basic phone and 3G smartphone customers to 4G devices as part of our retention efforts.", "In the past year, our 4G smartphone connections have increased by 17.8 million or about 40% to 61.6 million. We still have a sizable opportunity remaining with roughly 16 million basic phones and about 9 million 3G smartphones in our postpaid connections base.", "We also have a profitable growth opportunity with tablets as they provide good value through increased data consumption and lower churn rate at the account level. We ended the quarter with 9.6 million tablets in our postpaid connections base, so overall penetration is still under 10%. In terms of capital spending, we continue investing for the capacity to further optimize our 4G LTE network and position the network for the future. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.1 billion in the quarter and $5.5 billion for the first half of the year, about 4% higher on a year-to-date basis.", "National studies consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. Currently, our 700 MHz and AWS-1 spectrum bands, which represent approximately 40% of our license spectrum portfolio are utilized in our LTE network. We are just beginning to reform 1900 PCS spectrum from 3G to 4G LTE in select markets representing the next phase of spectrum to be deployed to serve our growing LTE usage.", "Our network densification plans, which includes small cells, DAS nodes and in-building solutions are on schedule. In New York City we are well into our deployment and continue to scale and develop a healthy pipeline. Downtown Chicago is another large urban market with small cell densification plans well underway consistent with what we outlined on our post-auction conference call.", "Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on slide nine. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of our positive revenue trends resulting in revenue growth of 4.5%. Mass markets which includes Small Business, grew 3.2%. FiOS now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the second quarter FiOS consumer revenue grew 9.8% driven by customer growth, increased penetration of our Quantum products and higher pay-per-view sales due to the prize fight in early May.", "Our FiOS Quantum broadband service continues to scale and with a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, 64% of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabits speed tier where 23% of our consumer FiOS customers currently subscribe.", "In broadband we added 72,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.8 million FiOS Internet subscribers, which is 41.4% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers decreased by 25,000 in the quarter. In FiOS Video, we added 26,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.7% penetration.", "We had strong customer interest in our Custom TV offering. More than one third of our FiOS video gross adds this quarter opted for a Custom TV package. And we also saw a migration demand from existing customers. We will continue to work with content providers on this new product, which so far is ahead of our expectations. While adoption of Custom TV may initially have a negative impact on revenue growth, it should improve profitability.", "In the second quarter, we experienced a slowing of FiOS customer growth, which we attribute to triple play offer changes at a time of increased competitive intensity. We have since made some promotional adjustments and our exit rate sales volumes have shown improvement. We are focused on the continued evolution of our Wireline network. In the second quarter, we converted 51,000 copper customers bringing our first half total to 98,000. As I have previously noted post-conversion, we experienced significant improvements in customer satisfaction and a lower cost to serve.", "Our agreement with Frontier for the sale of Wireline assets in the non-contiguous states of Florida, Texas, and California is also part of our network evolution as it will enable us to better focus our efforts on the highly dense markets in the Northeast. We are working closely with Frontier to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and assure a seamless transition. We are making progress and remain on track to close the transaction in the first half of 2016.", "Let's turn to slide 10 and cover Enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the second quarter lower Enterprise revenue declined 6.4%. Excluding foreign exchange pressure the revenue decline was similar to the first quarter.", "Declines in legacy transport revenue and CPE continued to outweigh growth in the newer and more strategic applications, which are smaller in scale. Revenue from services in the IP layer has been impacted by competitive price compression, which is offsetting growth in applications.", "In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 4.5% in the second quarter, which was better than expected due to some nonrecurring items. We expect continued price compression, technology migration, and other secular challenges to pressure wholesale revenues, which we expect to decline in the 5% to 6% range for the full year.", "Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.2%, which included some FX pressure. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5% in the quarter, up 10 basis points. We are very committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. The Wireline head count was down 10% year-over-year, and we continue to strive for gains in operational efficiency. As I said, we are far from satisfied and we will continue to work on our cost structure. Capital spending in the Wireline for the first half of the year totaled $2.2 billion, down 19%.", "Let's move next to our summary slide. We've had a good first half of 2015 delivering strong financial and operating results with double-digit growth in earnings and strong cash flows. As always, we continue to invest in our networks and platforms to position us for future growth. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of Things. We are excited about the potential for revenues from these new products and services to grow quickly and become more meaningful in the future. Our acquisition of AOL will be a key piece in our over-the-top mobile video strategy, accelerating our capabilities in digital media and advertising.", "We are confident in our ability to sustain profitability. Consolidated EBITDA for the first half of the year was up nearly 6% on an adjusted basis and our EBITDA margin expanded 90 basis points to 37%. In terms of consolidated revenue outlook, we expect third quarter revenue growth to be higher than this quarter. For the full year, our consolidated revenue guidance is for growth of at least 3%. These growth estimates exclude revenue from AOL, which will become part of our results in the third quarter. We continue to target overall capital spending in the range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion in 2015.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Fran. Marley, we're now ready for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess two, if I could. Fran, could you kind of give us a little bit more color on the change in the revenue guidance for the year? Obviously what's different between when you were expecting 4% versus 3%? And then obviously what the moving parts are to get accelerated revenue growth in the second half?", "And then I think the second question would be, for the markets reacting to something today, I think it's the sequential movement in the ARPA or the ARPU. And obviously there's lots of moving parts in there. There's the impact of EIP. There is the impact of mix change. But I think the market is also trying to see through those and figure out what the net movement is in terms of people pricing themselves up in the buckets and generating more ARPU versus some of the givebacks and the competitive pressure we are seeing inside the system at Verizon. If you could give us more color on how the net is moving on pricing inside the base, that would be helpful. Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Good. Thanks, David. So at first on the revenue guidance. So, look, I mean coming into this year we set a priority that we said we would protect our base, and I think if you look at the results of the first quarter and the second quarter, the churn speaks for itself, with four basis points improvement from the first quarter year-over-year and then the second quarter year-over-year with the 0.90% being the lowest churn rate in the last three years that we posted up.", "In addition, some of the other changes in the assumption fact is the take rate of Edge. I would tell you we never anticipated that Edge would accelerate as much as it has, and looking forward into 3Q being at 60%, that's much higher than we had anticipated but the market has moved us there. And quite honestly it's getting more and more confusing at the frontline so this really translates into simplicity for our customers in choosing the Edge plan, and that's where the market has gone, so that's where we need to compete. And then finally, from an upgrade perspective, going back to protection of our base, we're up 800,000 upgrades year-over-year. So more people are selecting the new price plans when they get a new handset, and that puts us on the Edge which obviously generates more equipment revenue and puts pressure on the service revenue. And coming into this year we knew that service revenue would dilute. We're seeing more dilution than we anticipated because more customers are selecting that Edge plan.", "But I think just a couple of things to keep in check here, because when you zero in on one metric, you're walking away with the wrong impression as to what's happening in the overall P&L. So first off, we generated growth in revenue of 5.3% in Wireless this quarter. So if you look at the first half of the year, that's $2.5 billion of revenue growth just in the first half. You annualize that, that's growth that's bigger than some Fortune 500 companies generate in the full year of revenue. So this is still a very healthy business and it goes to what the overall industry is as well. So there's a lot going on in the industry to generate more usage in the future.", "So if you look at the IARPA which is the installment plus the revenue per account we're up 2.3%. So if you just focus in on the service revenue, of course that's going to dilute year-over-year, but I think you have to step up and look at the overall financials of Verizon Wireless. In addition, if you look at the connections, we're up 4.3% year-over-year in connections and we're also up in accounts. So when you look out to the future you're adding accounts, you're adding devices, that's also going to be more usage on the network. And obviously the whole future of the industry is based on generating more usage on the network so that people want to use more. And we know from a fact that more people are consuming more video on wireless today than they were a year ago. So that's all part of the strategy.", "You look at tablets, we're still less than 10% of the base in penetration of tablets. That's still another growth area for us. Then you look at Internet of Things. Internet of Things is still in early stages for the entire industry. There is more and more devices coming out that's going to generate revenue in the future. And then of course, if you just look at Verizon, we have the whole AOL and OTT launch, which we'll get to. We just launched Custom TV in Wireline, and that in itself will also put pressure on the top line.", "So if you think about the Custom TV package, customers are now only paying for what they want to view, and we're only paying the content providers for what our customers want to view. So what you're seeing is you're seeing a decrease in revenue, but you're also seeing a decrease in content cost that actually improves the profitability. So again, I think if you step back and you look at the entire portfolio of what's going on, I think you walk away with a very different conclusion than if you just look at the ARPU because we know that ARPU is going to get condensed with the new EIP plan. So thanks, David, for the question.", "David W. Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good morning. Fran, you talked a bit about productivity and cost initiatives earlier. Can you just update us on the steps you're taking to offset the dilution from the divestiture to Frontier next year? And perhaps in the context of that you can just update us on the union negotiations? I guess that deadline's coming up here shortly. Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Thanks, Simon. So on productivity and cost, look I mean we've been at this now for three years and our VLSS program, Verizon Lean Six Sigma program continues to generate savings. I mean if you just look at Wireline year-over-year down almost 8,000 employees from a year-over-year basis and still generating the great customer service and the volumes that we have there.", "So that speaks to the efficiency that we're getting both in the network efficiency side, reduction of over time, and of course as the industry matures now you're looking a lot of houses that already have an ONT on the side of the house. So it's less labor because you're just activating the house that now doesn't really need much of a truck roll to go to it. So there's a lot of efficiency there.", "In the Wireless side, a lot of concentration around self-serve and customer service centers. And then we go to structure around the Wireless unit. So we're still on that whole productivity cost routine and we still believe that we have a very full runway in front of us and you're going to continue to see us take cost out of this structure.", "If you just look at year-over-year on cash cost alone, if you look at our revenue growth versus cash cost we're really maintaining cash cost at a very slow incremental increase. So that speaks to the efficiency that we're driving through all of our initiatives.", "On the Frontier side we still have \u2013 we're expecting to close this transaction towards the end of the first quarter. So we still have about 8 months to 9 months of planning activity. We're well on our way, and I think what we've done in the past speaks for itself as how we'll address this in the future, and obviously I'll talk more about this as we get closer. But we are still designing those plans. Obviously you know Dan Mead is leading that team and he is very diligent in what he's doing to prepare us for the separation of that unit and getting our cost within alignment to offset the stranded cost perspective.", "On the union side of the house, just as we know there are in total 27 collective bargaining agreements covering about 38,000 people in nine Eastern states. We began formal negotiations on June 22 and to jump start the negotiations, the company put forth a comprehensive offer on the table, which included wage increases and changes to current contracts to help us manage our cost and increase our flexibility to better serve our customers.", "Simply stated, we will need to monetize at our legacy contracts to better position us to compete in the digital age. Given the level of change we are seeking with respect to benefit cost management as well as work rules, our expectation is that the negotiation process will take some time. As you know, it is not unusual for negotiations to continue well beyond the expiration date of the contract, which is August 1.", "We intend to work through the process until we achieve a new agreement that addresses the needs of our business and preserves the high quality of our jobs for our employees. So I think, David (sic) [Simon], as far as that goes, that's probably all I'm going to say around the union negotiations. It's early on and we still have a lot of work to do.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Marley, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks, guys. I guess, Fran, if you could start on expanding on Custom TV, any update on discussions with programmers there? And are people sort of \u2013 it seems like people are taking smaller packages than they would've otherwise. What's the average number of add-ons and any particular favorites that people are either walking away from or going to? And then second, just a housekeeping issue. I wonder if you can detail for us the impact of AOL on the P&L, just sort of rough numbers on the different areas and how you're going to report that going forward. Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Thanks, Phil. So on Custom TV, I mean obviously we know we were paving the path for a new venture here to give customers what they wanted. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any litigation matters currently in effect with Disney and ESPN as everyone knows that we're being sued on the contractual arrangement there. So I'm really not going to talk about that. But look, I mean we continue to have a great partnership with Disney and ESPN and we will continue to work through that disagreement in our business relationships.", "And I will tell you, if you just look at the over-the-top product, I mean ESPN is participating with college sports in that product. So we will continue to work with ESPN and the lawsuit will take its own course of action. And again, we believe we're in our contractual rights to offer what we're offering.", "From a customer selection perspective, I will tell you this has certainly exceeded our expectations. As we saw through the quarter once we launched this, we saw the uptake rate increase. As I said in my prepared remarks, over a third of the customers now coming in are selecting a Custom TV package. I will tell you that as far as the number of genres that they take, it's less than what we anticipated but they are selecting based on their own favorability and I'm not going to get into who selects what and how many we're doing there.", "But I will tell you that it is, it will put pressure on the top line but it obviously is going to improve our profitability here from a programming standpoint. So we will continue to work through that. The other thing I wanted to mention on just the growth metrics of FiOS here. As you know, given the disputes that we had in Custom TV, we also were blacked out from many content providers in advertising this product during the quarter. And in two of the biggest markets, both New York and Philadelphia, we were unable to advertise the Custom TV package for approximately 45 days until we worked through that.", "So that also contributed to some of the slower growth in FiOS because it took us out of market for that period of time during the quarter. And then of course in addition to that we had the Time Warner Cable separation of the merger, which both entrants came back into the market pretty competitively. So that put some pressure on this as well but even with that, we saw some great progress with the Custom TV package.", "On the second piece Phil of AOL, there is nothing included in AOL from a P&L perspective this quarter. We closed it at the end of the quarter. It was totally immaterial and from a cut off perspective it just wasn't materially enough for us to include. However, we did include the opening balance sheet. We've done a preliminary assessment on the fair value of the assets that we acquired. We had an independent third-party do that on a preliminary basis, and that is included in the balance sheet.", "So you'll see goodwill has increased for the acquisition as well as our customer list because there was value assigned to the subscription business of AOL. But from a P&L standpoint, there was no revenue or expenses included this quarter. That will be included for the first time in the third quarter and at this point, we will be including that in our overall corporate results for the remainder of this year. And then as I said before, we'll have to wait to see where we go with this \u2013 whether we include it as a separate viewable or we disclose revenues or how we're going to do that in the future, and I don't have an answer yet on that piece. So we'll wait till first quarter and entering into 2016 to give you more of a view into what happens going forward.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks, Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Marley, next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, and thanks for the comments on the retention efforts. Just as a follow-up to that, you've seen your churn rate in postpaid decline year-over-year for two quarters now. Do you have conviction you're going to be able to see your churn rate sort of stay at a low run rate for the balance of the year in light of your focus on it? And then just you noted that you are still planning on launching the mobile video service this summer. Are we going to see the full rollout this summer or is it going to be something that's going to be phased in over time and just along those lines, where are you with the adoption or the penetration of your multi-cast devices? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Thanks, Brett. So look, first on churn. We've made, as I said coming into this year we were really going to concentrate on protection of our base and I think we've shown that. If you just look at, and we don't really disclose this but if you just look at our basic churn rate, we've seen even double what we've seen in the overall churn rate improvement, so we are maintaining those basic phone customers and converting them into a 4G LTE smartphone device and we're seeing really good progress on that. And that's part of the $80 price point that we have in the market. It's been very, very successful for us in the retention of our customer base. But speaking on the churn piece, I just want to caution everybody, be careful because there is seasonality in the churn. So generally third quarter is a little bit higher than the second quarter but we do believe that we will still be able to improve on a year-over-year basis.", "As far as the over-the-top launch, we are absolutely going to be ready to go by late summer. It won't be the full entire of everything that we contemplate within the product set. It'll be an initial launch and as the year goes on, it will progress. So more to come on that but as you know, we have signed up a number of content providers, sports channels, DreamWorks, AwesomenessTV, Vice Media, Scripps, and of course we can't leave out the AOL content that's coming with the acquisition including HuffPost and TechCrunch. So we have a very good lineup. This is a lineup that is really around all live type news clips and sports and events, so very different than what anyone else is bringing to the marketplace. So more to come on that this summer from Marni and Tim Armstrong and his team who now owns this product set.", "And then on the multicast, again, as we go through this, all the phones that we sold in the fourth quarter have the capability of multicast other than the 6 and the 6 Plus, and we continue to feed the market with those multicast devices and I can't speak to exactly what the next iconic device will have in it so we'll have to wait to see what that comes out with but this will continue to grow over the next year to have a proliferation of units in the marketplace to make this matter as we continue on with our OTT launch.", "Brett Joseph Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question please, Marley.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks, and good morning. Two questions for me. Fran, first just a housekeeping item. I'm wondering if you could disclose the receivable amount for the equipment installment plan that you sold, both current and noncurrent at the end of the second quarter. And then more strategically, can you talk about how important the Wireline business is for the health and profitability of your Wireless business and how important it is or isn't to keep those two businesses together over time? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Michael. So first off on the receivable, we're fairly flat because keep in mind that we continue to securitize the receivable that removes that receivable from our books. So it's consistently flat between $2.5 billion to $3 billion so it really hasn't changed much. On the overall Wireline perspective, look, I mean, we've sold the three properties in the South, Texas, California and Florida because they were islands to us, very difficult properties to operate from our scale perspective. There's still a lot of copper in those footprints and Frontier does a much better job with that and strategically it just didn't fit for us.", "But, look, I think if anyone was to enter the broadband market the East Coast would be the first place that they would go. I mean we have an incredible footprint that stretches from Washington DC up through Boston. The broadband connection to those homes along with our Wireless product and the population of that segment is critical to us and it is a strategic asset for us to continue to market and launch with our Wireless product and over the top is going to feed into more of that as we go in here strategically. So right now, Lowell and I sit and we're very satisfied with the portfolio of assets we have. From an enterprise space, that enterprise asset is very critical to our enterprise customers, both from a Wireless and a Wireline perspective, so they're important relationships to us.", "So right now, I mean I'm not saying that if someone didn't come in and take a look at the assets \u2013 as we've always said, we're open to anything. But right now, strategically we are very satisfied with the asset portfolio we have and it's strategic to us. So right now we're content with what we have.", "Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks. Fran, maybe just a quick comment on margin pacing throughout the year now that we have more Edge uptake, just how we should be thinking about that typical fourth quarter seasonality?", "Second, on the Wireless side, anything on your radar with respect to leasing plans? And then just finally on the enterprise piece, I know you mentioned pricing and the competition there. Just trying to get a sense for, is there something going on that's incredibly irrational? Or is it just a byproduct, more competitive in certain areas? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. Thanks. So, Mike, on the margin pricing, look I think that the financials speak for themselves and of course we'll get a lot of flavor around how EIP helped the profitability and all this. Bit again, as Mike and I have continued to say, if you look at total revenue and the total EBITDA margin, that kind of neutralizes out the impact of the EIP and you see that we're increasing this year-over-year.", "And even if you look at Wireless margin at 56% in this quarter, even if you normalize out the EIP benefit, you're still over 50% margins for that business. So I think it speaks to itself of the \u2013 we continue to be an \"and\" company. We're going to grow and we're going to generate the profitability and we're going to do this in a very disciplined manageable approach. And we've said that we felt that coming into the year that we would hold our margins given all the competitive pressures, and we're still on track to do that.", "So I think the margin itself speaks for itself. And from a seasonality standpoint the one thing I would say going back to the change in the revenue guidance is, as we look out into the fourth quarter, keep in mind fourth quarter last year was an unusually very high volume quarter that generated a lot of equipment revenue, and the bulk of our sales were still in the equipment subsidy model. And that hovered around the new 6 and 6 Plus that came out. I just don't see that the next iconic device is going to be substantially different and therefore, I don't see that \u2013 and this is just me speaking, I don't see the volume there in the fourth quarter that we had last year from a total iconic change of the 6 and the 6 Plus. So I think that will also benefit us from just a margin perspective.", "On Wireless and leasing plans, look this is \u2013 the leasing plan is just a fancy way to do installment plans. But of course you get another accounting benefit by putting assets up on your books and being able to amortize them below the EBITDA line. So at this point, we have no plans to do any type of leasing arrangement.", "And then on the enterprise side, look, as I've said before, 2015 would look like 2014. I still do see some glimmers of hope here especially in the government sector where we're starting to sign some large contracts. But as you know in this business, I sign a large contract today, it takes me at least 12 months to implement that before I start to see the revenue benefit. So I'm looking that there could be some positives here going into 2016 on the enterprise side. Obviously it's being impacted by FX right now.", "But this is a very competitive environment with thousands of players who have niches. We do very well on the security side of the house. We're doing well in the data center side on the whole cloud services. But these revenue streams are just not large enough to offset the price compression that we're seeing in IP. But again, I see some glimmers of hope in IP, where maybe it's starting to stabilize again and if that happens then we should see some improvement. But right now it would be a cautious outlook from me.", "Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. First on the Edge take rate, Fran, how high can this go over time? You gave the guidance for 60% next quarter but do you see a time where in the not-too-distant future you could phase out subsidized plans and move all towards these Edge plans? And then the other number that stuck out was the lower churn. You talked about some of the efforts to lower churn. Do you think you can maintain this level of sort of below 1% going forward? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Thanks, John. So on the Edge take rate, look, I mean this is where the market has gone. If you look at all the advertising in the market, it's around the access point, and this is where we're at. So I think that where we're going to end up here is you'll never get to 100% overall because of corporate accounts and so forth. They're not going to take an installment type plan. So I don't think we ever get to \"100%\" in our base.", "But from a consumer standpoint, yes, I could see us getting to where we're more heavily, very heavily concentrated on the installment side of the house, and quite honestly as I said from a frontline perspective it'd be much easier for them to just sell one product. So simplicity is important to us. So you're going to see us, as we gradually move through here, that the market is moving us there so we're eventually going to get there.", "From a churn perspective as I said, I think with all the programs we have going, we're making very good progress in our base. Our customers are loyal. You've seen us running our new ads and some of our customers are coming back to us because they were dissatisfied with where they went. So I think that this all proves to again, the basis of how Verizon Wireless has been successful and will continue to be successful is the quality of our network, the consistent performance that our network gives to our customers, and the breadth of that network across the United States. So that's really what it comes to and as I've said before, the number one reason a customer leaves you is because of quality of the network, price is number two.", "So the quality of the network still is overwhelmingly more important than price, not to say that customers are not price-sensitive but we think that we can continue to be very competitive and protect our high-value-base. So yes, I do think that we'll continue on this track.", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Marley, next question please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you very much and good morning folks. I'm wondering if we could switch gears a little bit in terms of the network investment strategy here, Fran. We start to hear things coming out of Washington \u2013 600 megahertz seems to be like pushing for early 2016 start. First of all, how do you think about the timing on the reality of that happening and how should we think about your strategy around the need for low band spectrum? And then sort of a bigger picture question here, I mean, clearly focus remains on providing a compelling network experience from your side particularly if I think about your CapEx investment and shifting towards Wireless. I was wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the technology evolutions that you folks are embracing. Clearly when we speak to folks sort of in the push to small cells perhaps some of the software defined networking at (51:35) which we haven't seen from any other players, and stuff along those lines to really try and optimize the network throughput, any additional color would be most helpful here?", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So thanks, Amir. So on the networks side as far as the incentive auction goes, yeah, the FCC is now saying that they're going to hold the auction first quarter of 2016, probably at the end of the first quarter of 2016. As you know, they had a meeting on July 16 where they were going to set the rules but that actually got postponed. So we'll have to wait to look at what the auction rules are and decide whether we're going to participate at the appropriate time. The only thing I would say is based on the AWS-3 auction, hopefully the \u2013 we have some lessons learned on what we shouldn't do with a multi-billion-dollar companies giving favorable treatment so we'll have to see where these assessments come out.", "As far as our strategy here, the need for low-band spectrum for us is not a great need. As you know, we build out our LTE on the 700 megahertz which is contiguous across the United States, which is a competitive advantage for us. We then launched our AWS-1 spectrum for capacity and now we're in the process of revamping our 1900 PCS. So the key here is to keep in mind that of our licensed portfolio, only 40% of our licensed portfolio supports LTE and 87% of the data traffic is now running through LTE. So if you look at our 1900 megahertz, the yet to be deployed AWS-3 which we bought and will be deployed over the next probably 2.5 years out and then our build strategy, which we came out of the auction within Chicago and New York, we have plenty of capacity to deal with the ramping of what we believe will happen with our OTT product and the continued pursuit of volume in the industry.", "So our buildout is on track. We do not necessarily need low band spectrum but that doesn't mean that we would not participate in the incentive auction. Again, we'll have to wait for the rules to come out but obviously we are continuing down the track that we set on coming out of the AWS-3 auction. So at that point we'll have to wait to see what happens with the FCC.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Amir, thank you. Marley, we have time for one more question and if you could queue that up, I appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks, Fran. Following up on Amir's question on spectrum, in the past you have said you would consider a longer-term lease agreement with a potential partner. Is that still the case? Or given your recent comments just now about capacity, what are your current thoughts on any sort of longer-term lease agreement?", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah thanks, Jennifer. Well, I always say you never say never, right? So look \u2013 I mean, we're open to any options, but as far as the leasing of spectrum goes, as I said before, in order to protect the viability of our network and our planning and our capital allocation, this would have to be almost a lease in perpetuity so that you could never be held hostage by anybody because once you deploy a spectrum in your network, if somebody turned around 10 years from now and said, I think I'm not going to lease that to you any more, that would be detrimental to your business, and you can't just \u2013 you just can't let that happen. So I guess under the right terms, and conditions it would be something that we could look at, but I would tell you I think that's very, very difficult given the asset that you're leasing here.", "So I think that's the perspective, and we're concentrating on our build. The one thing I didn't answer on Amir's question was SDN, and we're into that. I mean, obviously, LTE in itself is a software-developed network and it gives you the scalability of giving richer network experiences, and our team is working on that and we've been working on that for quite some time. So there's a lot of things that will bring efficiency to the network. I mean, there's CRAN out there. We are in the initial \u2013 obviously 5G is being talked about in the industry, of course Asia is involved in 5G and of course we will start to get involved in the standard-setting around 5G. So there's a lot happening in this industry from a technology standpoint, so spectrum's important, it will always be important, but it's not the only tool we have in our toolbox. So from that perspective, we're concentrating on that strategy that we outlined coming out of the AWS-3 auction.", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks, Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Hey, Marley, thank you, but before we end the call I'd like to turn the call back to Fran for some final comments.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Thanks, everybody, and again thank you for joining us this morning. I'd just like to end though at, through the first half of 2015 we continue to execute on the fundamentals, we position our business for the future and we always return value to our shareholders.", "On a comparable basis, first half's consolidated revenues grew 3.5%, earnings grew 12.6%, cash flow from our operations was up 11.9%, Wireless revenues increased over $2.5 billion to just under $45 billion. We positioned ourselves for future growth, we acquired valuable mid-band spectrum in the FCC auction, invested $8 billion in capital year-to-date and made a very strategic acquisition in AOL. AOL acquisition greatly accelerates our digital media and advertising platform capabilities, which will become a critical element of our OTT strategy and our revenue growth for the future. We returned $9 billion to our shareholders through the first half of this year, $4 billion in dividends and $5 billion in an ASR program. We certainly look forward to a very positive second half of 2015 with confidence and our ability to execute our strategy and create value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees. Thank you again for joining us today, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions]", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski and I'm here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I'd like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide two. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on the website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran goes through our results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2015 we reported earnings of $0.99 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a non-cash pre-tax charge of $342 million or $0.05 per share for a pension remeasurement adjustment due to a settlement accounting threshold that was met in the third quarter.", "Excluding the effect of this non-operational item, adjusted earnings per share was $1.04 for the third quarter compared with $0.89 a year ago, or a growth of 16.9%. There were no special items of a non-operational nature in the third quarter of 2014.", "Through the first nine months adjusted earnings totaled $3.10 per share compared with $2.65 per share last year. However, as we've consistently pointed out, last year's adjusted EPS would've been higher on a non-GAAP illustrated basis if we assumed 100% Wireless ownership for the entire first quarter. On this more comparable basis, the adjusted EPS growth rate was about 14% for the first nine months of 2015. As a reminder our Wireline results include the operations in the three states that we agreed to sell to Frontier. These operations will be included until the transaction closes, which we expect at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Also as previously noted, we are no longer recording depreciation expense on these assets as they are classified as held for sale.", "We continue to estimate that the full year 2015 earnings benefit of lower depreciation expense will be about $0.13 per share. In terms of the AOL acquisition, which closed in late June, our third quarter consolidated results include the operations of AOL, which are reported as part of corporate and other. We have not restated prior history to periods prior to the third quarter of 2015, and will not include AOL results.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter and year-to-date results demonstrate that we continue to execute on the fundamentals of our business and deliver strong financial performance, which actively positioning the business for future growth and profitability.", "We are very committed to building the business for the future and we are doing so through investments in our existing networks, as well as the platforms that will position us to capture incremental profitable growth in new areas like mobile video and the Internet of things.", "We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model. In addition to our consistent investment strategy, we are also committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have had a very active year with capital investments in spectrum purchases, which position us for the future growth, the strategic acquisition of AOL and the return of more than $11 billion in value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, where remaining on track with our previously stated deleveraging plan.", "In early September, our board of directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase, which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows. ", "On the operational front, our focus is to provide customers with consistent network reliability and a great customer experience, and we are competing very effectively in all parts of the business. We once again delivered strong earnings growth and free cash flows. In Wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net ads, as well as net phone addition. ", "Postpaid net ads totaled 1.3 million, which does not include any wholesale or Internet of things connections. Net phone add additions were 430,000. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.93%, down 7 basis points from last year. Total Wireless revenue grew 5.4% and our EBITDA margin expanded.", "Our Wireline quarterly results were highlighted by FiOS revenue and customer growth, with sequential increases in both in Internet and video subscribers. Our segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 50 basis points. ", "Now, let's get into our third quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide four. Total operating revenue was $33.2 billion, an increase of 5%, which as Mike indicated, includes revenues from AOL. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 3.1%. Our consolidated revenues have been consistently driven by customer and usage growth in both Wireless and FiOS.", "Our overall revenue mix continues to change, driven by the unsubsidized equipment model, increasing video demand in Wireless and a higher mix of broadband and FiOS. As these trends evolve over the near-term we expect future revenue growth to result from increased video and Internet of things traffic, enabling new business models in wireless and continued broadband demand in Wireline.", "In terms of our mobile video strategy earlier this month we were the first to market with the commercial launch of go90tm, a differentiated, mobile-first social entertainment platform. Go90 includes a broad selection of premium content and social engagement features, and the capability for sharing and conversation around the content. The initial feedback has been strong with increasing engagement without significant promotion, and we have received positive industry recognition.", "As go90 develops, we will be adding more great content, features and advertising opportunities. You can expect a flow of product enhancements creating a new ecosystem for digital creators and advertisers, and a video consumption model that we can monetize in multiple ways. AOL is expected to play a key role in the success of our video strategy. The acquisition of AOL significantly improves our digital media and advertising capabilities. These capabilities will be a key component of our video business model, which will be driven by digital mobile advertising in the future.", "We are taking a strong leadership position in the Internet of things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications we are creating an ecosystem that will foster innovation and expand the entire IoT market. Here are few examples of our early initiatives. In August we announced the commercial availability of Hum, an aftermarket vehicle technology and subscription service creating a connected car driving experience that can operate in more than 150 million vehicles in the United States. We are very active in Smart City solutions market and we have already announced a partnership with the city of Savannah, Georgia. Municipalities like Savannah are looking to take advantage of our intelligent solutions to integrate its parent systems, monitor traffic and safety conditions in real-time to improve efficiency and public safety. These are just a few examples of the many opportunities we are pursuing.", "We are very well positioned to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both the ubiquity of mobile service and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. This will enable us to monetize usage through new commercial models, include data analytics and applications. New revenue streams from the Internet of things continued to emerge and grow with revenues of $175 million in the quarter and about $495 million year-to-date.", "As our revenue mix expands we are focused on improving the customer experience while reducing our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. The focus on cost structure has enabled us sustain a strong earnings profile. ", "Consolidated EBITDA totaled $11.9 billion, up 7.5% on an adjusted basis, and our adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 80 basis points to 35.8%. ", "Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide five. Cash flows from operations were $9.5 billion in the third quarter, and totaled $28.4 billion year-to-date. The nine-month total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to the tower monetization transaction, which is nonrecurring.", "In the third quarter, we continued to securitize Wireless equipment installment receivables and received about $2 billion in cash proceeds. Free cash flow for the first nine months, excluding the tower proceeds, totaled $13.5 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.4 billion in the quarter and $12.5 billion year-to-date. We expect capital expenditures for 2015 to be within our stated range of $17.5 billion to $18 billion.", "Our balance sheet remained strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $112.3 billion of gross debt, net debt of $108.4 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.4 times. ", "Now, let's move into a review of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide six. In the Wireless business, revenue growth, profitability, and cash flows are driven by our high-quality retail postpaid customer base. Total Wireless operating revenues grew 5.4% in the quarter to $23 billion. Service revenue of $17.6 billion declined 4.1% while equipment revenue increased to $4.3 billion, up 73%. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.2%.", "Service revenue growth will continue to be pressured and equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device installment plans increase and more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing. In early August, we simplified our pricing structure centered on the device installment model. The pricing change simplified the customer experience at the point of sale and provided a cleaner structure for managing their accounts.", "Existing customers can still choose to sign a two year service contract and remain on subsidized pricing when upgrading to a new device. Additionally, business customers do not generally select device installment plans. Consistent with our expectations, the percentage of phone activations on installment plans grew to about 58% in the third quarter compared with 49% in the second quarter, and 12% in the third quarter of last year.", "In the fourth quarter, we expect the percentage of phone activations on device installment plans to increase to around 70%. During the quarter, 5.6 million phones were activated on device installment plans. We have about 19 million device payment phone connections in total, representing approximately 22% of our postpaid phone base. Overall more than 30% of our postpaid phone customers are on unsubsidized service pricing. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 9.2%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 56.4%, up from 49.5%.", "As we have said before, we believe a more relevant measure of profitability is EBITDA as a percentage of total wireless revenue, which expanded to 43.2%, up 160 basis points. On a year-to-date basis, our EBITDA margin was 43.9%, up 100 basis points from a year ago.", "Now let's turn to Slide seven and take a closer look at Wireless connections growth. We ended the quarter with 110.8 million total retail connections. This total does not include any wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.9% to 105 million and our prepaid connections totaled 5.7 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.2 million. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.93% in the quarter, compared with 1% a year ago. ", "Each quarter this year we have improved our year-over-year postpaid churn rate between 4 and 7 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience through simplified pricing and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service calling rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction.", "Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.3 million were high quality. With a sequential improvement in the number of smartphone and total phone net adds, we added 889,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 694,000 net new smartphones.", "Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 430,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 818,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 80,000.", "Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide eight. Total postpaid device activations totaled 11.6 million in the quarter, down about 1.2%. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the quarter with 71.5 million smartphones in total and our smartphone penetration increased to more than 82% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 76% of our retail postpaid connections base. As you would expect, growth in 4G device adoption continues to drive increased data and video usage.", "Approximately 89% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network and overall traffic on LTE has increased by about 75% in the past year. About 7% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. The quality of our overall postpaid phone base continues to improve. Through gross adds and upgrades, our 4G phone base has increased by roughly 34% in the past 12 months to $64.6 million.", "We still have a sizable 4G upgrade opportunity with roughly 15 million basic phones and nearly 7 million 3G smartphones remaining in our postpaid connections base. Tablets are also under penetrated in our postpaid base at only 10%. Wireless capital spending totaled $2.9 billion in the quarter and $8.5 billion year-to-date, up 8.4% from a year ago.", "We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s best reliability and to position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are focused on improving our network capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effective management of our spectrum inventory and further densification in urban markets.", "Our densification program is progressing well and it is achieving the capacity gains that we expected on the spectrum that is in service. For example in Chicago, we are on our plan for small cell deployments covering key locations with distributed antenna systems and expanding our in-building coverage. This has helped support approximately 75% data growth on the network, while maintaining our number one ranking in network quality according to both internal and external competitive benchmark studies.", "National studies continued to consistently rate Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader. We lead in what matters most to customers, coverage and consistent reliable performance. Densification is just one aspect of our network evolution strategy. We are working on centralizing network radio control to enhance capacity and provide operational efficiencies, while beginning to implement a software defined network architecture, laying the groundwork for new innovative services and applications.", "We are extending our network leadership into 5G with our announcement several weeks ago that we are leading the technology forum with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standard developments and appropriate requirements for the next generation of wireless technology.", "Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide nine. In the consumer business, FiOS continues to be the driver of revenue growth, and now represents 79% of consumer revenue. In the third quarter consumer revenue grew 2.8% and mass markets, which include Small Business, grew 1.8%. As we expected, there was a change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory. The primary reason for the decline is driven by lower paid TV subscriber growth, and an increase in customers rightsizing their existing bundles.", "While FiOS broadband continues to grow, we are seeing a decline in the percentage of triple play customers. In addition, we continue to see interest in our custom TV offering, which offers more choice and control at a lower price point. We expect the continued adoption of custom TV will pressure revenue growth, but result in a higher contribution margin.", "In the third quarter, FiOS consumer revenue grew 7.1% driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. Our Quantum broadband service continues to scale and because there are no content costs has a higher profitability contribution. At the end of the quarter, roughly two-thirds of our consumer FiOS Internet customers subscribed to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher. We are seeing the highest rate of growth in the 75 megabit speed tier, where one fourth of our Quantum customers currently subscribed.", "As I highlighted earlier, FiOS subscriber growth improved sequentially in the third quarter. In broadband we added 114,000 net FiOS customers and now have a total of 6.9 million FiOS Internet subscribers, representing 41.7 penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 2000 in the quarter. ", "In video, we added 42,000 net customers in the quarter and now have a total of 5.8 million FiOS video subscribers, which represents 35.6% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier to finalize the sale of our Wireline properties in Florida, Texas and California, and to obtain the necessary regulatory approvals and ensure a seamless transition. We are making good progress and have secured for approvals from the DOJ, SEC and the State of Texas. We expect to close a deal at the end of the first quarter of 2016.", "As we prepare to divest these properties, we are focused on reducing our shared cost structure post transaction. In addition, we will also take this opportunity to significantly reduce the broader cost structure of the entire Wireline business. ", "Let's turn to Slide 10 and cover Enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. In the Enterprise space, we continue to work through secular and economic challenges. In the third quarter, global Enterprise revenue declined 4.9% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 5.1% in the third quarter. In both businesses we continue to see similar trends impacting growth, with secular declines in legacy transport revenue and competitive price compression in other services.", "Total operating revenues for the entire Wireline segment were down 2.3% in the quarter. The segment EBITDA margin was 23.5%, up 50 basis points and on a year-to-date basis expanded 20 basis points to 23.2%. As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on expanding margins and improving the profitability of the Wireline segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure, while maintaining strong customer satisfaction.", "We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning, and are seeing improvements in productivity. We will continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations. Capital spending in the Wireline was $1.2 billion in the third quarter and totaled $3.4 billion year-to-date, down 18.6%.", "Let's move next to our summary slide. Throughout 2015 we have executed on the fundamentals of the business, growing high value customers and delivering strong financial and operating results and generating free cash flows. We have also continued to consistently invest in our networks and platforms to position us for the future growth. Our year-to-date consolidated revenue growth was 3.3%, after adjusting for the inclusion of AOL this quarter and the sale of the public sector business in 2014. On the same basis, we continue to expect revenue growth of at least 3% for the full year 2015.", "Our adjusted EBITDA was up 6.4% with margin expansion of 80 basis points to 36.6%. Excluding the Tower proceeds, cash flows from operations were up about 13% year-to-date and free cash flow totaled $13.5 billion. We have added 3 million net postpaid Wireless subscribers, including total phone net adds of 613,000. Our new customer growth is high quality with 2.4 million new 4G smartphone customers and 2.5 million new 4G tablets.", "We have also improved the quality of our postpaid base through upgrades and effective customer retention and have approximately 10 million more 4G smartphone customers than we did at the beginning of this year. In FiOS broadband, we have added 319,000 new subscribers, and 158,000 in FiOS video. We are very focused on developing new products and services in mobile video and the Internet of things to monetize usage on our networks and expand our revenue mix. In time, these incremental revenues will become more meaningful to our overall top line growth.", "The launch of new products like go90 and Hum are examples of where we can monetize usage of the network and platform layers, providing more diversity to future revenue streams. ", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you, Fran. Brad, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Simon Flannery", "Thanks very much. Good morning Fran. I think Lowell had talked recently about earnings plateauing in 2016. Could you just give us a little bit more color about the puts and takes with the Frontier divestiture and \u2013 during the end of the first quarter and all the cost cutting. And then any updates on the [600] auction given that the application rules came out last week? Thank you.", "FranShammo", "Sure. Good morning Simon.", "Simon Flannery", "Good morning.", "FranShammo", "So on the comment about the plateau of earnings, I guess it is first off, let us start with this simple piece, which is \u2013 some of which is just pure math. So when you look at this wireless model, and converting from a subsidized phone model to an installment plan model, as we have been pretty transparent with all of you, there was a GAAP accounting that falsely increased the earnings of any company who adopted this model, and that we have tried to be as transparent as possible giving you the baseline in the beginning, but that became more complicated.", "And what we have said going forward is look, the better measurement here is not service margin EBITDA but regular EBITDA percent on total revenue because that kind of normalizes out the fact that we are now recording 100% of the revenue upfront for the sale of the equipment, rather than a subsidy and then recouping that through service pricing over a period of time.", "So when you take that into consideration, as you plan out the curve on the installment sale and penetration of the base, and I said in my prepared comments, our base is \u2013 30% of our base is already on this new pricing. So as you go into \u201916 and you get into that 50%, it starts to normalize out the earnings impact that was accelerated through the year 2015. So I guess what I would say is if you took out the impact of that in \u201915, and you look at \u201914 to \u201915 earnings growth, you would probably get a more normal growth trend than what we are delivering in double-digit growth now and then if you put that normalization to the \u201916, we actually would have grown earnings, but because of the math exercise here, you are getting the flatness in that GAAP accounting.", "So that is part of it. The next piece of it is as we have said also with the divestiture of the", "Frontier properties in the [South], these are classified as properties for discontinued operations. And for the year, we're anticipating that's going to be a $0.13 to $0.14 EPS lift, because we discontinue the depreciation of those properties. So, again that has to get normalized out as we go into '16. So, if you looked at it today, we are reporting $3.10 to-date. We have about a $0.11 of benefit. So, it'd be around a $2.99 versus $2.65 of last year.", "The next thing is, if you look at the divestiture of those properties as we've said, these are higher margin properties, and since we are more of a centralized cost based company, we have a lot of allocations into those three property. So, as I said before when we announced the sale, we have this what we call stranded cost that we need to work out of the business since the time that we announced this.", "I think we've proven a great track record here at wireline, that we know how to do this. If you look at year-over-year, we are down over 8,000 resources because of all the system enhances and profits improvements that we've made through processes and frontline execution on more online billing and so forth. So, we know how to do this and we got about five more months to go, but we also have to consider the fact that we're in the middle of a labor negotiation and some of those benefits won't be realized until we come to an agreement with the labor.", "So, this is more of a timing issue on this one. We will realize those benefits, as you know the last time we entered into a labor negotiation, we said that we would incur about $500 million worth of savings over the three years. And you can see that coming through the EBITDA of wireline. So, I think that's important.", "Then of course the last piece of this is, as you can see in our results this quarter, you're seeing more of a ramp in corporate for the start-up businesses. So, as any start-up business goes, you incur losses upfront, because you're investing in the product development, you're investing in the marketing and the promotional of that new business. And that's going to be a drag on earnings through '16 because the revenue will not kind of catch up with the cost.", "So, when you take all that into the consideration, that's where low was mentioning and forecasting more of a flat if you will or flat-toe for 2016.", "Simon Flannery", "And that's the GAAP --", "Fran Shammo", "And just chiming on the update of the 600 megahertz. As you know, application to participate as buyers, the FCC did some forward part of the auction and which are expected to be due in January. And the whole purpose of this was to give the broadcast or is a sense of what the bid would be that they would receive. And now the broadcast was how that chance to look at that and decide whether they're going to participate or not.", "I think one important thing here, though, too, is that after we saw the abuse in the AWS-3 Auction by Dish, I think the FCC should learn from this and not give preferences to large corporations, award credits or set aside and the government shouldn't be in the business of picking winners and losers. Let the consumer do that. So we'll have to see how the rules play out here but at this point, we do plan to participate but we'll see how the rules play out and then we will go from there.", "Simon Flannery", "Thank you.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, we're ready for the next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "David Barden", "Hey guys, good morning. Thanks. Maybe two questions if I could. Just, first on the Fran disclosure about the 22% devices be on EIP plans but 30% of customers being on EIP pricing. Could you talk about the difference there, is that BYOD, is that a forward pricing strategy that you are starting to implement? It'll be helpful to understand that.", "And then just second on the, we unfold the go90 strategy and think about content acquisition. Now that AT&T and DTV are together, is there any thought about revisiting Verizon's historical kind of conversations with the cable industry about maybe joining forces to try to work together on content and distribution and allocation of resources? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Hi, thanks David. Good morning. So, on the difference between the 22% on edge and the 30% on pricing, obviously, if customers have fulfilled their contract over the two year period time under the old subsidized model, those customers are free and always have been free to select whatever price plan they want and we are allowing them to move to the new pricing because they fulfilled their contractual obligation under the old pricing.", "So, in essence they are bringing their previous device into the new pricing. So, that\u2019s part of it. The other thing is that, there is a little bit of forward pricing here with current customers and as we talked before on calls, we have pretty diligent exercise where we go through our customer base and we attack the high value customers who we think will have a higher propensity to churn from us.", "So, there is some proactiveness there. And I think you're seeing that come through on the reduction of churn through this year of 4 basis points to 7 basis points. And I would anticipate the going into the fourth quarter, you should consider us to be within that improvement on a year-over-year basis. Now, given the fourth quarter is always a generally a higher churn quarter as it was last year, but we do believe that we will see a consistent improvement as we have seen through the beginning of this year.", "As far as go90, look, go90 is a very different product set. It's mobile first, a social entertainment platform. Let me just talk a little bit about where we are here. But this really is just a totally different perspective than linear TV and content deals. And we know how to do that and we've been doing that for 10 years with files.", "But this is a very different platform. Keep in mind we are 20 days into this. We actually haven't done any advertising or promotion activity around this product. So, for early stages, we are seeing very good platform stability. We are seeing very encouraging feedback. And of course we're looking at some very specific matrix here of what's the viewership, how many times do people revisit the site, and what do the new shows capture.", "And if you haven't downloaded, I would encourage you to, because we now have over 10,000 assets in the product. We have two exclusive episodes; one is called Top Five Live and the other one is called Betch - \"B-E-T-C-H\". And these are really starting to take form with the Millennials. And we are starting to see a number of encouraging revisits to the platform on a daily basis to see what Top Five Live and Betch are doing. And we have 48 more exclusive content deals coming that will be on this product before the end of the quarter.", "So, go90 right now we are seeing very good upstage but again we really haven't started to advertise the platform. We do have entertainers tweeting the platform who are part of the platform like Kanye West on his live show. So, there is a lot happening in this platform. So, we are really pleased with the initial stages, but this is very different than the legacy linear TV model. So, I will stop there, David. Thanks for the question.", "David Barden", "Thanks Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Phil Cusick", "Hey guys, thanks. Fran, can you talk about the Custom TV effort and what you are seeing overall in the video landscape. It seems like the 42,000 this quarter was a little bit weaker than we would have thought, given seasonality. I wonder if you are still having any advertising issues or if this is just the way we should look at it going forward? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Phil, good morning. The TV environment this past quarter was extremely competitive and continues to be. Custom TV, though, actually within the portfolio is performing similar to what it did last quarter, with the number of people choosing the product and the number of migrations that we have within the product. And of course, as we said, this is going to put a little bit of topline pressure on FiOS growth. And the reason for that is the way I have to think about this is the new bundle is about $20 less than the average normal FiOS bundle.", "But the offset to that is we are also getting an incremental benefit in the content cost. So, we're seeing an incremental margin gain by people selecting the Custom TV package. I think what is more important though is the consumers are speaking to the total linear environment that says \"they only want to pay for what they want to watch and they don't want to pay for 300 channels when they watch only about 10% of those channels.\" So, I think that\u2019s more important is to where the ecosystem is going.", "We will continue to support Custom TV. As we said we know we have some disputes that we're working through but Custom TV right now is doing what we thought it would do. As far as the growth perspective, I think, if you look at last quarter with the negative 625,000 negative adds, we continue to be positive, so we are gaining share, but look the environment is Millennials don't want linear TV content.", "They are disconnecting their cable for just internet content and mobile content and that goes to why we are launching go90 with the mobile first perspective and that\u2019s attacking that entire segment that FiOS brand does not attack today through our linear TV product.", "Phil Cusick", "Thanks. When you reported the second quarter, you talked about Custom TV, most people were taking only the basic sort of 55. Have you seen that evolve upward a little bit as we're seeing for both season and other things starting to form?", "Fran Shammo", "Phil, no, we haven't. The basic package is the basic and then you get two packages included. Now, of course you have a selection of those package among seven. Some people are selecting the sports, others are selecting the live like Hallmark station and those things. Yes, generally sports fanatics generally take a premium package. So Custom TV more is for those folks who really aren't interested in sports and are taking less of the sports channels but it's more or less the same trend not seeing any difference there.", "Phil Cusick", "Got it. Thanks, Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.", "John Hodulik", "Good day, thanks. Back to wireless, Fran, if we could. You had a handset upgrade rate of about 7% which is down slightly on a year-over-year basis. But there is a much better comp coming up in the fourth quarter of '14. We did almost 10%. Do you expect a bigger sort of year-to-year decline in the fourth quarter here and if so what kind of impact could that have on the margins? And then if you could give us a sense for how you expect given the trends you are seeing with installment plans '16 over '15, would be great. Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, John. So, on the handset piece for upgrades. What I would say is we are anticipating a little less volume than last year because of the total iconic launch of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. But this quarter we are still anticipating a fairly heavy volume quarter as every fourth quarter is, but I would anticipate a little less than what we saw last year. So, I would think that upgrades would be a little less than what we ran last year. As far as what we see from a take rate on installments going into 2016, look, at this point we are guiding to 17% in the fourth quarter.", "We are now 100% at the point of sale with Edge only. Of course, we have an exemption for current customers who are on the subsidy model who can opt to take a new subsidized handset. So, I'll have to see how that works going into 2016 and that may keep us around that 70% to 75% take rate but it's too early to tell. So, I don't really want to give guardianship on what the take rate will be. Let\u2019s see how we come out the fourth quarter, I will readdress that in the first quarter.", "John Hodulik", "Great. Thanks, Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Mike McCormack", "Hi guys, thanks. Fran, just thinking about the uptake of factoring -- of EIP and looking into next year, you have got two competitors getting very aggressive on leasing. Just a sense for your thoughts on leasing as a structure and then secondly the prepaid declined, is that just sort of defocusing on that segment or you are actually seeing some wins on the postpaid side from the prepaid base? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Yes, thanks Mike. So, on the EIP, yes we have gone to the full Edge product. As I've said before, I am not interested in a rental program. We are not seeing any impact from those programs from the competitors in our base and I think our results speak to that this quarter and I think they'll speak to that in the fourth quarter as well. I think what you'll see is if you speak to the rating agencies, they are becoming very concerned with the balance sheet risk of some of the industry on putting up rental phones on the balance sheet with what the residual value will be with those rental phones.", "So, again, as I have said before, that\u2019s not something that we are entertaining at this point. Again, I never say \"never say never\" but that is not something that I would have an appetite for. On the prepaid decline, I think, look, generally if you look at how postpaid and the price points of postpaid and I've talked about this before. Postpaid pricing is more or less mirroring what prepaid pricing was in the past. And we are seeing some migration of our prepaid product customers to postpaid, but it's more probably limited than some others because of our intense credit models and you have to pass the credit in order to become postpaid.", "But there is a segment of prepaid customers that are good credit customers, that now that the price point is closer to affordability for them on postpaid, they are moving into the postpaid product. So, I don't really look into the prepaid product decline as a problem set for us at this point. We generally really compete with prepaid in our reseller model with companies like TracFone and StraightTalk and Straight Wireless and that\u2019s where we really drive home the lower-end product without our brand connected to it.", "So, and that although we don't disclose much in reseller any more, that segment continues to perform well for us.", "Mike McCormack", "I guess, Fran, on the residual risk, because that\u2019s just you think secondary market can become softer or new devices being launched or is it just an overall view on risk in the balance sheet?", "Fran Shammo", "If you look at some of the programs, you have balloon payments that are doing 18 months. 18 months from now the market is changing. There is a lot of Apple product hitting in the Chinese market now, where China was one of the larger areas where we sold off used handsets. So, as these markets get heavily penetrated with newer product, that could impact the residual value of these phones going forward. So, it's just a risk that it's going to have to be handled by the industry under that program and at this point that\u2019s not something we want to deal with.", "Mike McCormack", "Great. Thanks, Fran.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Investment Research. Your line is open.", "Michael Rollins", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two, if I could. First, Fran, could you talk a little bit more about what the mobile data usage looks like. You talked about the mix of data that's on 4G LTE, I am kind of curious how much does the customer use, how much is the data growing year-over-year in that metric set; you can help on that basis. And then, secondly, you described that the service revenue plus installment billing was 1.2% up year-over-year. As you're making the transition to these new great plans, the unbundled installment plans, what\u2019s the risk, does that goes lower before it goes higher? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, Michael. On mobile data, what we are seeing right now is that the trend across our entire network of 75% growth year-over-year, obviously, some of the metropolitan areas like in New York and Chicago are higher than that. I mean, Chicago we said is up 75% but New York, San Francisco, some others are higher than that in growth rate. So, it depends where you are at and then we have markets obviously lower than that because of more of rural areas.", "So, that\u2019s generally what we are seeing in the network right now. On the installment sale billings of 1.2%, yes, I do believe that will go lower as we make this transition into 50% of our base for installment sale. So, the trend of service revenue and the installment billings plus the service is going to continue to decline, until we get into that middle part latter part of 2016 where the curve will reverse and then you will start to see that flattening out and start trending back up just like the math would dictate.", "Michael Rollins", "And could that go negative?", "Fran Shammo", "I am sorry? Go ahead.", "Michael Rollins", "Could it actually be a rate of decline, during this transition?", "Fran Shammo", "No. I think what you are seeing now if you look at the previous quarters, it's pretty trending about the same. I don't think it's going to accelerate.", "Michael Rollins", "Thank you.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, next question, please.", "Operator", "Certainly. Our next question is from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you, very much. And good morning Fran and Mike.", "Fran Shammo", "Good morning, Amir.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "I was wondering if we might be able to discuss a bit more about your midterm thoughts on the competitive landscape. For some time, of course, we've seen the impact of increased competition in the market with respect how devices are sold, pricing of services, etcetera. And at least from our end the most draconian fears have yet to be realized.", "As we head into 2016, both of the comparatively smaller carrier seem to be positioning themselves to be levering up here, albeit one of them synthetically through the lease company. With that in mind, are we potentially entering a period in which the focus may increasingly shift towards increased returns versus one that\u2019s overly emphasizing competition and if so how do you believe you can fare in that type of environment?", "Fran Shammo", "Amir, first of all, let\u2019s set the stage that the wireless industry has always been very competitive. And even through all this competitiveness, the industry themselves continues to grow even though everyone thinks that the industry is slowing we continue to have net adds overall. Tablets become a bigger piece, data continues to grow. So, the industry overall although very competitive, continues to grow despite all that.", "Our focus has always been competing on a network quality, reliability and simplicity. And that\u2019s how we have been winning for the past 18 years and that\u2019s our focus going forward. And you can see that with our new brand campaign, better matters, because what we believe with our brand in our campaign is we're trying to send the message that although some say video and data are not as important and people are willing to get disrupted, I think if you talk to the Millennials, the thing that frustrates them the most is the spinning wheel when they want to watch a video or download something.", "So, our focus on our brand is better does matter. We have the best network, we are the most reliable, and we become a more simple company to deal with our simplicity of pricing. So, that\u2019s where we look to compete. I think the fourth quarter will be a competitive quarter as it always is every year. I think you're going to see promotions in the marketplace and this industry is going compete as we always have.", "But I think our differentiation is how we differentiated ourselves through this whole entire process of installment sale and now rental and as I said before the rental programs don't seem to be having any impact or appeasing to our customers. So, I would say that we will continue to do the same. As far as how the industry changes, I think what you are seeing from us is we're going in a different direction with our go90 launch. We are appealing to our Millennial population with our network and our products and I do think that as we said before you can only price down so much and then you need to generate cash,", "And I think as you said some have to start generating cash in order to invest in their networks to support the growth of the data or else things are going to start to fall apart. And I think you are starting to see some of that in some of the national RootMetrics drive test, where some of the networks are starting to feel pressure and starting to fall down in the ranking.", "We continue to invest heavily in our networks as I said before. You should continue to see us as a flat overall capital company but wireless continues to trend up and that\u2019s important for the product set that we are launching. So, I do think there will be more focus on returns and profitability and that\u2019s good for the industry.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you, very much for everything and then for color.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks. I then go back to the question I think David asked earlier about sort of your relationship with the cable industry. And one of the things that has come up is the MVNO agreement that you guys signed several years ago and because it was signed several years ago it's perceived to be maybe a little outdated.", "And so I am just curious, do you still feel comfortable with the agreement the way it structured. Do you feel like it's enabling the cable companies to do whatever they want? And are you open-minded if they approached you about redoing it if they felt that the industry has evolved to a point where the agreement was stale and was not likely to create value for either you or for them?", "Fran Shammo", "Well, I think that you stated, Brett. We have an existing MVNO agreement and we were informed that they are going to execute on that agreement and the agreement is the agreement. I am not going to get into whether we're discussing of revising the agreement or the terms and conditions of that, since it's under NDNA and we will see how this plays out. Obviously the industry is moving. Cable is going to do what they are going to do and we're going to do what we're going to do.", "I think that again though what I would say is we truly believe that Wi-Fi is a complementary wireless network if you will with LTE and we don't believe one replaces the other. Just like when we launched LTE, we said \"look it's not going to replace Wi-Fi, it's not going to replace broadband into the home.\" Similar, Wi-Fi is not going to replace LTE. So, I think that\u2019s where it stands right now, so, I really won't interject any more around the MVNO.", "Brett Feldman", "All right. Just a quick follow-up, since you mentioned Wi-Fi and I was thinking about small sales. I think you had earlier said you are looking to deploy unlicensed LTE maybe in trial phases, I think either this year or early next year. Where are you on that?", "Fran Shammo", "We are right on course. We are actually testing in the labs now and we are looking to deploy some time in 2016. And again, the unlicensed LTE is a great piece for us to increase our capacity. And again, another differentiator between LTE and Wi-Fi, is LTE is a fully managed network, Wi-Fi is not. So, when you start to load up Wi-Fi, that\u2019s why you start to see real degradation in service, whereas, with LTE and then overlaying unlicensed LTE. We can dynamically increase capacity when we see that that capacity needing increase. So, it's going to be a very viable tool for us in order to increase capacity without deploying a lot of dollars.", "Brett Feldman", "Great. Thanks for taking the question.", "Fran Shammo", "Brad, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of Moffett Nathanson. Your line is open.", "Craig Moffett", "Hi, good morning. Two questions, if I could. First, you talked a little bit about the upcoming options. I wonder if you could just talk a little bit about how you think about different spectrum bands at this point with the options I guess out there being 600 MHz from the option versus 2.5 GHz from Sprint that maybe per sale versus Charlie Ergen's spectrum that's mostly in the 2.1 range.", "And then if you could also just talk about on the wireline side. How do you think about your commitment to the wireline business in FiOS going forward with LTE coming into the New York market? Are you divesting some properties outside of the Northeast, is that still a meaningful focus or would you look to reduce your exposure to wireline if you had the opportunity?", "Fran Shammo", "Thanks, I appreciate it. On the auction and the spectrum bands, it's a good question because the current auction is 600 MHz band and as you know we deployed LTE contagiously on 700 MHz that doesn't mean that we can't operate with 600 MHz but 600 MHz and 700 MHz don't play well together. There is a lot of interference. So, where we have 700 MHz, there will be a lot of work to deploy a 600 MHz spectrum. But there is areas where we could use lower band spectrum but it's probably not the top priority.", "We like the higher band like AWS. We've said that all along that Charlie is sitting on very good spectrum. It's very good for capacity, which is why we spent $10.4 billion in the auction. But we also can do things like we've done in Chicago and New York, where we felt the license cost was way too high and we instead decided to deploy small cells and get capacity in a more reasonable cheaper way, if you will.", "Now, some of this spectrum will come back to market. We don't know how the FCC will treat that yet. So, we'll just wait and see but higher frequency spectrum is capacity and that\u2019s really what we need at this point in time.", "As far as the wireline commitment, look, I think with the three divestitures in the South, they were more or less footprints which were not contiguous to anything else. Most of that property was copper, not fiber. So, when we look at the East Coast, it's a much different footprint. I mean, we'll have covered over 70% of the footprint with our FiOS product. We are very committed to it.", "We are investing over $4 billion into the wireline company, a year. So, that shows our commitment from a capital investment perspective. We've already passed 20 million homes when we committed to originally 18 million. So, we are very committed to the FiOS product. It goes hand in hand with our wireless strategy. And I think if you've asked anybody like you know tease, if you are going to come in and compete for Fiber Into The Home, you certainly would either pick the East coast or the West coast, and they've started with Cablevision in East coast.", "So, we have a very viable footprint and we are committed to that. Now, again, as I've always said, \"you never say never\" and of course Lowell and I are always open to new options and we always keep our eyes open for that. But at this point we are very committed to the wireline business.", "Craig Moffett", "Thank you, Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "Brad, we have time for one more question. If you can please see that up.", "Operator", "Certainly. Your last question comes from Jonathan Atkin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Atkin", "Thanks. So, my question is on enterprise. And I just wondered if you're seeing any notable changes in competitive behavior versus other carriers. And then just on wireless, on the network side, if you could just remind us the approximate timeline for AWS-3 deployment. And then when would the network be ready for LTE-only phones to be sold at retail? Thanks.", "Fran Shammo", "Okay, great. Hi. So, Jonathan, on the enterprise piece, I guess what I would say is we are seeing more or less the same, there has really been no change. I think there is a lot of competition. There is a lot of price compression continuing in the IP space, as we said before the strategic side around security and data centers. But even within the data center space, now there is an awful lot of competition happening with price compression.", "So, I think what you are seeing is the trend that we think will continue as we revamp the portfolio if you will and come into more of whether we're going to willing to compete. So, I think you are just going to see more of the same here.", "As far as the wireless network and deployment of AWS, you were looking at probably in the 17, 18, timeframe. With that, similar to where LTE, you would be for starting in 16 and then of course, so that will continue to deploy there. And then on the phone-only where we would only get a LTE only handset probably more to the end of 2016 as where we're looking to deploy in LTE-only handset.", "Jonathan Atkin", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you. Okay, Brad. That takes us to the end of the questions, but I would like to turn the call back on to Fran to close.", "Fran Shammo", "All right. Thanks, Mike. I just like to close with a few key points. So, through the first nine months, we have solidly executed on our fundamentals, delivering quality customer growth and strong financial results while positioning the business for the future and returning value to shareholders. This execution has generated strong cash flows, enabling us to consistently invest in our networks, platforms, future growth, and innovation. In addition, we have returned value to shareholders and maintained a strong balance sheet, keeping us on track with our leveraging plans.", "As I highlighted earlier, we have returned more than $11 billion to-date through dividends, and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. In September, our Board of Directors again re-innervated their confidence with a 2.7% dividend increase; making this the ninth consecutive year of a dividend increase.", "We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum in the fourth quarter, as we execute our strategy, launch new products and services like go90, positioning ourselves for future growth and creating value for customers and shareholders. Thank you, again, for joining Verizon today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

If at any point your question has been answered, you may remove yourself by pressing star, Q. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. ", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks Carlos. Good morning and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly and the presentation slides are available on the investor relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. ", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran goes through our results, I\u2019d like to highlight a few items. For the fourth quarter of 2015, we reported earnings of $1.32 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few non-operational items that I\u2019d like to highlight. ", "Our year-end mark-to-market adjustment of pension and OPEB liabilities included a pre-tax $3.2 billion credit which decreased our pension and OPEB liability. This adjustment, which was primarily non-cash, was caused by an increase in the discount rate, the adoption of new mortality assumption tables, and the execution of a new prescription drug contract during 2015. We also incurred pre-tax expenses of $613 million primarily related to severance costs under our existing separation plans. On an after-tax basis, these two items amounted to a net $1.6 billion or $0.40 per share.", "Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $254 million on a spectrum license transaction. On an after-tax basis, this gain amounted to $158 million or $0.04 per share. Excluding the effect of these non-operational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.89 in the fourth quarter compared with $0.71 a year ago, or a growth of 25.4%. For the full year, adjusted earnings per share was $3.99 compared with $3.35 in 2014, an increase of 19.1%. On a non-GAAP illustrative basis if we assumed 100% wireless ownership for all of 2014, the adjusted earnings per share growth rate was 16.7% year-over-year.", "As a reminder, included in our wire line results are the operations from the three states that we agreed to sell to Frontier, which we expect to close at the end of the first quarter of 2016. We recognized a benefit of $0.13 per share for the full year due to these assets being classified as held for sale. Additionally, the operations of AOL have been included in our consolidated results since third quarter of 2015. Prior period results do not include AOL.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and happy new year.", "Entering 2016, we are confident in our three-tier strategy of leading at the network connectivity level in the markets we serve, developing new business models through global platforms in video and Internet of Things, and creating certain opportunities and applications and content for incremental monetization. Our execution model enables us to compete effectively in every market condition and build our capabilities for future growth and profitability as an innovator in the digital-first mobile world in 2016 and beyond.", "As we reflect back on 2015, we demonstrated a balanced performance in a dynamic competitive environment. We delivered quality growth and strong financial performance in our operating segments while improving our strategic position and returning value to our shareholders. Overall, our full-year adjusted earnings per share grew 19.1% and free cash flow increased to $18.8 billion, excluding tower proceeds, which enabled us to invest and return value to our shareholders.", "Fundamental execution on our strategies is the priority within our segments. In wireless, we posted another quarter of quality connections growth and profitability with sequential improvements in postpaid growth and net adds, as well as net phone additions. Postpaid net adds totaled 1.5 million for the quarter and 4.5 million for the year, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things connections. Net phone additions were 449,000 for the quarter and 1.1 million for the year. Customer retention was also a highlight with postpaid churn of 0.96%, down 18 basis points for the quarter. For the year, churn was also 0.96%, which improved 8 basis points from prior year. Total wireless revenue grew 4.6% for the year and our EBITDA margin expanded.", "Our wire line quarterly results were highlighted by Fios revenue and customer growth. Additional enterprise and wholesale revenue slightly improved sequentially while we reduced costs. Overall, our full year wire line segment EBITDA margin of 23.5% was up 30 basis points.", "We remain committed to consistently investing in our networks for the future. Our 2015 investments have positioned us for growth and allow us to maintain our network leadership position, as consistently acknowledged by third parties. Wireless densification enables us to add capacity to manage the growing trends of video consumption and the demand required for the Internet of Things, as well as prepositioning us for the future 5G technology. We invested in AWS-3 spectrum during the year, acquiring spectrum covering 480 markets for a total value of $10.4 billion. ", "We continued to execute a disciplined capital allocation model with the priority to invest for the future. We are committed to returning value to shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet. During 2015, we announced the divestiture of certain wire line properties to Frontier and intend to use the proceeds to pay down debt. We monetized the majority of our remaining cell towers and we were able to return value to shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase of $5 billion. We have returned more than $13.5 billion to shareholders during the year, including dividends.", "As we disclosed in September, our board of directors approved a 2.7% dividend increase which raises our annualized dividend to $2.26 per share. This was the ninth consecutive year that our board approved a dividend increase, affirming their confidence in the strength of our future cash flows. ", "We remain committed to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile in the 2018 to 2019 time frame, so overall, a strong, balanced 2015 which provides operating momentum and lays the foundation for the future.", "Now let\u2019s get into fourth quarter and full-year performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5.", "Total operating revenue in the fourth quarter was $34.3 billion, an increase of 3.2% including revenues from AOL. We are pleased with AOL\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter, which does have some seasonality from advertisers. For the full year, we added $4.5 billion to our top line, representing growth of 3.6%. Excluding AOL, which was not part of Verizon a year ago, our top line growth was 0.5% for the fourth quarter. Excluding both AOL and prior period revenues from the public sector business we sold in 2014, the comparable full-year revenue growth rate was 2.6%. This was below our revenue guidance due to lower wireless phone activations, primarily upgrades, and a less than projected take rate on our device installment payment program in the fourth quarter. ", "Historically, our consolidated revenues have been primarily driven by growth in both customers and consumption in wireless and Fios. The change in the wireless commercial model from an equipment subsidy model to a device installment payment model increases the revenue sensitivity to wireless equipment volumes. We continued to manage through the transition to the device installment model.", "We remain committed to our Verizon Lean Six Sigma processes on improving the customer experience while increasing our overall operating and capital efficiencies. The focus on increasing efficiencies has enabled us to sustain a strong earnings profile as we manage through the revenue transformation in the wireless and wire line segments.", "Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $46.6 billion in 2015, an increase of 7.7%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year was 35.4%, which expanded 130 basis points from 2014. ", "Let\u2019s turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. In 2015, cash flows from operations totaled $38.9 billion. This total included just under $2.4 billion of proceeds related to tower monetization transaction, which is non-recurring. Free cash flow for the year excluding the tower proceeds totaled $18.8 billion. ", "We have been successful in selling selected device installment receivables in the private securitization market to finance the device payment program and manage working capital. In the fourth quarter, we continued to sell device installment receivables and received about $2.7 billion in cash proceeds. For the full year 2015, we sold a total of $9.4 billion of device installment receivables resulting in total net cash proceeds of $5.9 billion at year-end. We expect to continue to sell these receivables in 2016. Given the success of the device payment program, high credit quality of our customer base and retention history, we are exploring further diversification of funding sources.", "Our capital spending was consistent with our guidance of around $17.5 billion to $18 billion for the year. In total, capital expenditures were $5.2 billion in the fourth quarter and $17.8 billion for the full year, up 3.4% from 2014. Our balance sheet is strong and enables the financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the year with $110.2 billion of gross debt, net debt of $105.7 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times.", "Now let\u2019s move into a review of the segments, starting with wireless on Slide 7. In the wireless business, revenue growth, profitability and cash flows are driven by our high quality retail postpaid customer base. Total wireless operating revenues grew 1.2% in the quarter to $23.7 billion. For the full year, operating revenues total $91.7 billion, representing growth of 4.6%. Service revenue of $17.2 billion declined 5.6% for the quarter and declined 3.1% for the full year. Equipment revenue increased to $5.4 billion, up 28% for the fourth quarter, and grew 54.4% for the full year. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 1.4% in the fourth quarter and 2% for the full year. We expect that service revenue growth will continue to be pressured as more of the customer base moves to unsubsidized service pricing, and that equipment revenues will grow as the activation rate for device payment plans increases. ", "The percentage of phone activations on installment plans increased to 67% in the fourth quarter compared with about 58% in the third quarter and about 25% in the fourth quarter of last year. The fourth quarter take rate accelerated but was below our expectation of 70%, which contributed to equipment revenue growth that was lower than expected. We expect the first quarter take rate for device installment to be above 70%. ", "During the quarter, 7.6 million phones were activated on device installment payment plans. We have about 25 million device installment phone connections in total, representing approximately 29% of our postpaid phone base. Overall, more than 40% of our postpaid phone customers are on an unsubsidized service pricing.", "In terms of profitability, we generated $9.1 billion of EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 18.9%, and approximately $39 billion for the full year, an increase of 10.6%. Our EBITDA service margin increased to 52.9%, up from 42% for the fourth quarter. The more meaningful measurement is EBITDA as a percentage of total wireless revenue, which expanded to 38.4%, up from 32.6% in the prior year. For the full year, the EBITDA service margin increased to 55.3%, up from 48.5%, and our EBITDA margin on total wireless revenue was 42.5%, up from 40.2% in 2014. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 8 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. We ended the year with 112.1 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale or Internet of Things connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 4.4% to 106.5 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.6 million. Postpaid gross additions improved sequentially to 4.6 million for the fourth quarter and to 16.4 million for the full year. Our disciplined focus on customer retention resulted in improved postpaid churn of 0.96% in the quarter compared with 1.14% a year ago, an improvement of 18 basis points. We are very focused on improving the customer experience, starting with the network, simplified pricing, and better execution in our distribution channels. We are seeing lower customer service call-in rates, which is an indication of improved customer satisfaction. ", "Our retail postpaid net additions of 1.5 million were high quality, with the sequential improvement in the number of 4G smartphone and total phone net adds. We added 906,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter which were partially offset by a net decline in 3G smartphones, resulting in 713,000 net new smartphones. Total postpaid phone net adds totaled 449,000, which included a net decline of basic phones. Tablet net adds totaled 960,000. Net prepaid devices declined by 157,000. Full-year net adds of 4.5 million included 3.3 million 4G smartphones and 3.5 million 4G tablets. The offset to these additions were net declines in basic phones, 3G smartphones, and non-tablet internet devices.", "Let\u2019s now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations totaled 13.4 million in the quarter and 46.6 million for the full year. Similar to prior quarters, about 84% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activations. We ended the year with 73 million smartphones in total, and our smartphone penetration increased to 84% of total phones. 4G devices now comprise more than 79% of our retail postpaid connections base. Growth in 4G device adoption is driving increased data and video usage. Approximately 90% of our total data traffic is on the LTE network, and overall traffic on LTE has increased by approximately 60% over the prior year. About 8.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the fourth quarter, which is up sequentially but down from just under 10% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Wireless capital spending totaled $3.3 billion in the quarter and $11.7 billion for the full year, up 11.5% from a year ago.", "We continued to invest in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of new technologies. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum, and further successfully densifying urban markets. National studies recognize Verizon as the overall 4G LTE network performance leader, leading in categories of overall performance, network reliability, network speed, data performance and call performance. These are the performance metrics that matter to the customer.", "Improving the cost structure of our wireless segment is a priority. In the fourth quarter, we restructured our wireless organization to improve our ability to address the changing needs of our customers faster and more efficiently. We will continue work on our operating model on an ongoing basis and are confident that we can improve efficiencies, as we have done in the past.", "Let\u2019s move next to our wire line segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. In the consumer business, Fios remains the driver of revenue growth and now represents 80.4% of consumer revenue. In the fourth quarter, consumer revenue grew 2.6% and for the full year grew 3.5%. Mass markets revenue grew 1.5% in the fourth quarter and 2.4% for the full year. Small business, which is included in mass markets, experienced declines of 5.6% in the quarter and 4.6% for the full year. ", "The change in the consumer revenue growth trajectory continues as customers right-size their existing bundles and core voice services decline. The demand for Fios broadband only is also increasing, while we are continuing to see a decline in linear video demand. Customers value having a choice in selecting linear video packages. We had another quarter with custom TV representing about one-third of our Fios video sales. ", "In the fourth quarter, Fios total revenue grew 6.8% with consumer Fios revenue growing at 6.6%. This growth was driven primarily by broadband subscriber growth and increased penetration of Quantum. The increasing importance of the internet is evident as customers are requesting higher data speeds. At the end of the quarter, more than 70% of our consumer Fios internet customers subscribe to data speeds of 50 megabits per second or higher, and we have shifted our introductory offers to 50 megabits. We are also seeing an increasing number of customers opting for higher speeds. ", "As I highlighted earlier, Fios internet subscriber growth remains strong in the fourth quarter. In broadband, we added 99,000 net Fios customers for the quarter and 418,000 for the year, and now have a total of 7 million Fios internet subscribers representing 41.8% penetration. Overall, net broadband subscribers increased by 5,000 in the quarter.", "In linear video, we are seeing slowing of market demand. We added 20,000 net customers in the quarter and 178,000 for the year, and now have a total of 5.8 million Fios video subscribers which represents 35.3% penetration. We are working closely with Frontier on the sale of our wire line properties in Florida, Texas and California and expect to close the transaction at the end of the first quarter of 2016.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale, as well as the wire line segment in total. In the Enterprise space, secular and economic challenges remain but we are seeing stabilization on a constant currency basis. In the fourth quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.3%, and on a constant currency basis was down about 2.1%. For the full year, global enterprise revenue declined 5.2% and on a constant currency basis was down about 3.5%. In our global wholesale business, revenues declined 0.2% in the fourth quarter and 3.4% for the full year. While this quarter improved due to seasonal impacts, we remain cautious on the wholesale business and believe that a 4 to 5% decline is more indicative of the underlying trend for the full year 2016.", "Total operating revenues for the entire wire line segment improved to a decline of 0.9% in the quarter and down 1.8% for the full year. The segment EBITDA margin was 24.2% for the quarter and 23.5% for the year, up 30 basis points for the quarter and the year. ", "As we have consistently stated, we are very focused on margins and improving the profitability of the wire line segment. We are committed to reducing our cost structure while maintaining strong customer satisfaction. We have achieved savings from restructuring our network and service provisioning and are seeing improvements in productivity. We continue to reengineer our work processes to improve efficiency and reduce costs, with some of the future savings depending on timing and the outcome of our current labor negotiations.", "As we close on the Frontier sale, we are confident that we will offset the stranded cost at a consolidated level and will report more details post-transaction. ", "Capital spending in wire line was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and totaled $5 billion for the year, down 12.2%, which is consistent with our strategy to reduce our capital spending in the wire line segment.", "Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 for an overview of our three-tier strategy. During 2015, we delivered strong results and further demonstrated our ability to compete effectively in a dynamic competitive environment as we work through the transition of our wireless base from a subsidized equipment model to a device installment payment model, and ramped up new business models to generate incremental revenue growth into the future. Total revenue grew at 2.6% on a comparable basis, and we delivered adjusted EBITDA margin of 35.4% for the year. For 2015, adjusted earnings per share of $3.99 continued to grow at double-digit rates, even if you exclude the depreciation and amortization benefits we realized from the Frontier transaction. Cash flows from operations increased about 19.1% for the year, excluding tower proceeds, and free cash flow totaled $18.8 billion. We delivered more than $13.5 billion of value to our shareholders in the form of an accelerated share repurchase and dividends. ", "As I discussed in my opening, entering 2016 we are confident in our three-tier strategy. We are executing and delivering strong results today through our operating model by growing and serving our customers while driving cost and capital efficiencies. We are focused on building on our network strength and laying the foundation for global platforms and applications and content that appeal to all market demographics, especially the millennials. We refreshed our brand image around the Better Matters campaign to increase awareness of our differentiated strategy around the overall customer experience and to appeal to growing markets. ", "At the network connectivity layer, we are investing in our 4G LTE network to provide the industry\u2019s highest reliability and position ourselves to capture the efficiencies and capabilities of its new features. We are expanding capacity through a number of optimization techniques, effectively managing our spectrum and further successfully densifying urban markets. We opportunistically purchased spectrum during the year to enhance our capacity and position us for the future. As we have done throughout our history, we evaluate spectrum opportunities in a disciplined manner, including the upcoming auction, secondary markets, and future spectrum bands that can be made available.", "Leadership in 5G technology is another strategy to extend our premier network position. We are working with key partners to ensure the aggressive pace of innovation, standards development, and appropriate requirements for next generation of this wireless technology. We will begin pilots in several locations throughout the year.", "Our networks enable us to grow our business through new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things at the connectivity platform and solution layers. We are targeting the millennial opportunity in wireless video beyond connectivity. The acquisition of AOL and Millennial Media during the year added strong capabilities with global ad tech platforms and content to complement our digital formatting and content distribution assets. AOL is scaling its consumer and advertiser base globally and it is positioned very well to take advantage of the strong secular growth trends in mobile and video as we saw in the fourth quarter. We will look to further enhance our media asset capabilities. AOL\u2019s global capabilities and partnerships are instrumental to our overall long-term global digital media strategy, which includes premium content, distribution and advertising platforms across all screens.", "We believe there is a significant opportunity in using the programmatic platform with the data from the wireless customer base to connect consumers and advertisers in a very targeted and scaled way with relevant and engaging ad experiences while protecting individual privacy. The Go90 application that we launched in 2015 is one element of this broader video strategy that will allow us to capture and aggregate audience, deliver mobile-first content, and generate incremental revenue via advertising. As the application, which used our video platform, evolves and gains attention, you can expect new and exciting content, features and functionality like the NBA content we added this past quarter.", "We are encouraged by the use of Go90, not only on the Verizon network but off of the Verizon network as well. During 2016, we expect to share more results around both the Go90 application and our video platform. ", "Earlier this week, we launched FreeBee Data, a new sponsored data service. With FreeBee data, Verizon wireless subscribers can enjoy content on their mobile devices free of data charges, and it helps businesses drive engagement and revenue by providing a powerful platform for sponsoring mobile content. As we have been discussing over the past two quarters, we are offering custom TV for linear customers to provide more video choice. We will look to continue to refresh our Fios TV offerings to take advantage of this secular trend of video bundles with options and more choices to address the increasing over-the-top video trend. ", "We are taking a leadership position in the Internet of Things. With our experience in networks, devices, platforms and applications, we have created an ecosystem that will foster innovation and scale globally above the connectivity layer to enable incremental growth. Our network leadership positions us to capitalize on these new opportunities that require both a ubiquitous mobile experience and the capabilities of platforms above the connectivity layer. ", "We are focused on the telematics and transportation vertical and launched our direct-to-consumer product, Hum, in the third quarter. We also announced our Connected City strategy, beginning with Savannah, and introduced a suite of developer tools, ThingSpace, to accelerate innovative applications to come to market. At the recent Consumer Electronics Show, the pipeline for mobile Internet of Things capabilities was very prominent. New revenue streams from the Internet of Things are growing with revenues of approximately $200 million in the quarter and about $690 million for the full year, a year-over-year increase of 18%.", "Let\u2019s move next to Slide 13 for our 2016 priorities. Our strategy and priorities remain consistent for 2016. We will concentrate on growing our quality customer base in both wireless and Fios and build upon customer loyalty by providing the best overall customer experience. We remain focused on network leadership and developing new ecosystems in video and the Internet of Things by leveraging our ubiquitous network in the United States and scaling our platforms globally. We are also committed to returning value to our shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet in addition to returning to our pre-Vodafone transaction credit rating profile by the 2018-2019 time frame.", "As previously stated, Verizon expects full-year 2016 adjusted earnings to plateau at a level comparable to our strong full-year 2015 adjusted earnings due to the device installment payment model transition, completion of the Frontier transaction, and the ramping of new business models in video and Internet of Things. Additionally, we are targeting the following for 2016: a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with our full-year 2015 performance; consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion - this includes capital spending of approximately $150 million for the properties sold to Frontier, and a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million. In terms of income taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35 to 36%.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Fran, thank you. We also recognize that there might have been some delay in posting our materials to our website. The issue, I think, is resolved, so we appreciate your patience.", "Carlos, if you can open us up now for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]", "Your first question comes from Mr. David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael Stefanski", "Carlos, if David\u2019s not there, then we can just move on and pick David up next.", "Operator", "Thank you, one moment, sir. ", "David Barden", "Can you hear me now?", "Michael Stefanski", "Yes, go ahead, David.", "David Barden", "There you go. Thanks for taking the questions. Fran, just as a housekeeping item with respect to the notion of a, quote-unquote, plateau, could you kind of band that for people? Are you trying to put a plus or minus 1 or 2% around the $3.99? Are you trying to say $3.99 or better for 2016, just so the Street can kind of get a sense as to where the real midpoint there is?", "Second, obviously we had an extension in bonus tax depreciation last year. It\u2019s been something you\u2019ve been benefiting from. Could you kind of scope the size of the benefit you\u2019re going to get this year? And if I could, just one last one. You\u2019ve talked about how cord shaving has been important for the new customers coming into the Fios space. Could you talk about if at all you\u2019re seeing some kind of transition in the existing base to these skinnier bundles? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "All right, thanks David. So on earnings per share, we started this back, I think midyear in 2015 when Lowell and I started to talk about the plateau and the level comparable to 2015 adjusted earnings. The way to think about this is we ended 2015 at $3.99. There is $0.13 of depreciation benefit because of the Frontier assets being held for sale, so that really is a level set of $3.86. When we talk about plateauing, we\u2019re referring to the $3.99, so when you think about this, you\u2019re going from $3.86 from a jump-off point to $3.99, so the way I think about it is we\u2019re actually growing earnings in low single digits from 2015 to 2016 when you make that one-time adjustment, so we will grow through the benefit of the deprecation this year.", "Some of the reasons for that, as I said on the last quarterly call, some of this is just math - moving the wireless transformation from the subsidy model to the device payment model, and of course the ramping of our new businesses which I\u2019ve been very clear in the beginning. These are like start-up businesses, and as with most start-up businesses, you have very large losses in the beginning until you can grow the customer bases and start to generate the profitability.", "Moving into the bonus depreciation, yes, we will get a substantial benefit next year, but I want to be clear that you should not anticipate that our cash tax payments will decrease in \u201916. They will actually increase, even with this benefit, and a piece of that is because the profitability from a pre-tax income perspective will continue to increase. We\u2019re also still eating through the reversal of prior year bonus depreciations, so from a cash tax perspective you should expect our cash tax percentage to continue to increase closer to our effective tax rate. Now, not to the extent of the 35 to 36 guidance that I gave you, but it certainly will move from the low 20% we realized in \u201915 to the upper 20% in \u201916.", "On the cord shaving piece, as we said in our prepared remarks, we are starting to see more and more customers coming into Fios on a broadband-only basis, so just a single play strictly with broadband. As far as our current base goes, we see a little bit of trending but not much. Most customers are depleting the voice side of the product and keeping the broadband and video side of the product at this point.", "David, hopefully that answers your question. Let\u2019s move to the next one.", "David Barden", "Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "Carlos, we\u2019re ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from Simon Flannery from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery", "Thanks very much. Good morning, Fran. You touched briefly on the auction in your commentary. I know in the past, you\u2019ve made some of your interest contingent on some of the rules, which we have now. Maybe you could just think about how we should be thinking about sizing your potential participation, what you need here. There\u2019s been a lot of stories about potential asset sales over the months, most recently about data centers. Perhaps you could just talk about your philosophy now that you\u2019ve done the towers, you\u2019re doing the Frontier assets. Should we expect, or are you considering doing other significant asset sales over the coming year or two? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, thanks Simon. So on the auction, let\u2019s just--I\u2019ll keep this one short on the incentive auction because of a lot of rules around what I can and can\u2019t say at this point. We will participate in the auction, and I\u2019ll leave it at that.", "Thinking about spectrum overall, I think we have to think about the 600 megahertz, which I\u2019ve talked about previously and how that fits to our portfolio. We think ahead to 5G - as we said, we\u2019ll be at the forefront and we are currently at the forefront globally talking about standards. We will be the first company to roll 5G out in the United States, and we\u2019re currently preparing for those field trials. ", "The other thing I would say about 5G is we would hope that the FCC moves quickly to adopt the rules to facilitate 5G deployment. Think about 5G - it may not just be about mobility. It may be about other use cases, not just about mobility. ", "Then when we think about the unlicensed opportunity, if you studied the Consumer Electronics Show this past two weeks, there were multiple manufacturers who were running side-by-side comparisons of unlicensed, if you will, LTE or unlicensed spectrum utilized by an LTE carrier right next to WiFi, and it absolutely showed no interference, which is some of the rhetoric out there. It actually showed that the comparability is it improves the WiFi performance by having a managed unlicensed within the LTE carrier. So again, this just goes to continuing to work with the FCC and having them see through the release and usage of unlicensed for the LTE carriers.", "Then of course, we will continue to utilize the secondary market, as we do quarter in and quarter out, utilizing swaps which we just completed this past quarter. We\u2019re working on another swap that we\u2019ll complete in the first quarter, and also minimal buys in the marketplace with smaller holders. So that\u2019s how we think about the whole spectrum asset perspective.", "On the sale of assets, as Lowell and I have continually stated, we will always look for opportunities. The data centers is an exploratory exercise to see if the asset is more valuable inside or outside the portfolio. I view that asset similar to the way we view towers - is there a way to monetize this asset that contributes value to our shareholders and gives us the capability to move that capital into higher returning assets for Verizon. There is no decision that has been made. This is an exploratory, and as we explore, if the numbers come out like it did on towers, then we\u2019ll execute on a transaction. If it doesn\u2019t, then we won\u2019t. So at this point, again, we will always look at opportunities to monetize the portfolio to the benefit of our shareholders.", "Thank you, Simon.", "Simon Flannery", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Carlos, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of John Hodulik from UBS. Your line is now open, sir.", "John Hodulik", "Thanks. Fran, I think the churn below 1% was obviously a bright spot for the quarter. Is that a level that you think you can maintain as you look out into 2016, given the competitive environment? Then you mentioned some continued pressure on the service revenues looking out. Can you talk a little bit about the components driving that and when you expect to see an inflection in that metric? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Sure, thanks John. So one the churn rate, if you recall when we sat here a year ago and we entered 2015, we said a concentration of \u201915 will be to protect our customer base. That\u2019s exactly what we executed on throughout 2015, and the execution of that will continue in 2016. The focus will be customer satisfaction and satisfying our customer base so they stay with us, and I think that\u2019s proven through our very low churn rate this fourth quarter, even with the rhetoric from some outsiders about how they\u2019re stealing customers. The churn rate does not reflect that, and port outs are down year-over-year. So we are doing what we said we would do around the loyalty. Customer satisfaction comes in here around our simplicity and being simple with customers so they understand what they\u2019re getting, and this goes to our loyalty base.", "On the service revenue side, I guess the thing I would say on this is, again, this is really to math - math of shifting from the subsidy model with higher service revenue to a device payment model, where you get a break in service revenue but you pay full price for the handset model. As we said, we are through 40% of our customers. We\u2019re slightly higher than 40% who are now on that new pricing, so you\u2019ve already seen the impact of that. As I said last call, we believe the inflection point will happen at 50%, which we believe we will attain midyear. Coming out of the fourth quarter, though, we did see a slowdown in the take rate of installment sale, but we do believe that that take rate will accelerate back up above 70% for the fourth quarter, and we\u2019re going to announce some differences here, a shortcoming that will drive some of that behavior towards that.", "As you know, we continue to allow our current base customers who upgrade to select whether they take device payment or subsidy, and what we saw in the fourth quarter was we had a higher percentage of our base stay on the subsidy model, which caused pressure on the P&L of wireless because of the subsidy take. ", "So having said that, John, I think as we go through the year, we\u2019ll be able to give you more clarity here. The other thing I would ask you to take a look at is the [IARPA] metric, which if you look at third quarter, it went up by 0.2% and then the fourth quarter went up 0.9%, so you\u2019re already starting to see some of the underlying metrics starting to absorb some of the repricing. So I\u2019ll leave it at that for \u201916, but I\u2019ll come back to you as we break through the 50%.", "John Hodulik", "Great, thanks Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "Next question, Carlos.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question will be coming from the line of Phil Cusick from JP Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Phil Cusick", "Hey guys, thanks. So Fran, first just following up on John\u2019s question, with the current asset mix, and not just in \u201916 but beyond, is this still a business that can grow well above GDP, and how far do you think above? Second on custom TV, you\u2019ve said in the past that you\u2019re sort of pushing toward your minimums on some of your contracts. How should we think about that potentially impacting custom TV, or do you think you could reopen some of those contracts to let that percent go higher? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, thanks Phil. So the answer to the question is yes, absolutely, and I think we have to go back and start at the beginning on the whole top line growth story. So first and foremost, I think the foundation is our network, our strategy in densification, the use of fiber. Fiber is going to be critical with the densification, dark fiber. Ninety-two percent of our cell sites are already fiber-enabled, the other 8% are microwave, which probably won\u2019t get fiber. So when you look at it, almost 100% of our cell sites are fiber enabled and every small cell, 100% of every small cell we deployed is fiber backed. So this is in preparation of some of the future products and services that we are looking at in conjunction with both what Marnie has under IOT, Go90, but also for 5G.", "If you look at customer satisfaction, this goes to a big component of the low churn and how we start to increase the value to the customer so that they are willing to pay us more for increased value. The quality base also goes to this.", "So when you look at wireless, they grew 1.2% here in the fourth quarter. If you look at volume overall year-over-year, gross adds and upgrades were down 1.9 million, so if you just do the backwards math on that, that\u2019s in excess of a billion dollars of revenue that wasn\u2019t there this year, that was there last year. So when you look at it, the foundation of Verizon wireless is still very strong, and we believe that we can continue to grow the Verizon wireless revenue streams.", "On wire line, Fios is still the foundation. It\u2019s now 80% of the overall wire line revenue. When you look at what we\u2019re doing, broadband, the pervasiveness of broadband, no one can match our symmetry on the up and downloads, so that\u2019s something that we have against our competition. We are preparing for the over-the-top model. Custom TV is one of those things that I\u2019ve said yes, it has a limited life, but you\u2019re going to see us refresh custom TV and continue to what consumers want, which is they want choice. They don\u2019t want to have to pay for bundles that they never use. Then of course, stability of the enterprise business also adds to this. ", "Then you jump into our growth engines. If you look at AOL, AOL this quarter increased $300 million in revenue sequentially from the third quarter. It goes to the strength of the advertising model under AOL, which is why we bought them. Now, some of that is seasonal, but we believe that they will continue to have strong growth into 2016. ", "Go90, which is still in its beginning stages, and I know we\u2019ve seen some external reports on the number of downloads in excess of 2 million, but the key to us is not the downloads. The key is viewership and it\u2019s around content, and we will continue to add content that\u2019s favorable to all generations of population. Obviously we have a lot of content there for millennials, but sports and music attain to a lot more than just millennials, so we\u2019re attacking all viewership with this product and we\u2019ll have more to say about that probably midyear.", "Internet of Things, if you walked around CES, it\u2019s all about the digital mobile world, and we are in best position to capitalize on that with our Smart Cities, telematics, with the launch of Hum - we started that in the fourth quarter and we\u2019ve already seen that there are certain stores in the United States that can\u2019t keep the product within Verizon wireless. They\u2019re continually selling out of the product, and this is a recurring revenue stream. If you think about ThingSpace, this is really the adjunct to the Consumer Electronics Show where we\u2019ve opened up our platform. We now have over 4,200 developers working on that platform, and that\u2019s just since October 29 of this year. ", "So yes, it was a transition year in \u201915. It will be a transition year in \u201916, but I am confident that with the strategies that we are taking, that we will absolutely be a GDP growth company post-2016.", "Custom TV, we talked about that. We will refresh that here in the short term to be in compliance with the contractual arrangements that we need to be in compliance with. Thanks Phil.", "Phil Cusick", "Is there a hearing that needs to happen at some point this year, or a trial?", "Francis Shammo", "Relating to ESPN?", "Phil Cusick", "Yes.", "Francis Shammo", "Look - this will go its course. They're a great partner of ours. We\u2019ll continue to work with them, and I\u2019m not going to speak to the actual lawsuit.", "Phil Cusick", "Thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "Next question Carlos, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike McCormack from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike McCormack", "Hey guys, thanks. Fran, maybe just a quick follow-up on the [IARPA] question. How fast do you think equivalent revenue starts to ramp up here? I guess just thinking about the percentage of those customers making payments versus those that are on non-subsidized plans, is that gap--and there\u2019s probably some retention built into that, but I assume that gap can close over time? Just your thoughts around that, and then just a quick other question regarding towers. We\u2019ve heard a couple of your competitors sort of downplaying future tower needs and trying to bypass some of that cost. Just trying to get a sense for what you think as far as your needs for towers goes.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, thanks. So in the [IARPA], keep in mind only 29% of our customers currently today are on a device payment plan, so they\u2019re actually taking the installment plan and paying us full price for the equipment, but 40% of our customers who fulfilled their subsidy contract have moved over to that pricing, so they are getting the discount, so we\u2019re absorbing that. As I\u2019ve said, once you get to that 50%, you should see that inflection point start to occur, and you\u2019re already starting to see some of that in the [IARPA] type metric.", "So it\u2019s hard for me to forecast exactly what will happen here, but the forecast that I have is at 50%, you start to see an inflection point, and we\u2019ll talk more about that as we go through the quarters. ", "As far as towers go, look - I mean, we continue to build macro towers but at a much slower rate than historically. Our focus is really around small cells, densified antenna systems in-building, but keep in mind that each of those small cells in-building and antenna systems all give fiber back to a main macro cell, so the macro cells still have an important role in how you deliver traffic into those small cells. So as far as building and creating new towers, that\u2019s at a much slower rate but the importance of the tower is still there.", "Mike McCormack", "Great, thanks Fran.", "Francis Shammo", "Sure.", "Michael Stefanski", "Carlos, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Brett Feldman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking the question. Fran, you had noted had churn in upgrades, they were all lower year-on-year. It seems that across the sector, activity levels have been lighter than we might have thought, whether it\u2019s churn or gross adds or upgrades. Why do you think that is? Do you think that this is a temporary factor or do you think it\u2019s the new normal? Really, I guess the question is what do you think is going to happen in 2016?", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, thanks Brett. So look - 2014 was a unique year. You have a very different form factor come out from Apple, which drove a lot of traffic to that iconic device. You continue to have innovation from Samsung and LG, but we didn\u2019t have that huge change in the handset this year that we saw a year ago, so that, I think, affected some of the upgrade model. But you know, when you look at it, we still did about 1.5 million more upgrades in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter, so the volume of upgrades still increased, it just wasn\u2019t what it was a year ago. If you remember, I said coming into this way back in the second quarter, I said I did not anticipate that the fourth quarter this year would be in similar volume to the fourth quarter of last year, but if you go back to the previous years, I think you\u2019ll see similar lower volume years and then you\u2019ll have iconic devices come out, and it stimulates some usage case there.", "So for \u201916, it\u2019s too early to tell yet, but I would think that we\u2019ll see similar trends that we did in \u201915.", "Brett Feldman", "Are you seeing any evidence that as customers move to installment plans, they actually keep their devices longer?", "Francis Shammo", "Well, for our base it\u2019s too early to tell because the first generation of them are just starting to mature. Until I get some real factual data on that, it\u2019s hard for me to answer. My own personal opinion here is that if you look at history, a third of your customer base upgrades every year. I don\u2019t see that changing, regardless of what plan the customer is on.", "Brett Feldman", "Great. Thanks for taking the question.", "Michael Stefanski", "Carlos, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Mike Rollins from Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Rollins", "Hi, thanks for the opportunity. Just two questions, if I could. First Fran, if you could just talk about what Verizon was able to accomplish on cost-cutting in 2015, and how investors should think about that relative size in 2016. Second, as you look across your different business segments, are you seeing any changes in the macroeconomic backdrop or a risk of a recession? Thanks.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, thanks Mike. So on the cost cutting, look - I think the last three to four years, we\u2019ve talked about this and we\u2019re an extremely disciplined corporation as far as costs go. With the launch of our Verizon Lean Six Sigma program three years ago, that continues to maintain momentum. We took out almost 30 million calls down from a year ago, so there\u2019s a lot of progress being made on self-serve. There\u2019s a lot of progress being made within our logistics system - I mean, this year alone we generated working capital benefits from how we handle our phone inventory. So you saw the wireless restructure this year, was the first restructure we had really since the inception of Verizon wireless. ", "So as we go into \u201916, you saw us take that severance charge, and I would tell you most of that severance charge was related to headcount that is already completed in the fourth quarter, so entering into 2016 we continue on the path that we were on. We will continue to look at customer satisfaction, more self-serve options that reduce the amount of calls that we have to take from customers. So there is still a lot of work to be done around our cost structure, and if you look at wire line, as we came into this year, Lowell and I said we would improve the profitability of wire line. That came from all the cost reductions that John and his team achieved. So we will continue on that path, and I feel good about that.", "As far as overall economics, I\u2019m not really seeing much of anything in the consumer spaces that we drive. I look at what everybody else looks at, and we\u2019ll have to wait to see what 2016 comes out, but I\u2019m certainly not going to predict any negativism there.", "Mike Rollins", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Carlos, next question. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question will be coming from Craig Moffett from MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.", "Craig Moffett", "Hi, good morning guys. Two questions, if I might. First, on Go90, can you update us a little bit on what the early results are and what learnings you\u2019ve had from Go90? Just given your comments about the roughly flat year-over-year EPS and the impact that Go90 might have on that, I think a lot of us have concluded that there\u2019s likely to be something significantly bigger coming this year with respect to marketing and content. Can you at least give us a timeline for when we might see those kinds of developments on Go90?", "Francis Shammo", "Sure, thanks Craig. So when I think about the whole portfolio - Go90, Verizon digital media services and AOL, obviously we just launched all these products, so there\u2019s a start-up. It was the first fourth quarter that we advertised these types of launches. You\u2019re going to see that continue through the four quarters of \u201916, which was not there in \u201915, so there will be pressure from these start-up companies. ", "Our learnings on Go90 are very simple - we\u2019re looking at how many times individuals revisit the platform in one day, and we\u2019re starting to see some positives there where people will come in multiple times during the day, and that\u2019s important because that\u2019s what\u2019s viable to the advertising community.", "So the whole basis here is we have to ramp viewership. I will tell you, internally we have surpassed what we thought we would have at this point in time. We have set higher targets for \u201916 because we need to build the viewership in a much quicker fashion. I think what you\u2019re seeing here from AOL is a very strong fourth quarter. Now, there is seasonality to that, but as I mentioned, I\u2019m looking for them to grow substantially in 2016. ", "So I think when you put this together, I think the top line will start to reflect some of the things that we\u2019re looking for, but it will create bottom line pressure. These will not, especially Go90 will not be profitable product probably within a one to two-year horizon right now. When we launched it, we said two to three, but it\u2019s probably two years before that will become a profit contributor to the enterprise, but it will certainly build on the top line perspective. Right now, we\u2019re focused on viewership, not necessarily the profitability of the product.", "So I\u2019ll stop there. As I said, we will come in with much more detail probably midyear and start to give you some viewership into exactly some of the results of Go90 and AOL.", "Craig Moffett", "And Fran, related to that question, if I could, on AOL, now that you\u2019ve had AOL for a while, there was some talk - and I think you directly spoke to the possibility of a Yahoo! or something like that, are there other assets that now that you\u2019ve had AOL for a while, you think make sense to expand that part of your business with?", "Francis Shammo", "Well, look - I think we\u2019ve been pretty open since we acquired AOL. We said that we would continue to add to that portfolio. We acquired Millennial, which we talked about. So yes, there are things that we continue to look at for fill-ins, if you will. The other one that you brought up, it\u2019s intriguing but there\u2019s really nothing to respond to at this point on that. So, look - we will continue to look at all of our options, as Lowell and I said. We will continue to look at opportunities externally and look at opportunities internally, and if they make sense for the shareholder, then we\u2019ll execute on those opportunities.", "Craig Moffett", "Okay, thanks Fran.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay Carlos, time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your last question will be coming from Amir Rozwadowski from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you very much. Fran, you had mentioned that you continue to look to monetize your handset receivables. I think in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that you were looking at other alternatives. Perhaps you might be able to elaborate. We\u2019ve obviously seen your competitors look to other means and funding strategies to support their businesses, so any thoughts on the potential options you are considering would be most appreciated.", "Francis Shammo", "Sure, thank you, Amir. So just to refresh, we monetized or securitized $9.4 billion of receivables. We received gross cash of $7.2 billion. We obviously paid off some of those securitizations, so about a $5.9 billion net cash. So when you think about that, we absorbed about $3.5 billion within our working capital this year from the switch to the device payment model.", "I will tell you that we have been talking to the rating agencies about different types of financing, and I will probably leave it at that at this point. But we will be looking at potential public markets as well as private markets, but we will stay with the securitization model as well. So we\u2019re just looking at very different alternatives to support the program going forward, because we do believe it will continue to grow in 2016. More to say on that when we come to a conclusion on that one, Amir.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "And then if I may, just one follow-up. You folks seem to be taking the lead with discussing a number of new bandwidth enhancing technologies, and you had alluded to this sort of on your prepared remarks around 5G developments and unlicensed spectrum. How should we think about your ability to bolster the carrier\u2019s capacity moving forward utilizing these types of developments, and ultimately do you believe there is a path to improving your capacity without actually having to broadly expand your spectrum portfolio at this point?", "Francis Shammo", "The answer to the question is yes. If you look at some of the small cell technology and also some of the technology that can be utilized at the cell site, I know there\u2019s a fancy name for it but I\u2019m not the engineer here, but it gives you the capability to be able to tilt antennas and turn antennas to where the capacity is. So if you think about football game Sundays and college games, we have the capability to utilize our current resources to increase capacity without any spectrum capacity. So there is a number of technologies that are coming. Obviously when we launched 4G, we said it would be five times more efficient than 3G. 5G is too early, but my suspicion is that we\u2019re going to see some similar benefits there from a capacity standpoint, which is one of the benefits of 5G. ", "So yes, I think that if you look at spectrum, we are in a very, very good spectrum holding, as we said, with all my other comments around spectrum and how we utilize unlicensed along with what we bought in AWS and the repositioning of what we currently have on 3G over to 4G. So utilizing all of these items, we feel that we are in very, very good shape from a capacity standpoint.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you very much for the incremental color.", "Michael Stefanski", "Okay, thank you for your questions. Before we end the call, I\u2019ll just turn it back to Fran for a few remarks.", "Francis Shammo", "Okay, thanks Mike. So look - 2015 was a year of significant change at Verizon, and even with all that change, we delivered a strong financial year, continued to invest in growing our customer base, invested in our networks, developed and expanded new businesses, and returned value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase. 2016 will continue what we started in 2015. We will focus on execution and growth with our three-tier strategy and heritage. We will continue to build on a strong network and customer foundation. With our foundation, we will compete effectively in this dynamic marketplace. We will bring new products and services to market and continue to be the leader in the digital first mobile world.", "We look forward to maintaining our positive momentum to create value for our customers and our shareholders, and I\u2019d like to thank you for joining Verizon today. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon Conference Services.

(Broker)", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tori. Good morning, and welcome to our Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam; and our Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo.", "Thank you for joining us this morning. Given yesterday's announcement of the Yahoo acquisition, we expect this call will exceed an hour. As a reminder our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.", "The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Lowell and Fran go through our strategy and these results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $0.17 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results included several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight.", "Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $3.6 billion, generated by pension and other post-retirement benefits, primarily due to the re-measurements triggered by the new labor contracts, the transaction with Frontier, and settlement accounting. The overall impact after tax amounted $2.2 billion or $0.54 per share.", "On the balance sheet side in the quarter, employees benefit obligations were reduced on a net basis by $1.6 billion, primarily driven by actuarial evaluations associated with the new labor contracts and the Frontier transaction, which were partially offset by the mark-to-market remeasurements and the assets transferred to Frontier. Year to date unfunded employee benefit obligations have been reduced by $1.9 billion.", "We incurred nonoperational expenses of $1.8 billion in connection with the early debt redemption and tender offers. On an after-tax basis these charges amounted to $1.1 billion or $0.27 per share. Additionally, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $1 billion on the sale of California, Florida, and Texas Wireline markets to Frontier. On an after-tax basis the gain on sale amounted to $139 million or $0.03 per share.", "Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.94 in the second quarter, compared with $1.04 per share a year ago, or a decline of 9.6%. There were no special items of a nonoperational nature in the second quarter of 2015.", "Our adjusted results include the impact of the work stoppage, which at the consolidated level amounted to $420 million on a pre-tax basis, representing about $0.07 per share.", "At the Wireline segment level, before consolidating intercompany transactions, the pre-tax amount was $489 million. As previously stated, we will not recapture the $0.07 for the impact of the work stoppage on full year 2016 earnings per share.", "For purposes of comparability in the Wireline segment, the historical results of the operations that we sold to Frontier on April 1, 2016, have been reclassified to Corporate and Other. On June 28 we filed a Form 8-K, providing the recast on audited historical information for the past nine quarters, which can be accessed on our website. Additionally, prior-period results do not include the operations of AOL.", "With that I'd now like to turn the call over to Lowell.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We had an eventful first half of 2016, marked with several strategic milestones. We continued to evolve our Wireless pricing model and customer interface. We closed the Frontier transaction. We made major moves in our network and reached new contracts with our labor unions, all while delivering solid results in a challenging environment. We will discuss all of these in more detail in a few minutes.", "In addition, yesterday we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Yahoo's operating business for approximately $4.8 billion, a transaction that will make us an even stronger competitor in digital media.", "With everything that's going on I wanted to take a few minutes at the start of this call to put these initiatives in context and tell you how we are strengthening our ability to realize our mission of delivering the promise of the digital world.", "We have spoken to you before about our three-tier strategy. First, sustaining quality and performance leadership in all of our networks; second, in building new ecosystems around our broadband, video, and Internet of Things global platforms; and finally, monetizing our investments in networks and platform through applications and content. I'm very pleased with the progress that we are making across all of these fronts.", "For us, delivering the promise of the digital world begins with network leadership, which has been the cornerstone of our brand since we formed Verizon in 2000. Our 4G LTE network consistently leads all external studies for quality and reliability across the country, even with the explosive growth of data usage.", "Over the last 16 years we have grown from approximately 25 million customers using Wireless almost exclusively for voice services to more than 110 million customers using Wireless for mostly data services. In the second quarter alone network usage increased 44% over the prior year. To give you a perspective on traffic growth, we carry the same amount of traffic on our network in 1 hour today as we did in \u2013 10 plus years ago in 1 week.", "In light of this growing demand we are continuing to invest in and evolve our Wireless network to provide the broadest, most reliable, and highest quality Wireless experience for our customers. This investment includes expanding the fiber front and backhaul to support Wireless network growth.", "Verizon has been a leader in pushing the industry forward in every new generation of Wireless technology. With 3G we ushered in the era of Wireless data. By being the first to implement 4G LTE we changed the game for the delivery of Wireless broadband, opening up new opportunities for our customers and the industry as a whole. LTE is a growth engine for applications and devices across the ecosystem, increasing the productivity of our country. New players are entering this ecosystem every day.", "To make sure 4G LTE can handle our customers' ever increasing demands, we are challenging conventional approaches to network architecture by deploying fiber to cell sites and densifying cells to handle the constant demand on the network in high usage areas.", "We are also optimizing 4G with new techniques, like centralized baseband architecture, carrier aggregation, and core network virtualization initiatives, which provide operating, capital, and spectral network efficiencies. The balance has shifted away from building capacity exclusively through spectrum. We believe that 4G will be the base layer of our Wireless network for years to come.", "Moreover, our approach to network architecture is also preparing us for 5G and shaping our thinking about future investment that will drive growth across all our business and ecosystem. You saw the first fruits of this strategy in April, when we announced our One Fiber strategy for the city of Boston. We will create a single fiber optic network platform capable of supporting Wireless and Wireline technologies and multiple products.", "In particular, we believe the fiber deployment will create economic growth for Boston. And we are talking to other cities about similar partnerships. No longer are discussions solely about local franchise rights, but how to make forward-looking cities more productive and effective.", "Our announced agreement to acquire XO Communications will also be a key part of this strategy, providing us with the deep fiber assets, including 40 metro fiber rings in major cities and millimeter wave spectrum in a significant part of the country that will give us a critical competitive edge.", "Yesterday the SEC approved our lease arrangement with XO, so that we have a clear spectrum path toward 5G deployment, which like 4G, will be a game changer. I think of 5G initially as, in effect, Wireless fiber, which is Wireless technology that can provide an enhanced broadband experience that could only previously be delivered with physical fiber to the customer. With Wireless fiber the so called last mile can be a virtual connection, dramatically changing our cost structure.", "I know we heard a lot of skepticism when we formed the 5G Tech Forum last fall, with critics questioning the need for moving so soon. But as we learned from our experience with 4G, being a first mover in developing the technology and nurturing the ecosystem is the best way to ensure that our customers benefit from its capabilities.", "In our labs we're able to predict and model what a future home will look like, with multiple high definition TVs, laptops, tablets, and virtual reality applications served over a Wireless connection, delivered at speeds significantly higher than 1 gigabit per second. We are conducting field trials to see how the technology will perform using millimeter wave spectrum in terms of reach and propagation in real world conditions.", "Mobile use cases, which will follow toward the end of the decade, will include massive Internet of Things scale and low latency services and applications. Trade associations are already accelerating their timelines for standards, which will be good for the industry. The ecosystem, including chipset, equipment, and device manufacturers, is aggressively adding resources to deliver handsets and low latency applications.", "To date we have accomplished several key milestones in moving toward 5G. Along with our Tech Forum partners we completed radio specifications, which means that we can now test technical components for Wireless fiber services. We have ongoing technical trials in several markets to accelerate the pace of innovation. And we're strengthening our partnerships with carriers and OEMs to foster the development of a global ecosystem.", "So we see the stars aligning very quickly when it comes to the 5G future. We have been very pleased by the partnership with the FCC to finalize the 5G spectrum rules. All of this keeps us on track to be the first carrier to deploy a 5G network in the United States, preparing us for a fixed commercial Wireless fiber launch in 2017 and laying the foundation to build mobility use cases later in the decade.", "Through every generation of technology our fundamental principles remain the same: highest quality, consistent investment, customer value, and yes, superior execution. This dedication to network quality has created the best Wireless network in the world. Maintaining and extending that leadership remains the number one priority of the company.", "With the other two tiers of our three-part strategy, we're developing the platforms, content, and applications that will drive usage on our network and monetize our investment in this world-class infrastructure. Let me review our progress in these areas, starting with video.", "As you know, we've been building our video assets and capabilities for some time with a goal of building a global platform and developing new business models for reaching the digital video customer.", "At the heart of this video evolution are the changing ways in which younger consumers access their digital and mobile content. Over the past several years we have dramatically expanded the ways in which we can deliver content wherever and however the digital customer wants it, including: large and small bundles of linear content through Fios TV; new and better customer experiences for Fios using IP-based technology; over-the-top delivery of content; purchasing of AOL with its publishing and advertising technology and content; further enhancing AOL with the Millennial Media acquisition; introducing go90 and its vast library of digital content, not only for our Verizon customers, but other carriers' customers as well; developing a global video distribution platform for media companies to efficiently deliver high quality digital content; and finally, establishing a content joint venture with Hearst, through which we have invested in two leading digital brands for female and male millennials, namely AwesomenessTV and Complex Media.", "We assembled a great team and strong assets under Marni Walden. Just over the past year since the AOL acquisition we have learned a tremendous amount about the video market and opportunities to grow in the future. Her team is focused on integrating these assets and driving profitable growth by attracting viewers through great content, which in turn attracts advertisers by increasing the return on their advertising dollar.", "That brings us to Yahoo. We see tremendous opportunity in the digital video marketplace, which has an estimated addressable market of $180 billion by 2020. Today, that marketplace is dominated by two brands. Content creators and advertisers are hungry for alternatives as the market expands for both in-home and mobile consumption. Verizon intends to be a significant player in this space.", "By acquiring Yahoo's operating business, we are scaling up to be a major competitor in mobile media. Yahoo's operations provide a valuable portfolio of online properties and mobile applications which attract over 1 billion monthly active consumer views. It also brings market-leading content, brands, and sports, finance, news, and e-mail into the portfolio. It expands our analytics and ad tech capabilities and enhances our competitive position and value proposition to advertisers.", "We are already seeing enthusiasm from partners in sports, news, and finance to leverage this scale in the future.", "Yahoo's operations complement AOL's business as well as our overall asset portfolio. The global scale, volume of customer analytics, and market reach of the combined assets will allow us to create long-term value in a less capital intensive manner.", "We look forward to working with the very talented team at Yahoo. In the months ahead we will be focused on completing the necessary regulatory process, planning for integration, and closing this cash transaction early next year. Going forward, this acquisition will put us in a great position as a top global media company and give us a significant source of revenue growth for the future.", "We are also building our growth capabilities in the emerging Internet of Things market by developing business models to monetize usage on our network at the connectivity and platform layers. We had another quarter of 25% growth in revenue from the Internet of Things, which amounted to approximately $205 million in the quarter and about $400 million year to date in 2016. We've also seen strong demand for our telematics products, including our direct-to-consumer product, hum, and see many opportunities to expand in the market.", "In June we agreed to acquire Telogis, which will advance our fleet telematics connected solutions and expand our distribution relationships while we grow our global scale.", "So as we are making tremendous strides strategically, John Stratton and his operations team are not taking their eye off the ball when it comes to operational performance.", "I am pleased with where we stand as we reach the midpoint of the year.", "In Wireless we've made significant progress in shifting away from the subsidy model, with 53% of our postpaid phone base now on unsubsidized price plans. At the same time, our churn metrics continue to be the best in the industry, which is a testimony to our high quality loyal customer base. Fran is going to cover more of that in a few minutes.", "In Wireline we completed the sale of three properties to Frontier, which concentrates our Wireline assets in the Northeast corridor where we can further invest in fiber.", "We also managed through a 7-week work stoppage, ultimately reaching an outcome that benefited our employees and our business. While the strike impacted the results in the second quarter, the new labor contracts will generate approximately $500 million of cash savings over the term of the contract. The contract benefits include workforce flexibility provisions that provide the opportunity to optimize processes and scale customer service centers to better align with the business needs.", "Also, noncash benefit savings primarily related to retiree healthcare will be realized. We preserved the bargained-for caps on our annual obligation for post-retirement medical benefits, which when netted with other postretirement benefit changes reduced our unfunded employee benefit obligation by $4.7 billion in the quarter.", "I'd like to thank our management employees for stepping in and serving our customers day in and day out during the strike. We are proud that our customer satisfaction results remained strong during this time, which demonstrates not only our planning but our commitment to placing customers first in our business.", "I'd also like to thank the vast majority of our associates for the respectful way in which they conducted themselves during the work stoppage. We look forward to continuing to work with our represented employees to better serve our customers and create work environments that will allow all of our employees to grow professionally.", "Overall, we continue to make progress on reducing our cost structure through workforce reductions and the new labor contract benefits that we just discussed. As always we're focused on driving efficiencies through our ongoing Lean Six Sigma program.", "So as I look at the first half of 2016, I'm pleased with what we have accomplished in a fast moving, challenging environment, and how far we have come repositioning ourselves strategically for the next decade.", "Now let me turn the call over to Fran to review second quarter performance in more detail, starting with our consolidated results on Slide 5.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Lowell. Good morning, everyone. On a reported basis total operating revenue declined 5.3% in the second quarter. If we exclude the second quarter 2015 revenues from the operations that we divested and exclude this quarter's revenue from AOL, which was not part of our operations a year ago, adjusted operating revenue would have declined approximately 3.5% on a comparable year-over-year basis. AOL once again delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter.", "In Wireless, service revenue as expected was pressured by the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans. Equipment revenue was also under pressure, due primarily to lower postpaid phone activations.", "Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled about $11.1 billion and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.3% in the quarter, compared to $11.8 billion a year ago. As Lowell just reviewed, we are reducing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiency in our operations throughout the business, which will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.", "Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 6. Cash flows from operations were $5.4 billion in the second quarter. Through the first half of the year, cash flows from operations totaled $12.8 billion, which is down $6.1 billion on a year-over-year basis, driven by the cash received from the tower transaction of $2.4 billion in the first quarter of 2015, a change in our method of monetizing device payment receivables, and an increase in cash taxes.", "Most of our device payment plan receivables originated in the second quarter were retained in contemplation of an asset-backed securitization transaction in the third quarter. This timing resulted in approximately $1.6 billion of working capital pressure.", "Free cash flow for the first half of the year totaled $5.6 billion (sic) [$5.5 billion].", "Subsequent to the quarter, we completed our first on balance sheet asset-backed securitization transaction with net proceeds of $1.1 billion, for which there was significant investor demand. Going forward, we expect to finance new device payment plan receivable originations with on balance sheet securitizations with a mix of bank transactions or public transactions. Public, or 144A, on balance sheet securitization as a funding channel provides several benefits, including diversification and lower borrowing costs with AAA ratings.", "Favorable captive finance treatment from two credit rating agencies is an offset to the financial statement impacts of on balance sheet financing. The financial statements will reflect an increase in receivables as new loans are originated. And debt will also reflect new securitization financings.", "Going forward, the cash flow statement will reflect securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. As a result, using on balance sheet financing will result in lower cash flows from operations, and therefore lower free cash flow, but will not reduce the cash we have available to run the business, as we plan to continue to securitize a significant amount of our receivables portfolio. We will provide additional disclosures on securitization in the third quarter.", "Cash taxes are higher compared to a year ago, as certain benefits that we realized in the prior period did not recur. And timing of tax deductions for early debt retirements varied. Cash taxes will increase in the second half of the year, primarily due to the taxes that will be paid related to the sale of our Wireline operations, which are approximately $3.2 billion.", "Our disciplined capital allocation model demonstrates our commitment to investing in businesses for the future.", "Capital expenditures were $3.9 billion in the quarter and $7.3 billion for the first half of the year. While the first half trend is lower than expected due to timing and the strike impact in Wireline, we reiterate our full year capital guidance of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.", "We ended the quarter with $99.7 billion of total debt, net debt of $96.9 billion, and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.2 times, which includes the liability management that we did in the quarter. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.", "Now let's move into reviews of the segments, starting with Wireless on Slide 7. Total Wireless operating revenues declined 4% in the quarter to $21.7 billion. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.4% for the quarter, an improvement from the year-over-year decline of 6.2% in the first quarter. Equipment revenue was $3.7 billion, down 4.1% due to lower activations.", "Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.1 billion in the second quarter. While service revenue will continue to be pressured by the migration of our customer base to the unsubsidized price plans, the decline has flattened as expected, now that we have approximately 53% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We recently refreshed the Verizon plans to enable increased customer control. We believe the pricing plans are resonating with our customers, providing value and functionality.", "As with any new pricing plan, we expect some account optimization early on. And we remain confident that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the fourth quarter of 2017.", "The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 67% in the second quarter, compared about 68% in the first quarter. The take rate, which was lower than our expectations, was due primarily to a higher mix of business customers in our overall postpaid phone activations for the quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. We recognize that new device launches could have an impact on take rate levels, but at this point it is too early to forecast any changes.", "During the quarter 5.2 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total we have about 31.8 million phone connections activated on a device payment plan, representing about 37% of our postpaid phone base.", "In terms of profitability we generated $10.3 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, an increase of 3.8%. And had a segment EBITDA margin of 47.5%, up from 43.9% a year ago.", "Now let's take a closer look at Wireless additions on Slide 8. Postpaid net adds, which does not include any wholesale connections, including Internet of Things, totaled 615,000. Overall, postpaid net additions declined sequentially, primarily due to increased tablet churn. Net phone additions increased sequentially to 86,000. We added 462,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter, which were offset by a net decline of 250,000 basic phones. The remaining offset in phone net adds were 3G devices.", "Tablet net adds totaled 356,000. All other postpaid devices totaling 173,000 were added during the quarter, with Verizon Wireless retail hum devices being the primary driver.", "Net prepaid devices declined by 30,000 for the quarter, which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year, due to the impact of new pricing plans for our prepaid market. Postpaid gross additions were 3.7 million, down from 3.9 million a year ago and flat sequentially. Retail postpaid churn was 0.94%, up 4 basis points from the prior year.", "We continue to see strong retention in our phone base, which is being offset by increasing tablet churn, stemming from the free tablet promotions from 2 years ago. We expect the higher rates of tablet churn to continue throughout the entire year.", "We ended the quarter with 113.2 million total retail connections, excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry leading postpaid connection base grew 3.9% to 107.8 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million.", "Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 9. Total postpaid device activations were 9.5 million in the quarter, down 4.3% sequentially and nearly 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 81% of these activations were phones, with tablets accounting for the majority of the other device activation. About 5.4% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the second quarter. This represents a decline of 180 basis points.", "Let's move next to our Wireline segment, starting with a review of our consumer and mass markets revenue performance on Slide 10. Consumer revenue declined 0.3% and mass markets, which includes small business, declined 1.2% on a comparable basis, excluding the properties sold to Frontier.", "Fios total revenue grew 3.7%. Fios revenue was strong, even with the work stoppage and a high prior-year comparable pay-per-view fight event. The growth in Fios is driven by a higher customer base and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 11% of our Fios Internet base has opted for speeds of 100 megabits or greater.", "We continue to see the downsizing of our video bundles and increased appetite for our custom TV package, which represented nearly 40% of Fios video sales in the quarter. Fios subscriber growth was impacted by the work stoppage in the second quarter. We made significant progress on working through the backlog of new installations in June and expect to return to a normal run rate in the third quarter.", "In Fios video net customers declined 41,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet net adds were negative 13,000. And net broadband subscribers decreased by 83,000. Fios Video penetration was 34.6% in the quarter, compared to 35.5% in the prior year, representing the decline of 90 basis points. Fios Internet penetration was 40.1% in the quarter, compared to 39.8% in the prior year, representing an increase of 30 basis points. We believe we have an opportunity to further penetrate the markets we serve.", "Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.4% in the second quarter, due to technology transitions and pricing pressures. In the second quarter global enterprise revenue declined 3.3%. And on a constant currency basis the decline was about the same. In our global wholesale business revenues declined 4.1% in the second quarter. Trends in our enterprise and global wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods.", "Wireline segment EBITDA margin in the quarter was 14%, which includes the impact of work stoppage, compared to 18.7% in the prior year. The pre-tax financial impact of the strike in the quarter was $489 million on the Wireline segment.", "In terms of improving the overall margin, we made improvements in cost structure by optimizing our workforce and expect benefits from the new labor contracts to be realized during the remainder of 2016 and in future years. Wireline capitalized labor expenditures slowed in the second quarter as we prioritized maintenance and repair activities over new installations during the work stoppage. We expect capital spending levels to increase in the second half of the year as we return to normal operations after the work stoppage.", "Let's move next to our summary slide. As expected, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We are focused on executing operationally, strategically and financially to deliver results today and prepare the business for future profitable growth. In the first half of the year in Wireless we added 1.3 million postpaid net customers and stabilized our Wireless service revenue declines. In Wireline we completed the sale of the operations in California, Florida, and Texas and negotiated new labor contracts which will have benefits into the future. We continue to be the network leader in the markets we serve. And we are setting the business up for growth.", "In our new businesses we enhanced our Video and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress. We are very excited about the work that has already been done, the integration of assets that we are beginning to do, and the acquisition of Yahoo to accelerate our Video platforms.", "As we enter the second half of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute and drive results. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015, excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage, consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full year 2015, consolidated capital spending between $17.2 billion and $17.7 billion, a minimum pension funding requirement of approximately $550 million, and our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes to be in the range of 35% to 36%. We also expect GDP-type growth in consolidated revenue for the full year 2017.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you, Fran. Tori, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks and good morning, guys. Maybe quick \u2013 couple quick questions for Lowell. Lowell, first of all, could you give us an early look at the synergies that you see coming with the Yahoo transaction? And with it behind you now, do you feel that you have the assets you need to execute on the new media strategy? Thanks.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, good morning, John, and good morning, everyone. I understand there were lots of rumors about me announcing a big reorganization of the company, so I'm sorry to disappoint you. But I think we have some pretty exciting things to talk about here.", "First, on Yahoo synergy. Look, certainly as we went into the auction process, we had a very good idea of what the synergies could be. I think probably we were the only significant bidder that had synergies. So we have a good idea, and we've heard numbers bantered around that are in the ballpark.", "But my view on this, John, is we now enter a phase where post the auction diligence, which is certainly limited, we can go in and talk to management and see a much greater depth of information. And we'll validate our plans and make our decisions. So I think as we get closer to closing, which we expect will be either at the end of the year or early in the first quarter, we'll announce those numbers. But they're meaningful, let me just put it that way.", "On the \u2013 do we have the assets we need? Certainly yesterday when Marni [Walden] and Tim [Armstrong] did their public interviews, we're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo has in the area of sports and finance and email and news. And you match those up with AOL, we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here.", "But I'll give you the answer that I always give you, John, when we talk about capital. And you say, well, are you finally done expanding and are you going to reduce your capital? And my answer always is, I hope not. Because if we do, then we're standing still. And this is such a dynamic environment, we should be looking for additional things to meet customers' needs.", "And I fully expect that when Tim and Marissa [Mayer] put their heads together, we'll have a long list. And we'll be disciplined as we always are. And they'll be good investments that'll drive us to take a larger share of this growing market.", "So there's been a lot made of, oh, are we going to challenge Google and Facebook in this process? I just say, look, we plan on being a significant player here. The market is going to grow dramatically. We're a small player today relative to them. All we need to do is take more than our fair share of the growth of the market and this will be a success for us. And we certainly expect to do better than that.", "John Christopher Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "Great.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Great. Thanks, John. We appreciate the question. Next question, Tori?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may now ask your question.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks very much. Good morning. Fran, I think you were one of the early ones to talk about elongating handset cycles. I think what we've seen so far with three companies reporting is very low upgrade rates, relatively low switching, but also low adds, low churn. To what extent do you think this is a typical sort of pre-iPhone lull? Or do you think we're in a new environment of more subdued activity going forward?", "And in particular as you think about your growth, you talked about the ARPU stabilizing and service revenues returning. But you also need stronger volume growth. What can you do to stimulate more of the phone adds as we go forward here? Thanks. And anything you can say on the data center sale as well would be appreciated.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "All right, great. Thanks, Simon. So on handset cycles, so two viewpoints here. One is obviously we saw a similar trend \u2013 maybe not this dramatic \u2013 in 2014 where we saw a slowdown in the first half of the year in anticipation of iconic phones that were coming up on a 2-year cycle. So I think some of it could be that.", "Unfortunately for us though, we have our first set of EIP customers coming up on their 2-year anniversary. And there's not enough volume yet of those customers to really get a behavior track, if you will, whether they're going to hold their phone and take a $20 to $25 discount on their bill or if they're just waiting for a new phone.", "So I think it's too early to tell. We'll have a better feel for this as we go into the second quarter (sic). And that's why in my prepared remarks, I said it's too early to reforecast. But as I've said consistently, I think our volumes will be similar to 2015.", "As far as the, how do we stimulate phone, smartphone growth? Look, I've been saying for over a year now that smartphone growth is going to continue to slow. And we have to look at other areas for that growth, obviously tablets being one. And we have a little bit of a headwind there.", "But if you look at the gross adds of tablet, we added over a million tablets this quarter. So we are having pressure in the churn metric for that free tablet promotion that we did 2 years ago. And we will continue to have that pressure throughout the rest of the year. But if you look at the momentum of hum and you look at the other adds that we did, these are the types of devices that we want to add to the account to increase our revenue overall.", "And if you look at the underlying ARPA, which is the installment and revenue per unit, that increased to 2.6% this quarter. So you can see the underlying revenue of our base is actually increasing. Unfortunately, you're not seeing it in the results, because the math of moving from the subsidized to the unsubsidized is declining that.", "The last comment I'll make here on this topic is service revenue. So you saw the 80 basis [point] improvement on service revenue. And as we've continued to say, once we crossed over that 50% mark, and now we're at 53% of the base on the unsubsidized pricing, we are starting to see that service revenue math take effect and that decline starting to reverse.", "So an 80 basis point this quarter. I continue to see that through the rest of the year we will improve. I will say that there won't be as much of an improvement in third quarter, because of the new pricing and some of the optimization. But we will see improvement. And I continue to see this trend going through the end of 2017, which I'm still confident that we will show accretion at the end of 2017.", "Finally, on the data center sales we are coming to an end of the process. And we will probably come to a definitive answer in the third quarter as to whether we're going to move forward or we're not. And so I'll hold comment for the third quarter for that.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Tori, next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael I. Rollins - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Oh, thanks. If I could follow up on Yahoo for a moment. In a letter that was picked up by the press from Yahoo's CEO yesterday, it referred to Verizon's goal to get to a global audience of 2 billion users and $20 billion of revenue within the mobile media business by 2020. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about that goal in a couple of respects? In terms of what are the key strategies to get that growth? Is it simply just leveraging the assets you have? Or can you give us a little more color on how you look to maybe manage them differently than they've been managed in the past?", "And then secondly, how should investors think about the profitability of that type of revenue in this category over time? Thanks.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I'll \u2013 let me take the strategic question. And then Fran can talk a little bit more about the profit side.", "Mike, I think this is similar to my answer to John's question. We've got a perspective going into this, and we'll refine it as we go along. But if you take a look at the interest that we have received from AOL current partners as well as new partners, we think there's a huge opportunity in the following areas.", "First, in the sports area. As you know we've got relationships with a lot of the big leagues. Certainly NFL and NBA are the headliners for us. I've spoken with both Roger Goodell and Adam Silver in the last few weeks about this. And I think we're very excited. And I expect over the next few months you'll see more details about the plan of what we can do with their content, not only in season but out of season. And there are other sports leagues that we have the opportunity to work with.", "Some of other big names, I'm not going to tip our hand here just yet. But the networks and their sports channels see an opportunity to partner with us. They may already have NBA rights or NFL rights. And we can work on streaming their games, not only through the traditional channels of Fios, either Custom TV or the full bundles, but over AOL and Yahoo and then finally over go90. So we view this as a waterfall of content moving down through our different properties.", "The next one is Yahoo Finance. That's probably their strongest asset today. We'll learn more about that. But as you look at again some of the networks that have finance channels, and frankly some of the other folks that were bidding on this, we think there's an opportunity for us to work with them in partnership to realize some of their visions and some of our visions.", "And then certainly news, as you would expect, and the email platforms, we see ways that we can combine some of our assets and some of their assets, the TechCrunch, the Engadgets, the Huffington Post. And we can drive a lot of visits to the site.", "So I think the different for us is we have a lot of \u2013 us versus the Yahoo management \u2013 we have a lot of the relationships well-established, because of our Fios and our mobile assets. And we can combine them with their platforms and their leadership expertise to deliver a very good lineup here.", "So I think on the profitability side, Fran, I don't know. Any comments you have on that? But that's where we'll head from a strategic perspective, Mike.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, Mike. What I would say is everything that Lowell said. And we're looking at this as a portfolio of assets. And as I said during this whole process, look, Yahoo brings viewers, viewers brings advertising, advertising brings top line growth. So the first thing here is to scale, to drive that top line growth. We believe that with the combination of all these assets, we have a lot of revenue synergy upside. So the first will be to drive the top line. And then as Tim has shown, and along with the Yahoo team, we'll drive the profitability that's required to generate the cash flow that we forecast. So that's the top priority right now.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Mike, thank you. Tori, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks so much, guys, for taking the questions. Maybe two if I could. First, Fran, you highlighted a GDP level of revenue growth next year. I think in the past you've talked about a kind of mid- to high-single digit normal earnings growth expectation for next year. Could you just kind of confirm that those two are the same thing?", "And then second, just I think in Lowell's commentary, he kind of referenced a view that spectrum is not necessarily the be-all, end-all for creating capacity at the margin. In the notes out this morning you noted that 93% of the data traffic is on LTE capacity. I was wondering if you could kind of refresh us as to where or how much of your spectrum portfolio is dedicated to LTE? And how much is still available to be tapped to kind of continue to support that 40% plus growth rate in consumption? Thanks.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, David. Thanks for your question. Let me go first on the spectrum side. And then Fran can cover the first part of your question about growth rates.", "Today, just to say it, about 50% of our spectrum is dedicated to 4G LTE. We still have some spectrum on 2G. We're refarming our CDMA spectrum as we go forward. And I expect that we've got plenty of headroom here.", "The point of my comments \u2013 and Boston is our good example there \u2013 is the farther we push fiber out into the network, the more small cell technology works for us. And the cost trade off that we expected prior to the last auction told us that we would be better off going with the small cells than we would paying the prices that were \u2013 that the spectrum was demanding.", "At the Super Bowl last year we went in and built out San Francisco and proved that thesis was correct. We were actually more conservative than we needed to be. The Boston effort that we've got underway now will further solidify that opinion.", "And then as we densify the network for 4G, it sets us up perfectly for deploying 5G with the millimeter wave technology. So we're extremely pleased that the FCC approved the XO lease arrangement yesterday, because now we have a clear field in front of us to not only densify with 4G, but use that same capital dollar to get the infrastructure in place for 5G. So we think we're in a very strong competitive position here.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, David, on the second part on the 2017 numbers. Yes, GDP revenue growth for 2017. And we've done a lot of work behind this obviously. What we've talked about around service revenue plays a big factor in this and the comps year over year.", "But we believe some of these other things start to \u2013 really start to generate some top-line revenue, like IoT, 25% year-over-year growth rate now. We see that accelerating. Tablets, we believe once we get through the churn headwind of the free promo, they will become a bigger contributing factor next year. So there's a lot of things that go into that. But we're pretty confident on that GDP growth.", "And then on the bottom line, all I've said \u2013 I've never again a percentage. But all I've said is a normal growth rate for Verizon. And what that means is exclude the last 2 prior years, where we bought Vodafone and got a 10% increment over our normal growth rate. And then of course the prior year, which was impacted by the EIP accounting. So that's all I've said. And we'll talk more about that when we get to the first quarter of next year.", "David William Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, guys.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Tori, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, it's Phil. So first of all, can you help us understand the progress on the 5G trials? What are you learning about the cost of deployment? Usable distances and speeds?", "And then, Fran, you mentioned tablets are slower, but you do expect a rebound once churn falls away. Do these add value? Is it mostly just sort of tacking on and pulling those customers in more tightly? Or do they actually add value economically on their own? Thanks.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I'll take the first part again on 5G. What we've had so far, Phil, is we've got a big deployment down in Dallas working with Ericsson and Nokia. We've got several in New Jersey and some down in Virginia.", "We've typically seen speeds above 1 gigabit over, let's just say, 500 yards or less, because of the confined space that we've got available to us. With that sort of speed we've been able to put up six ultra high definition TVs, six virtually reality units, numerous tablets, et cetera. So and those services are only drawing in the 300 megs to 400 megs of throughput. So lots of head room.", "Now the process we're moving into now is actually going out into a field environment, where we can cover a 200 home development. And see with normal vegetation, with difference in weather patterns where we think these critical parameters are going to go.", "Theoretically, looks, 1,000 meters or so between cell sites seems to be reasonable. But again we've got to verify that. We're going to go into some rural environments to see whether that propagation changes based on demand. We'll know a lot more as we go along.", "From a pure cost perspective, again I think it's a little too early to tell. But what I'll tell you is about half of our cost to deploy Fios is in the home today. And the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop.", "And so our take is that with the router roughly costing the same \u2013 and remember we wouldn't have to have an ONT as we think about it today. So as the \u2013 when we deploy 4G and densify, that small cell can contain 5G for very little incremental cost. And with the router in the house being probably less than an ONT and router combination today, and losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop, we expect there to be a significant cost reduction.", "But we'll know a lot more as we finish these trials. And I fully expect that as we wrap these trials up, we'll actually be bringing some analysts and some of media to the field to take a look at these deployments, so that you can judge for yourself. Fran?", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And then, Phil, on second part on tablets. So absolutely we view as tablets as adding value. So traditionally you would say, well a tablet that's added to a Wireless account just gives you a minimal amount of access revenue. And that's far less than a smartphone. And all that is true.", "But if you look at the entire ecosystem that we're developing here, more people who have tablets, we know watch more video on a tablet. And if you think about what Lowell outlined on our whole video strategy, along with go90, AOL, Yahoo coming into the portfolio fold, we're trying to drive more usage into these devices. And we want those users to consume our content, which then ultimately drives advertising. So we're looking at the value of these instruments if you will more from a holistic standpoint.", "So yes. I mean today it's 11.4% of the base. I still believe that there is a huge growth opportunity here in the base with tablets and where technology is going. And that's going to generate not only access revenue on the Wireless side of the house, but it's also going to generate a lot of, if you will, media co type revenue for the future portfolio of digital advertising.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. I understand. Thanks, Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Tori, if you can tee up the next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Two if I may. Just following up on Phil's point. Lowell, you mentioned doing in Boston into other cities. Can I just explore that a little bit? Are you talking in your franchise footprint, your Wireline footprint, or going outside of that? Because I guess the logical next question would be outside of that, how do you work with the incumbents there if you're kind of trying to cannibalize their main business?", "And then secondly, if you can offer any question \u2013 or commentary on FirstNet? If you guys are there? And any thoughts on that? Thanks a lot.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. First on the cities, Jennifer. Well absolutely there's no boundary here on our Wireline footprint. Obviously, we have a stronger position in the Washington to Boston corridor. We can move to market more quickly. But we don't view that as a barrier at all.", "And in fact we are talking to other cities. And I mentioned San Francisco, because we made a huge deployment with the Super Bowl. And we're going to leverage that in our work with them. But there's no boundary.", "Now as far as cannibalization, there's an awful lot of dark fiber providers out there. And we've had a lot of discussions with them. And they're very happy to sell. And they've got very good footprints that get deep into some of these networks.", "As I mentioned, we've obviously just purchased XO, 40 metro fiber rings, which get us into a very strong position. And there's companies out there like XO. So we don't view any issue there.", "As far as FirstNet, under federal contracting rules we really can't comment about that while there's an RFP in process. So I'm sorry. I can't make any comment there.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Jennifer, thank you. Next question, Tori?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks for taking the question. Lowell, early on you started off talking about the importance of network. It's interesting, investors have increasingly been asking whether networks really are sufficiently differentiated versus what we've been accustomed to. And of course some of your competitors are arguing that actually there is not a lot of differentiation anymore and people should be more focused on things like price. So I was hoping we could come back to that.", "And then just if we think about the evolution of how you've differentiated, it used to be you differentiated on the reliability of voice. More recently it's been the reliability of data and data speeds. Where is the battleground shifting? And how are you going to make sure you continue to be differentiated based on where that's going?", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Brett, thanks. I think since we started with the original network reliability message back in 2000, those that weren't number one have constantly said networks don't matter. And customers have voted that networks do matter. And all you have to do is look at the churn.", "And I'd argue that if you need to sell your product at half of what Verizon sells theirs, that's proof alone that networks matter, if you have to take that sort of a haircut. I know it's shocking, but occasionally advertisements are out there that aren't completely truthful. But that's the world that we live in.", "As far as differentiation, as we say around the business, I think we've said this in other \u2013 I don't think it's made it to an ad yet, but, \"Can you hear me now?\" has really moved to, \"Can you see me now?\" And that's because we've moved away from voice being a channel and an application by itself on these networks to, it just rides the data stream.", "And so the throughputs, the latency, that's where the battleground shifts. And how we stay ahead is by densifying the 4G LTE network, but then driving very hard to 5G. Because we've seen this time and time again throughout the history of Verizon \u2013 and I'd argue throughout the history of Wireless \u2013 is if you build it, they'll come. And the more we build, the more speeds that we deliver, the more ubiquitous the network is, the customers just soak up that broadband capacity.", "Verizon has always been the one that is pushing the envelope here. And we continue to do that. So I hope everyone on the call sees that by aggressively moving to densification and then using that same infrastructure to build out 5G, Verizon is going to stay on the leading edge for the next decade.", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Tori, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.", "Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Hi. Thank you. Two quick questions if I could. Lowell, can you talk about the FCC's Privacy NPRM and what could be significantly stricter rules for ISPs, like Verizon, relative to edge providers like Google or Facebook? Did that impact your thinking about what you could pay for Yahoo and how you monetize Yahoo in any way?", "And then second, just a more tactical question. Can you talk about the Fios installation backlogs coming out of the work stoppage and what we can expect with some rebound there?", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, good morning, Craig. So on the FCC Privacy NPRM \u2013 and I'd also apply this to the set top box side. We're not a big fan of regulation in general. We'd rather let the markets work. But if there's going to be regulation, then we think it ought to be for all the players in the ecosystem.", "And I know \u2013 and I've talked with Tom Wheeler. And I have great respect for what he's doing. He's only got so many tools in his toolbox to help set some of the standards here. But we're encouraging a broader action here that might involve the FTC or others, so that everyone in the ecosystem is treated the same. And I think that's our philosophy on set top box. That's our philosophy on privacy.", "Did it impact us on Yahoo? No, not particularly. We look at that as a standalone business. Certainly the regulatory environment always enters into your thinking. But we would do Yahoo regardless of however that NPRM turns out. And we think it's going to be a dynamic business for us going forward. So I hope that helps.", "Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Yeah, thank you.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And then, Craig, on the Fios installation backlogs. Yes, obviously coming out of the \u2013 when we settled with the representative employees, there was a large backlog. I would tell you as we sit here right now today, that backlog is down to a normal.", "But I would say that in my prepared remarks I said we would get back to a normal growth in the third quarter. But I'll caveat that comment let's say that, look, during the strike we discontinued old advertising. And it takes about 60 days to 90 days to ramp that back up. So albeit the third quarter will be a more positive quarter for us, it probably won't be as much as a normal third quarter for us. So a little less than norm. And then we feel that we'll be back in stride by fourth quarter. So that kind of lays the land of how we think about Fios backlog and installation going forward.", "Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thanks, Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Tori, we have time for one last question. If you can place that through.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks, guys. Fran, between 5G and if you look at platform and solutions, how much could this drive your overall revenue growth in 2018, 2019? Is this enough to drive almost all the GDP-like growth that you're looking for?", "And just maybe on the platform side, can you talk about what partners really like most about the platform and what else you're looking to do to it to kind of make it unique to attract more content partners? Thanks.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I'll let Fran take the first part there, Tim. So the second part, I assume you're assuming Yahoo. Right?", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Correct, sorry. And AOL, yeah.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So look, I think the items that I mentioned around the sports, finance, and news are really the big items there. If you look at Tim's numbers, he's in the hundreds of millions of users. Yahoo is well over a billion users. So you start putting those numbers together, and there's some significant reach here.", "I think every content provider \u2013 and I think it's fair to say whether you're an advocate for the 300 channel bundle or over-the-top, you realize that this is moving more and more toward digital distribution. And the partnership of AOL and Yahoo gives them the ability to reach those specific customers.", "If you look at our purchase of Complex, Complex has more visitors per month now than ESPN does in that male millennial. And AwesomenessTV has those same sort of numbers for female millennials.", "So it gives, whether you're thinking you're part of a large network, sports distribution or you're the actual league or you're trying to deliver finance or other news, being able to tap into that is a huge opportunity. The big advertisers have come to us, saying that they have more ads to place than they have good places to put them. And so you will hear from us over the next several months some partnerships and some agreements to place ads with us.", "And then the final probably obvious one to everyone, but we have 113.2 million mobile users. And people are accessing all of this content via their mobile device. And we'll be one of the few that can deliver advertising and content across the home, across the mobile device, and across the Internet. And we think that puts us in a very strong position.", "Francis J. Shammo - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And then, Tim, on the second part of this, I can honestly tell you that within the comments I made, there is actually nothing related to 5G as far as revenue goes. And the reason for that is, is because we looked at 2017 as a development year for 5G. By the time that we get the licenses \u2013 now we got a great ruling yesterday by the FCC on allowing us to use the leases. So that could accelerate some of that.", "But I will tell you to get to a commercial launch and actually start to generate revenue, I think that will come in either very late 2017 or early 2018. But there is nothing in the forecast right now based on the guidance I gave.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Okay. That's all the time for questions. But before we end the call, I'd like to turn it back to Lowell.", "Lowell C. McAdam - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you, Mike, and I'd also like to thank Fran for taking us through the results. And all of the analysts, I appreciate your questions. I wish we could have gotten to more, but Mike will be available throughout the day. I know we also have a lot of reporters on the phone, and Jim Gerace and our Public Relations team will be available to answer your questions.", "Both Fran and I will be out visiting with our large investors over the next several weeks. So we expect to be able to tell our story and answer more questions on a number of fronts here.", "I realize that it's been a long call today, and we've covered a lot of topics, both operationally and strategically. But given what we said last year about 2016 being a plateau for us on earnings and given the acquisitions that we've completed \u2013 obviously Yahoo the most significant now front of us \u2013 we thought it was good to give you this sort of an overview and update.", "Before we end I just want to make sure we have a few points that don't get lost. The team is very focused on delivering on our fundamental operational execution. We continue to be a leader in network quality and customer loyalty and in financial performance.", "On the strategic front obviously we're aggressively building new businesses with revenue and ecosystems that are expanding the industry and enhancing the revenue profile of the company. Certainly we don't kid ourselves about execution. We've been executing, bringing new businesses into the portfolio since we started this back in 1999. But just as we have in the past, we're determined to lead the next growth surge and create value for our shareholders. And hopefully after today you see that path as clearly as we do.", "So thank you all for covering Verizon and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the conference call for today. Thank you for your participation and for using Verizon conference services.

At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be opened for questions following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Thanks, Jay. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Fran Shammo and Matt Ellis, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Finance Operations and Chief Financial Officer designee. Thank you for joining us this morning.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, the investor quarterly, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements about expected future events and financial results that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may affect future results are discussed in our filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation includes non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available on our website.", "The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are an on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Fran reviews the third quarter results, I'd like to highlight a few items from our quarterly earnings. For the third quarter of 2016 we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several significant non-operational items that I would like to highlight.", "Our reported earnings include a noncash pre-tax loss of $797 million. The pretax pension re-measurement adjustment due to settlement accounting resulted in a $555 charge and severance costs related to existing separation plans amounted to $242 million. The net impact after tax approximated $500 million or $0.12 per share.", "In third quarter 2015 earnings includes $0.05 per share of a noncash charge due to pension re-measurement. Excluding the effect of these nonoperational items, adjusted earnings per share was $1.01 in the third quarter a decline of 2.9% compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Additionally, in the quarter we executed on our first on balance sheet asset-backed securitization transactions totaling $2.6 billion.", "The cash flow statement reflects asset-backed securitization proceeds in financing cash flow rather than operating cash flow. This captioning impacts the free cash flow metric, but overall net cash available remains unchanged relative to off-balance-sheet securitization. We plan to continue to securitize equipment receivables with on balance sheet financings in future periods.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Fran.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thank you, Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2016 continues to be a transformational year for us just as we had outlined over a year ago. During this transformation we are executing on a very challenging competitive environment, investing and positioning for the future growth and returning value to our shareholders.", "Competitive activity in the wireless market increased during the third quarter as expected and we responded in a measured way to grow and retain our valuable customer base by introducing new wireless plans and discipline promotions. We have been successful in retaining our high value postpaid smartphone base and improving service revenue trends. In the wireline market we returned to a strong quarter of execution following the strike that impacted the second quarter.", "We grew our Fios base and improved the consumer revenue trend. We are focused on continuously improving our overall cost structure through process improvements and operating efficiencies. This execution enabled us to deliver overall strong margins and adjusted earnings per share.", "We remain focused on our disciplined capital allocation that consists of investing for growth, returning value to shareholders and preserving our strong balance sheet. Our investments are consistent with our three-tier strategy starting with investing in our network by expanding our wireless capacity and prepositioning for future growth in both 4G and 5G. We continue to lead in all third-party measures for network performance and reliability. We are investing in new growth businesses in digital media technology to extend our ability to monetize the usage on our networks and create new revenue streams from advertising, content rights, telematics and other IOT solutions.", "In early September, our Board of Directors approved a 2.2% dividend increase which raises our annualized dividend to $2.31 per share. This was the 10th consecutive year that our board has approved a dividend increase endorsing their confidence in the strength of our balance sheet and returning value to our shareholders.", "Let's move to third quarter performance in more detail starting with our consolidated results on Slide 6. Our third quarter results highlight our ability to execute in a challenging environment and drive strong operating and financial results. On a reported basis, total operating revenue decreased 6.7% in the third quarter. This decrease was primarily due to the sale of the three wireline markets to Frontier which closed on April 1, 2016 and the wireless commercial pricing model change. Excluding the impact of wireline divestiture, consolidated revenue was down 2.9%.", "In terms of wireless revenue, the service revenue trend was on track with our expectations for the migration of our postpaid subscriber base to unsubsidized price plans and optimization of our current customers to the new pricing plans. Equipment revenue, which started the quarter slowly due to low volumes ended strong with the introduction of the iPhone 7. Wireline revenue trends were consistent with previous quarters.", "Consolidated adjusted EBITDA totaled $11.3 billion up 1% and our adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.5% up 140 basis points in the quarter. We remain focused on enhancing our overall cost structure by improving productivity and gaining efficiencies in our operations throughout the business which we expect will enable us to deliver a strong earnings profile into the future.", "Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on Slide 7. Cash flows from operations were $4.8 billion in the third quarter. Keep in mind as we shift to the asset-backed securitization model, there is $2.6 billion of cash that is reflected in the financing section of the cash flow statement, while in prior periods under the off-balance-sheet securitization model this funding would have flowed from cash flow from operations.", "Free cash flow for the nine months of the year totaled $6.2 billion which was impacted by our on balance sheet securitization transactions. Cash taxes for the quarter were higher compared to a year ago primarily due to transaction tax payments of $2.4 billion. This amount represented the majority of total taxes due for the gain on the sale of our wireline operations to Frontier earlier this year. The remainder is expected to be paid next quarter. The increase was also affected by certain benefits that we realized in prior periods which did not occur in this period.", "Capital expenditures were $4.1 billion in the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless for densification and in wireline for Fios installations as volumes expanded post work stoppage. We now expect full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the low end of the range of $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion.", "We ended the quarter with $106.6 billion of total debt which includes $2.6 billion of asset-backed securitization debt, net debt of $100.2 billion and a ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA of 2.3 times. The net debt includes the asset-backed securitization debt. We remain on track to return to our pre-Vodafone credit rating profile by the 2018 to 2019 timeframe.", "Now let's move into reviews of the segments starting with wireless on Slide 8. Service revenue of $16.7 billion declined 5.2% for the quarter compared to a decline of 5.4% in the second quarter. Service revenue plus installment billings increased 2.3% to $19.3 billion in the third quarter. Service revenue trends are consistent with our expectations as the postpaid base migrates to the unsubsidized price plans. We now have approximately 60% of our postpaid phone customers on the unsubsidized price plans. We continue to expect that we will return to year-over-year service revenue growth by the end of 2017.", "Equipment revenue was $4.1 billion down 3.9% due to lower equipment volumes. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 70% in the third quarter compared with about 67% in the second quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth quarter to be around 70% given the higher seasonal consumer mix of volumes.", "During the quarter 6.1 million phones were activated on a device payment plan. In total we have about 35.8 million phone connections activated on the device payment plan representing 41% of our postpaid phone base. Total wireless operating revenues decreased 3.9% in the quarter to $22.1 billion.", "The cost structure in wireless continues to improve driven by streamlining of business process improvements in distribution, care and supply chain resulting in higher digital customer contact and lower transaction costs. In terms of profitability, we generated $9.9 billion of segment EBITDA in the quarter, flat with last year and we had a segment EBITDA margin of 44.9% up 170 basis points from 43.2%.", "Now let's take a closer look at wireless additions on Slide 9. Total postpaid net adds, which we do not include any wholesale connections including Internet of Things totaled 442,000. Within the postpaid net additions we added 357,000 new 4G smartphones in the quarter which were partially offset by a net decline of 3G smartphones resulting in 242,000 net new high-quality smartphones.", "Overall net phone additions were a negative 36,000 due to the offset of basic phones and softer phone gross additions. Tablet net additions totaled 221,000. All other postpaid net additions totaled 257,000 with Verizon Wireless retail Hum devices being the primary driver.", "Postpaid gross additions were 3.8 million down from 4.2 million and up slightly from last quarter. Retail postpaid churn was 1.04% up 11 basis points driven by tablet churn. As we have previously discussed, we expect this higher rate of tablet churn to continue into the first half of next year as two-year agreements associated with prior tablet promotional offers roll off. We continue to see strong retention in our retail postpaid phone base. Postpaid phone churn was up 2 basis points from a year ago and remain below 0.90% for the sixth consecutive quarter.", "Net prepaid additions increased to 83,000 for the quarter which is a significant improvement sequentially and from the prior year due to the impact of new price plans for our prepaid market. We ended the quarter with 113.7 million total retail connections excluding all wholesale connections. Our industry-leading postpaid connection base grew 3% to 108.2 million and our prepay connections totaled 5.5 million.", "Let's now take a look at 4G device activations and upgrades on Slide 10. Total postpaid device activations were 10.7 million in the quarter up 12.2% sequentially and down nearly 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Approximately 82% of these activations were phones with tablets accounting for the majority of other device activations.", "About 6.3% of our retail postpaid base upgraded to a new device in the third quarter. This represents a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year and up from 5.4% in the prior quarter. Our upgrades and momentum in the third quarter were negatively impacted by the recall of the Note 7. Additionally, we experienced an iPhone 7 backlog primarily for upgrades.", "Let's move next to our Wireline segment starting with the review of our consumer and mass-markets revenue performance on Slide 11. Consumer revenue increased 0.2% at mass market's which include small business declined 0.5%. Fios total revenue grew 4.4% with consumer Fios revenue rising 4.2%. The growth in Fios was driven by a higher customer base, strong retention programs and the demand for higher Internet speeds. Approximately 16% of our Fios Internet based has opted for speeds of 100 Mb or greater. We continue to see strong demand consistent with prior quarters for custom TV.", "During the third quarter we returned to normal seasonal volumes ahead of our expectations coming out of the work stoppage. Fios Internet subscriber growth was strong in the third quarter. In broadband we added 90,000 net Fios customers for the quarter which were at pre-work stoppage levels. Overall net broadband subscribers increased by 24,000 in the quarter. Fios Internet penetration was 40.4% in the quarter compared to 40.1% representing an increase of 30 basis points.", "In Fios video we added 36,000 net customers in the quarter which was also consistent with pre-work stoppage levels. Fios video penetration was 34.5% in the quarter compared to 35.4% representing a decline of 90 basis points driven by increased open-for-sale markets and softer linear TV demand. We continue to see an opportunity to further penetrate the Fios markets we serve.", "Let's turn to Slide 12 and cover enterprise and wholesale as well as the Wireline segment in total. Total operating revenues for the Wireline segment declined 2.3% in the third quarter consistent with recent trends. In the third quarter, global enterprise revenue declined 3.4% and on a constant currency basis the decline was about 2.9%. In our wholesale business, revenues decreased 3.9% in the third quarter. Trends in our global enterprise and wholesale businesses remained consistent with prior periods. However, we expect that in the fourth quarter we will see a decline in wholesale in the range of 7% to 9% due to nonrecurring items in the prior year.", "Wireline segment EBITDA margin was 21.2% compared to 18.9% in the period last year up 230 basis points due to Fios growth and cost management. We believe we will continue to make progress in expanding the Wireline EBITDA margin. As we expected, Wireline capital spending levels increased in the third quarter as we returned to normal operations after the work stoppage in the second quarter.", "Let's move next to Slide 13 and cover strategic positioning and investments. Network leadership is our primary objective in the markets we serve. We are investing in our networks and building capacity for the future and positioning our business for new industry growth opportunities. Recently, we launched LTE Advanced in over 460 markets delivering improved service to more than 90% of the U.S. population.", "We are steadily advancing our cloud and software defined network architecture and moving forward aggressively with our densification efforts and prepositioning for 5G technology. Our one fiber strategy initiative is on track and we are building our next-generation fiber network in the city of Boston.", "In July the FCC approved our millimeter wave spectrum band lease agreement with XO Communications clearing the way for testing 5G technology in different environments. Our 5G technical trials have been successful and we are now planning a commercial pilot program in 2017 where we will test the technology in different environments with several infrastructure providers to determine ability to scale and operationalized fixed wireless product offerings. Based on the outcome of our commercial pilot program, Verizon intends to be the first company to launch a 5G fixed wireless broadband solution in the United States.", "In the third quarter network usage increased 45%. Digital video is the primary driver of traffic on our network. In order to participate in the digital media value chain, we have assembled assets to grow in the digital media business. We have accumulated a large portfolio of digital rights and invested in specific assets to distribute, publish and create digital content.", "In order to drive incremental value from digital media traffic we are scaling and leveraging AOL's ADTECH capabilities to monetize digital impressions on and off our network. We believe we are strategically well-positioned with the right set of assets to grow in this expanding market. In the third quarter AOL's net revenue measured as gross revenue less traffic acquisition costs amounted to $486 million which represented an increase of approximately 10%.", "Net revenue growth was primarily driven by advertising revenue from programmatic platforms. Over the next two quarters we expect AOL net revenue to follow seasonal trends, but year-over-year growth to be lower due to one-time benefits in the prior year from the Microsoft deal especially in the fourth quarter.", "We are seeing strong demand from advertisers for AOL's expanding programmatic capabilities and high quality data analytic tools. We expect that the pending acquisition of Yahoo will further expand our scale in the digital media space. This would place us in a unique position to serve unmet customer needs, participate in digital publishing and video and to monetize the content.", "On the go90 platform, the level of viewer engagement as measured by daily usage has been rising steadily since re-platforming the application earlier this summer. In the third quarter, the average daily usage in go90 surpassed more than 30 minutes per viewer with less than 20% of traffic served on the Verizon wireless network. While still early in its product cycle, we are very encouraged by the traction with users primarily attracted by unique content.", "For example in July we introduced an original streaming monthly reality series titled \"The Runner.\" Viewers can watch episodes aired three times daily via the go90 app, go90.com and AOL.com. The innovative game format with an emphasis on live user participation contributed to strong usage and engagement. During the quarter we expanded go90 participation in FreeBee Data 360, a sponsor data service which allows customers to screen live sports including NFL games and music without accounting against the Verizon data. We are seeing increased engagement in the application.", "In September with our partner Hearst, we announced the formation of Complex Networks which brings together complex and digital video networks RatedRed.com and seriously.tv. In the United States Complex reaches more than half of the male 18 to 24 population and it is one of the largest properties for this population. The content produced in this partnership will be available on go90 which we expect will further increase user engagement and traffic growth.", "The rapidly evolving Internet of Things market provides us with new business opportunities for our customers globally. We intend to scale Telematics, ThingSpace, Smart City and other IOT solutions globally. Organically IOT revenues were $217 million up 24% from the comparable period last year. Including two months of Telogis activity IOT revenues were up more than 30% in the quarter. IOT revenues were primarily driven by Telematics. Telogis which closed in July expands our Telematics capabilities targeted for the enterprise space.", "In July we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fleetmatics, a global software-as-a-service based telematics provider in the small and medium-sized business space for $2.4 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. In September we completed the purchase of Sensity Systems, a leading provider of IOT solutions for Smart City. This transaction closed in October. The acquisition adds a leading comprehensive suite of Smart City solutions to our IOT platform. We are now focused on integrating the assets.", "Now let's turn to Slide 14 for an overall summary. As we stated coming into the year, 2016 is a significant transformational year for us. We continue to deliver consistent performance during this transitional period. We are executing in a competitive environment. For the third quarter, despite a challenging competitive environment in wireless we added over 42,000 postpaid net customers, retained high-value postpaid phone customers and improved our wireless service revenue trends.", "In Wireline, Fios performance was ahead of our expectations. In both wireless and wireline, we have made significant progress on improving our cost structure. We continue to invest in our networks and platforms to be the network leader in the markets we serve and we are setting up the business to return to growth in 2017. We are focused on developing new business models and revenue streams. In our new businesses we are scaling our media assets and Internet of Things platforms to position us for long-term growth and are demonstrating progress.", "As we enter the final quarter of the year, we are confident in our ability to execute, deliver results and return value to shareholders while transforming the business. We are on course for our 2016 guidance and expectations. Full-year adjusted earnings to be at a level comparable to 2015 excluding the $0.07 impact of work stoppage. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin consistent with full-year 2015, consolidated capital spending at the low end of the $17.2 billion to $17.7 billion range.", "We made a full year total pension contribution of approximately $750 million which consists of minimum funding of approximately $550 million and a discretionary contribution of about $200 million. We expect our full year 2016 effective tax rate to be in the range of 35% to 36%. While we will be providing more guidance in January, we expect that organically consolidated revenue growth in 2017 will be at a level consistent with GDP growth for that year and adjusted EPS growth will be at normal levels.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike, so we can get your questions.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Thank you, Fran. Jay, we are now ready to take questions for Fran and Matt.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Philip Cusick", "Well that was harsh on for Simon. So first, and thanks for all your help in the last five years and good look going forward and Matt, congratulations on the new seat. How should we think about postpaid phones and accounts going forward given what seems like a saturated industry and reinvigorated competition, are you more in a mode to harvest the existing customers than hunting for more share and accounts?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, thanks Phil I appreciate it. So look, I mean, as we came into the year, we said that one of the top priorities we had was to protect our high quality base and that's what you're seeing. Look, we want to continue to grow from a net subscriber base both in phones, but as I've said before smartphones are going to be a slower growth for the entire industry as it gets more densified. But just a couple things that happened this quarter that did have an impact on our overall growth and really it was more from a gross add basis because as you saw we gave you for the first time our phone churn which is at a 0.90% for the last six consecutive quarters.", "So you can see that we are continuing to maintain that base and protect our base. But of course this quarter, some things happened that affected our inward bound or gross adds. One was, as we previously talked when the competitive world launches new price plans and this quarter was around unlimited and obviously we did not respond to that. But as I've said, there's going to be a two to three-week period of time where there is an impact to our growth and we saw that. But as I've always said, after that three weeks everything kind of normalizes back out.", "So once we got through with that we were off to a really good start with the Samsung Note 7 and then unfortunately there was a total recall of that phone which definitely impacted our growth because historically Verizon has always been the number one leader in high-end Samsung phones, so that certainly impacted us. And then of course we had the Apple launch and as normal everyone is in a backlog situation. So that's just a couple of things.", "The other thing we saw this quarter as well was we are totally focused on smartphones and you saw that our net smartphone growth was 242,000 and that's really where we're focused in on. As you saw also we made some moves in prepaid because where we're losing the subscribers is mostly in the basic phone category and we know that our postpaid pricing is more premium to the marketplace and less attractive to that segment.", "So we did launch some new prepaid pricing and what we did see was, we saw a double amount of our postpaid subscribers move over to our prepaid more than we've seen in history and that accounted for a little less than 50% of our prepaid net adds this quarter. So we did see some shift in our base, but the good news there is, is that we didn't lose the customer. We maintained the customer at least on the Verizon wireless network.", "So going forward as I've always said, we will continue to be very rational in our competitive response. We will respond when we need to. Obviously, we responded on the equipment side of the equation, but as we continue here unlimited is still not something that we're going to move to, but as you saw also we launched new pricing this quarter which we believe also addressed two of the major pain points for our customers.", "One was overage and we saw over 7 million of our customers moved to the new safe mode plans that we constructed which will protect them from getting overage charges in the future. And then second, we also allow them to now carryover if they buy an extra gig the month, if that gig is not totally used we allow them to carry that into the next quarter for usage for 30 days. So we have seen some really positive responses within our base, but obviously there was some impact on the gross adds and some of the competitive environment and we'll go into the fourth quarter very strong. And as I said, we will continue to strive to grow all aspects of our business.", "Philip Cusick", "Thanks Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Jay, we can take Simon now.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Simon Flannery", "Thank you, Mike. And Fran I going to add my best wishes to you and thanks for everything. Just following on, on the topline and the growth question, could you just help us bridge the path to the GDP type growth that you referenced again for 2017 versus the decline of 2.9% normalized for this quarter? some of it I guess is around the service revenue, but you've got to help us with the building blocks and the timing of delivering that. And then I think you were hoping to give us an update on the data center transaction, if you have any news there? Thank you.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Sure, thanks Simon. I'll take the data center and I'll pass the other question on topline over to Matt. On data centers we are proceeding with the sale of our data centers. We are currently in negotiations and we should have something to formally announce to everyone here early in the fourth quarter. So more to come on that, but we are progressing with the sale of our data centers. So Matt?", "Simon Flannery", "So that's with one person, party is it?", "Francis J. Shammo", "At this point, yes we are in negotiations with one individual.", "Simon Flannery", "Okay, thank you.", "Matt Ellis", "Good morning, Simon. So your question about 2017 and where that GDP like topline growth will come from, so let's break it down by the different parts of the business predominately in Wallace as we've said we've been doing this transition. You've seen the year-over-year service revenue trajectory continue to improve. We had negative 6.2% in the first quarter. That came down to 5.4% in the second quarter and 5.2% this quarter. So as we go into 2017 we now have 60% of the base on the non-subsidized pricing. That will continue to expand and that will obviously be a contributor to the improvement in revenue next year.", "And as Fran mentioned earlier, we expect to get back to year-over-year growth by the end of the year in service revenue. We expect to see consistent trends within the wireline business, but remember we only have one quarter of Frontier in the 2016 comparison as we get into 2017. And then as you saw in our comments, we continue to make good progress in IOT and in the video advertising space and we continue to expect those pieces to continue to contribute to the revenue as we head into 2017. So when you add all those things up, we're confident at this point in time that we will be on track to deliver that GDP type topline growth and look forward to giving you more color commentary on that in our January call.", "Simon Flannery", "Great, thanks for the color.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Hey, Jay, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "David? Jay, let's move to the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question is from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik", "Great and Fran again, it's been good working with you for the last five years and good luck in the future.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks John.", "John Hodulik", "Hey with the cable companies announcing that they are going to move forward with the MBNOs mid next year, is there anything you can tell you or about how Verizon sees the economics of those agreements? And obviously given your unique knowledge of the terms what do you think that, what kind of impact do you expect it to have on the sort of overall competitive environment that we're seeing in wireless? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, thanks, John. So look, I mean I'm not going to get into the agreement. Obviously we're under nondisclosure with Comcast on that agreement and the other cable providers, but look, I mean we knew what we entered when we bought the licenses back just several years ago. This is a wholesale agreement and as Lowell and I have repeatedly said, we would do the agreement today again if we had to. I mean, it's a good agreement for Verizon Wireless. It is a good wholesale agreement. I can't speak to the economics of what they're going to do. You have to ask them that question, but look as I've said before, the wireless pie continues to grow.", "Everyone wants to get a piece of this pie. The industry itself will continue to grow around that pie, so it's not like I believe the industry. With the carriers will lose share to anyone. I just think there's going to be more opportunity for growth. If you look at the future and you think about the LTE densification projects that we have going on and then you look at the whole 5G world for fixed wireless. That's going to enter into a whole new growth trajectory for the entire industry.", "So look, again we'll compete against the competition, we'll compete against new entrants in the marketplace, we'll wait to see what's launched. And as I said before, we will respond where we need to respond and we'll wait to see what happens.", "John Hodulik", "Okay, thanks Fran.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Hey, Jay, next question please?", "Operator", "Yes, we have David Barden. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden", "Can you hear me now?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, thank you, David.", "David Barden", "All right, so I dabbled with my mobile phone the first time and again thanks Fran for everything over the past few years. I want to ask few questions if I could, just first on the kind of it sounds like the IOT and AOL ADTECH is that you are going to be part of the kind of revenue equation on a go forward basis. I was wondering if you could talk a little about the margin profile of those relatives to kind of the margin of the kind of general business as we look at it today.", "And then second, specifically on the wireline margin side, obviously we have the new union contract and we're expecting that to kind of have some follow-on benefits into kind of the second half and into next year. Could you talk a little bit about the cadence at which we might see the margin trajectory of the business kind of start to graduate upwards towards the legacy 23% if possible, thanks?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Sure, David, thanks for the questions. I'm going to answer the first one, I'm going to have Matt answer the wireline one. So on IOT, look, I mean we're \u2013 we see the Telematics piece of this to be a really high growth engine for us and as I said in the prepared remarks, we're looking at a 24% without Telogis growth rate year-over-year and mainly most of that is all driven via Telematics and Hum. So we will continue on that. As far as the margin profile goes, look I mean these companies are still maturing. They are profitable, but we expect that the margin profile will continue to grow as we leverage and on to these platforms.", "The other thing too to note that in the IOT world since it is a platform based technology whether you look at IOT or smart cities, these are all very what I would call minimally capital-intensive type businesses and that would go for video as well. So when you think about the return on invested capital, you get there much quicker than say on a network-based type platform. So we're expecting that the ROI on this will happen relatively quickly, but the margin will come and we'll talk more about that as we grow this business. Matt, on Wireline?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, so had a good quarter in Wireline as you saw the EBITDA margin improved to 21.02% so you're starting to see some of that improvement we've been talking about especially as we got out of the impacts from the work stoppage. So as we've said we expect that the new union contract would generate $500 million of cash savings through the term of the contract spread across 2017, 2018, and 2019, so you should certainly see that come through.", "We believe that you will continue to see the wireline margin expand. We had a good expansion in the past quarter and you should see us continue to make progress on that as we go forward into the fourth quarter and then into 2017.", "David Barden", "Great, thanks, Guys.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Okay, Jay, next question?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Michael Rollins", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions and in fact I just wanted to extend my best wishes since you first get upcoming retirement. If I could just follow-on two questions, first if you could talk a little bit about where you are in the testing of the 5G services and what you're learning in terms of the capabilities performance in the economic model and a potential third type into the Hum?", "And then secondly, just going back to the guidance on earnings where you mentioned that you want to get back to normal levels, but given the impact of installment plans and the purchase of the Verizon Wireless minority it's been a few years since I think you could call the changes normal. So how are you defining what normal earnings growth is for Verizon? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks, Michael. I'll take the first pool, I'm going to put the earnings one to Matt. So for the 5G obviously we've been mainly centered around lab testing of 5G we are now moving out into the commercial trial which we're going to span out across several different cities with several different types of testing, with different OEMs. So I wanted to give you an example, one city may be very density going into multidivisional job areas another one might be more urban with just looking at single-family homes. So, we're going to test this in very different types of commercial environments.", "The big issue that still has to be answered quite honestly is the scaling of the technology. So for each small cell how much can each small cell deliver to how many households and still deliver a consistent 1 Gb of speed or some speed that is comparable to a broadband connection to the home. So that still has to be answered and we expect to do gain more knowledge around that in 2017 with the number of commercial trials that we're going to launch. So at this point, that's really all there is just talk about I'm from a 5G perspective. Matt, I'll turn it over to you.", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, good morning, Mike. In terms of the EPS growth for next year and where does she come out, she has stopped topline and we've already talked about how you get to that GDP type growth next year and the changes year-over-year that you should expect to see. And then you're layering in on top of that the continued cost improvements we talked in your layer and I'll talk about the continued cost improvements we talked about in Wallace. Obliviously it started last year with the restructuring of the business. We continue to make good efforts in reducing the cost to run the business whether that's reducing the number of calls we receive, we're reducing the transaction times and moving more of the transactions online, et cetera, ct cetera and you should see more of that continue.", "Wireline, we have the full year benefit of the new union contract coming through. You've seen some of the headcount changes that we talked about that we'll continue to help us expand the margin there. And then in the other parts of the business whether it will be the IOT or the videos we continue to add scale there. The margins there should improve. So when you add those things up you kind of get to an improvement in EPS that we think is in line with what the expectation out on the street should be.", "Michael Rollins", "Thanks very much.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Hey Jay, if we could take the next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.", "Craig Moffett", "Hi, good morning everyone and Fran let me add my thanks and congratulations as well and to you too, Matt. I want to ask about the Yahoo transaction and first if you could just comment on press reports about the finding of a material adverse condition or a change and if you have any update to offer there? But then more broadly with respect to Yahoo and AOL, can you talk about how the proposed rulemaking at the SEC whereby their ISP would likely be held to an opt in standard for adjustability does that change your expectations of how you can monetize either the AOL or the Yahoo asset?", "Francis J. Shammo", "All right, thanks Craig. So on yahoo, look Lowell and Craig have both commented on this recently. So let me just reiterate what they have said. We are still evaluating what it means for this transaction. This was an extremely large breach that has received a lot of attention from a lot of different people. So we have to assume they will have a material impact on Yahoo. Lawyers had their first call yesterday with Yahoo to provide us information but as I understand that's going to be a long process. So unless Yahoo comes up with different process it's going to take some time to evaluate this. So until then we haven't reached any final conclusions around this issue.", "As far as the privacy goes, look I think there's a couple of things here. I mean obviously we take privacy and security of our customers extremely seriously. We live under the regulation of the SEC which has a very high standard for carriers around privacy and what we're looking for is that the FTC and the FCC come out with a common rule that makes it competitive across the entire ecosystem and that the rules are more consistent and so that everyone can compete equally and there's no winners and losers within the ecosystem.", "So we look forward to reviewing the final order of privacy from the FCC and hopefully the FTC and then we'll have to react to that. But look, I mean we're operating AOL today under the current environment and we will continue to operate and as you saw we'll continue to grow AOL under that purview of the privacy regulation. So I think we'll just have to wait to see where this all comes out, but we're hoping that it's an equal playing field across the board.", "Craig Moffett", "Thank you.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Jay, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question is from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking my question and once again Fran congrats and it's been great working with you. So my question is, if I look at your postpaid ARPA the quarter it was actually reasonably stable versus the prior quarter. So I was hoping you could maybe just give us a little more color on what drove that particularly the uptake rate and reaction to the new pricing you put in several weeks ago?", "And then just as an extension of that, if we extrapolate the trend we saw here suggests that maybe you would actually stabilize your service revenues a little sooner than you're talking about and I was wondering what you think the opportunity could be there to maybe get that stabilization a bit faster? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Matt, why don\u2019t you take this one?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, so I think what this one comes back to Brett is and Fran talked about it within the basic the continued growth of our 14 smartphone base we had net adds of 357,014 smartphones during the quarter. That has obviously contributing we saw a very strong adoption from our existing base to the new price plans. We saw a number of those customers step up in terms of the buckets they are purchasing and so I think you see that we have a very strong relationship with our base and our consumers continue to take full advantage of the network.", "We've seen video use or total usage on the wireless network up about 45% this year and you continue to see that show up in the after trend. So yes, as you think about heading into 2017 we expect to see especially as we've got 60% of the base now on the non-subsidize pricing, we expect to continue to see some strong ARPA trends as we go forward into next year.", "Brett Feldman", "Great and actually just one quick followup, you had mentioned earlier that there were some device supply issues, for example the Note 7 and some of the iPhone 7 models recently. Have those cleared up and maybe just as a bigger picture, do you think that over the course of the holiday season you're likely to continue to suffer the supply issues and maybe that could contain some of the upgrades and activity levels we would normally expect?", "Francis J. Shammo", "Well, the Note 7 has been recalled totally and won't be re-launched. So obviously that's a permanent change to the lineup. We're bringing in new phones for the fourth quarter. As always Apple is always generally in a backlog situation for the industry. I don't expect that to change at least not in early in the fourth quarter. But other than that Matt, have you anything else to add?", "Matt Ellis", "No that sounds pretty much it would expect Apple to get caught up as we go through the quarter here and we will see how that plays out.", "Brett Feldman", "Great, thanks for taking the questions.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks Brett.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Okay, Jay, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael McCormack", "Great, thanks and again best of luck Fran and it has been great working with you. On the feature phone base you have north of 13 million phones out there. How should we think about that? Is there going to be an acceleration loss situation or is there something you are doing there either with respect to you are mitigating churn or care or attention efforts if you can comment on that that will be great.", "And then just on the delta between those that are on unsubsidized plans versus those making Edge payments, that gap continues to widen out a bit. Is there retention efforts going on there or is there something else we should be thinking about? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, so I'll have Matt do the feature phone one. Let me just answer the unsubsidized and subsidized Edge phone. So as you know, we have allowed our base to upgrade and choose whether they take a subsidized or an unsubsidized plan. So that currently is the policy that we have and we'll have to review that policy as time goes here into the fourth quarter, first quarter of next year.", "So there may be some shifts within that going forward, but right now that policy still holds and that's why you see some of the separation between the number of people who have moved to the unsubsidized plan versus the number of people who are currently on a device payment plan. So we'll update that in the fourth quarter as we go. Matt, on feature?", "Matt Ellis", "Yes, I think what you're seeing on feature phones is and Fran mentioned this in our earlier remarks that you're seeing some part of the move to prepaid has come from the feature phones. Look, we will have some people who have feature phones in postpaid stay as postpaid customers and we're very happy to glad that they will do that, but we also expect to see some of those continue to move into a prepaid environment which may be a better place for them to be. We also continue to see people moving from feature phones to smartphones and when we get that we see increased usage with those customers as well. So we will continue to monitor that, but we're happy with the trends, where they are going at the moment.", "Michael McCormack", "Great, I look forward to working with you Matt.", "Matt Ellis", "Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Jay, next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.", "Timothy Horan", "Hi and good luck guys. Can we get a little more color on the CapEx its feel and the whole industry seems to be coming at the low end of expectations and I know you focused on this at the end and densification a little bit more. Is this kind of a trend that is sustainable? And related to this, how do you think your network is kind of holding up versus your peers? A lot of your peers are spending a lot less CapEx, but the RootMetrics and other services are saying that their quality is kind of catching up with your network, just any thoughts? Thanks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, thanks Tim. So look, on the CapEx trend, I mean I think this was all related to the strike that we experienced in the second quarter and we're not going to be able to catch up on that from an overall year-over-year perspective. So that's why we've revised the guidance to the lower end of our range. But we're still spending around $17.2 billion this year in CapEx.", "The other thing too is, you have to remember, we're spending our CapEx around wireless for LT densification and as we have talked many, many times before, we do our usage projections well in advance of where we believe that usage will come and obviously we know that video is the major driver of the usage. With a 45% increase year-over-year I think the satnav is over 90% of our data usage is on the LTE network. We see that continuing to increase. So we're really preparing for two years out from where our usage is today.", "So we are densifying the network and we've seen this movie before where CapEx trend goes down and user catches up and then all of a sudden the networks falter. So look, I think the RootMetrics report speak for themselves once again we want hands down across the country. That is the brand that we live by and we will continue to build and densify our networks to meet our customer's demands before they actually realize they need it.", "Timothy Horan", "Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Okay, we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your questions.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thanks very much and once again Fran I wanted to echo prior comments wishing you the best of luck with your next endeavors and congrats now on the new role.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks Amir.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "I was wondering if we could talk more broadly Fran about your M&A strategy, clearly you folks have made concerted efforts improving your asset portfolio to support both the media cover and IOT initiatives. As it stands today, do you see any areas where you may need to bolster your pool of assets in order to move forward with these strategies or as you exit this transition year should we consider 2017 more of an integration here for you folks.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Yes, I think that's right. I mean I think we've made some strategic moves here around diversification. We know that the Telematics business is a business that has high potential and if you looked across the industry there are a lot of competitors in there, but no one really has a big share within that marketplace and we want to gain more share within that marketplace and we think we can with the assets that we've accumulated between Telogis and Fleetmatics here.", "So we'll continue to move in that direction, but I don\u2019t think that there is anything large on the table at this point. We now have to integrate those assets and that's what our Telematics Group is actually doing right now. And as you saw, we launched Hum. Hum came out of the Telematics Group although it is for the majority sold through Verizon Wireless. It actually is a product to come out of the Telematics Group.", "So we will continue to innovate in that area. You're starting to see us do a little few things around smart cities because we believe that with the pre-positioning of 5G and the latency issues smart cities is going to be an area of growth for the future. I mean we have demonstrated with certain cities where we're deploying it now that we can actually save them money on a lot of different things and that their payback is relatively quick. So I think that is just something that we're positioning for the future.", "And then around media Co. obviously we have the Yahoo asset sitting out there, but to date we have accumulated assets that we believe are really strategic for us to grow this business. And as we've said before, we know that the wallet share of consumer for communications has been flat for relatively the last 15 to 20 years. So we have to think about a different way to monetize our network capability and that monetization will come through advertising.", "And it's real simple, I mean, the equation is, if you get more views, you get more advertisers, therefore you generate more revenue. And we see that now with AOL, even with the 10% increase in revenue year-over-year which is the first time we've given that to you, we're starting to see that advertisers are coming to our platforms. So now we just have to integrate and execute on that model and we believe we have the right assets to do that. So the long and short of the answer is, there is nothing large out there that we need to be successful with at this point in time.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you and a quick followup if I may on the mediocre strategy. You know it does seem like increasingly many are attempting to gain share from consumers via video not just some of your peers in the market but on a whole technology company level as well. How do you view your positioning and your ability to do differentiate going foreward? And I guess the question I have is, what have you learned about your strategy thus far be it with AOL Verizon digital media services go90 and how is that informing your strategy going forward in your ability to differentiate?", "Francis J. Shammo", "No, I think the big differentiation here Amir is, we're developing content for short foremen and really for life and that's really the differentiation is short form content whether that's over the top or via mobile. Also I think the differentiation for us is the integration across our platform. So if you go to AOL now you're going to start to see Complex come through. You will see RatedRed and seriously TV in the future come through on that platform. If you look at the NFL we've adopted that into the go90 platform and I know there's been some articles around viewership of NFL. We've actually seen a healthy increase year-over-year on our platform around the NFL.", "So, you know, we are headed in the right direction. The key learnings here have been, you need to have the right content that is appealing to the audience that you're going after and you've seen us make moves. You're going to see us move out of certain content that was originally in go90 that just isn't the right content. But sports news live original content is with the direction that we're taking on this platform and we think we will be successful with that.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thanks very much for taking my questions.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Sure, thanks Amir.", "Michael T. Stefanski", "Thanks for all the questions. So for one last time I have the privilege to turn the call back to Fran.", "Francis J. Shammo", "Thanks Mike. Before we end I want to highlight just a few key points. Number one, we are focused on maintaining leadership in network quality customer loyalty and financial performance. Strategically, we are aggressively building new businesses with revenue streams and ecosystems are expanding the entire industry. I am confident that Verizon will remain a leading player in the next growth phase of the industry and create value for our shareholders.", "Finally, I want to thank the Board, our investors and all of you on this call. It has been a pleasure working with all of you. It has been an honor and privilege to serve as the CFO of Verizon for the last six years. Thank you again for joining Verizon and have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

(NYSE:VZ) Q2 2017 Earnings Call July 27, 2017  8:30 AM ET", "Executives", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Analysts", "Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Verizon second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for questions following the presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Thanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our second quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I'm here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and a transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon's filings with the SEC, which are available on our website. This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides and during our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Matt goes through the results, I'd like to highlight a few items. For the second quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $1.07 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax gain of about $1.8 billion. This net gain consists primarily of the sale of certain data centers to Equinix.", "We also incurred pre-tax severance charges of $607 million and acquisition and integrated related charges of $152 million, primarily in connection with the closing of our acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets, which we previously disclosed. The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $458 million, or $0.11 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.96 in the second quarter, compared to $0.94 a year ago. As a reminder, last year's adjusted earnings per share included $0.07 from the impact of the work stoppage.", "Also, our consolidated results for the second quarter included one month of data center operations that we sold to Equinix on May 1, 2017, and about two weeks of Yahoo operations. We have posted unaudited historical wireline segment results, which recast the segment for the impact of the sale to Equinix on our website.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Matt.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. We had a strong quarter of execution. First, we invested in our 4G network leadership position, resulting in a sweep of third-party network performance surveys for the first half of 2017, while prepositioning for 5G services. Second, we delivered solid wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment with an increase in both postpaid and prepaid accounts. Third, we successfully completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets to scale our media business.", "Network leadership is the central element of our strategy, and we are continually investing in our network to extend our leadership in 4G capacity growth with densification using small cells, which includes expanding our fiber capabilities. As we prepare for the network of the future, we announced the acquisition of Straight Path for $3.1 billion, which we expect will close by the end of first quarter 2018. Straight Path complements our spectrum portfolio and positions us to lead and further drive 5G technology and its ecosystem. We have begun the precommercial fixed wireless trials in eight out of the 11 markets and have our first batch of customers on this technology. As we have previously highlighted, we will have trial results later in the year, and I look forward to sharing them with you.", "We had a strong quarter, adding and retaining wireless customers as the momentum from the launch of our unlimited plans was sustained throughout the quarter. We delivered a strong wireless operational performance that reflects customer demand for our high-quality network in a highly competitive market. Finally, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and immediately began executing on integration plans that we've been working on for over a year. We are confident in the execution of our strategy, which we expect to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows, and return long-term value to our shareholders.", "Let's go deeper into the second quarter operating performance at the consolidated level, followed by wireless and wireline results, media and telematics progress, and network and technology updates.", "Now on to slide 6. In the second quarter, total operating revenue was in line with last year. On a comparable basis, excluding divestitures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined 2.0%. The primary driver was the decrease in wireless service revenue, which was consistent with our expectation. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margin was 37.2%. We remain focused on improving our overall cost structure through operating efficiencies across network, distribution, and care. As we shift more transactions toward a digital model, we can improve the customer experience and further enhance operating efficiencies.", "Let's turn now to cash flows and the balance sheet on slide 7. Our operating segments continue to generate substantial cash flows. During the first half of 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $9.9 billion and included a net after-tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. Our high-quality cash generation is driven by the diverse base of wireless and wireline customers. Our ongoing asset-backed securitization program provided $2.9 billion of cash, which flows through the financing section of the cash flow statement. The impact of the transition to device payment plans and on-balance-sheet securitization should approach a steady state around the end of 2017. Thereafter, the sequential impacts will primarily reflect seasonality of new device launches. As a result, we expect the working capital headwind to subside in 2018.", "For the first half of the year, capital spending was $7.0 billion, which was in line with last year. On a year-to-date basis, our reported free cash flow of $2.9 billion includes the discretionary pension contribution net of tax of $2.1 billion, which flowed through our cash flow from operations. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset-backed securitization, which was introduced in the third quarter of last year.", "Our balance sheet is solid and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business. We ended the quarter with $117.5 billion of total debt, which comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on-balance-sheet securitizations. We have not changed our capital allocation plan or our expectation for cash availability, and we remain focused on having a strong balance sheet with improving credit metrics while continuing to invest in our businesses and returning value to our shareholders.", "Now let's move into reviews of the operating segments, starting with wireless on slide 8. In a highly competitive wireless environment, we delivered a strong operational performance, protecting and expanding our high-valued postpaid customer relationships while balancing profitability. With a clear and comparable offer, our value proposition highlighted the strength of our network, resulting in industry-leading customer retention and improved new demand during the quarter as our offer appealed to customers in underpenetrated segments.", "Wireless operational performance was sustained throughout the second quarter, building on the customer momentum at the end of the first quarter with improvements in both sequential and year-over-year net phone add performance. Net phone additions were 358,000, compared to 86,000 in the prior year. Smartphone net additions were 590,000, versus 336,000 last year. Postpaid net adds totaled 614,000, including tablet net adds of 2,000 and other connected devices of 254,000, led by Verizon Wireless retail home devices. We added 64,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 83,000 last year, and we grew our postpaid account base for the first time in the past six quarters.", "Our postpaid phone churn reflects customer demand for network quality and reliability, while pricing provided choices to meet customer needs. Postpaid phone churn not only continued recent trends below 0.9% but also established a new low in the LTE era at 0.70%. Total retail postpaid churn of 0.94% was consistent year over year and down 21 basis points sequentially. Total postpaid device activations were up 3.0%, of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 5.6%, up from 5.4% year over year, and was 43 basis points higher sequentially. During the quarter, 6.2 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds of 19,000 were up year over year and sequentially due to our stronger value proposition.", "Let's turn to slide 9 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 1.9% in the second quarter as compared to a 5.1% decline in the first quarter. Service revenue declined 6.7% versus a 6.1% decrease in the previous quarter. This trend was primarily due to the lost overage revenue driven by plans introduced during summer of 2016 and the introductory unlimited offer. As we discussed during our last earnings call, we expected weaker year-over-year service revenue through the first half of the year, primarily due to line access and overage revenue trends.", "At the end of the second quarter, about 59% of our accounts have tools that offer customers the ability to self-manage their usage experience. During the second quarter, we experienced an improvement in the rate of decline in line access revenue, as we now have roughly 75% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans. We expect this trend will continue which, combined with adding new accounts and migrating customers to higher access points, will mitigate the lost overage revenue. Therefore, we believe the service revenue trend has flattened, and we expect that there will be an improving trend in the second half, and we should exit the fourth quarter inside a decline of 4.0%.", "In the second quarter, equipment revenue increased 16%. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, as compared to approximately 76% in the first quarter. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the third quarter to be consistent with recent experience. Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had a device payment plan at the end of the quarter. Our wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 45.8%. The movement in the service revenue trend will also positively impact wireless EBITDA margin.", "Let's move next to our wireline segment on slide 10. Total wireline revenue on a reported basis grew 1.2%, including the recently acquired XO operations. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.8% compared to a decline of 3.2% last quarter. This shift in the wireline revenue trend towards fiber is growing. Organically, fiber based products grew more than 3%, which supports our plans to further invest in fiber. Our emphasis on delivering value to all business customers, from the very small to the large enterprise, was recognized recently in a leading third-party study. More importantly, we won the large enterprise business award for the second consecutive year in the same study.", "Consumer markets revenue increased 0.6%, driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue growth of 4.1% was consistent with the past several quarters. During the quarter, we launched Fios Gigabit Connection in certain markets, which offers symmetrical speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second. In Fios Internet, we added 49,000 customers. Fios Video results were pressured due to softer secular demand for traditional linear video, given growth in the over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 15,000 in the quarter. For the second quarter, Enterprise Solutions revenue fell 4.1% on an organic basis, which was due to persistent trends in our legacy products and pricing compression in the marketplace. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 3.5%.", "Partner Solutions revenue declined 6.8% on an organic basis, while the revenue mix towards fiber has been trending higher. Within business markets, fiber revenue is expanding, driven by Fios broadband demand, offset by continued pressure in legacy products. On an organic basis, revenue declined 4.9% and improved slightly sequentially.", "On a comparable basis, the second quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 20.8%, compared to 13.3%, which included the work stoppage, last year. Sequentially, wireline EBITDA margin was down 120 basis points, primarily due to lower revenue from Enterprise Solutions and Partner Solutions and an increase in operating expense as a result of leasing data center space related to the sale to Equinix.", "Let's move next to slide 11 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. On June 13, we completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets. Upon closing, we launched Oath, which is a combination of AOL and Yahoo brands, serving approximately 1 billion unique monthly users globally, and currently represents about $7 billion in annual revenue. We have been planning the integration of AOL and Yahoo for the past year and immediately began executing on integration plans upon closing. We expect to realize over $1 billion in cumulative operating expense synergies through 2020.", "We are in the very early stages of leveraging the scale of the combined assets to distribute and monetize content through programmatic advertising across our Sports, Finance, News, and Entertainment properties. These properties will provide unique advertising opportunities to targeted global audiences. Organically, AOL's revenue net of traffic acquisition costs was consistent with prior year's results in the quarter. As the integration progresses, we will provide additional information on the Oath business. Organically, IoT revenue, including telematics, increased approximately 20% in the second quarter. Telematics revenue was approximately $220 million in the quarter.", "Let's move next to slide 12 to discuss network and technology. We consistently invest in our wireless and wireline assets to ensure that we have capacity, reduce the cost to serve, and to preposition the networks for the future. Our value proposition to our wireless customers is to provide a full network experience including reliability, coverage, and speed. We are on our wireless network plan to deliver the industry's best overall experience for our customers.", "Our network experience continues to be recognized by multiple third-party studies as the industry leader. Since the launch of unlimited, two of these studies have reconfirmed our network leadership in overall performance, including speed and voice quality over LTE. As expected, the introduction of the unlimited pricing plan increased the LTE network usage as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day on the industry-leading wireless network. We are confident in our network and have been engineering the network based on a long-term integrated plan to extend our high-quality experience while expanding our value proposition to customers. We remain focused on delivering increasing capacity over the long-term, utilizing a three-pronged approach: first, network features; second, densification; and, third, spectrum. Let's discuss each of these in detail.", "First, we are methodically deploying LTE Advanced features to increase capacity on our network resources and align with the timing of smartphone introductions that can take advantage of these features.", "Second, small cells are playing a vital role in creating capacity. The densification efforts have been a focal point of our network strategy over the past several years. This density also creates increased spectral efficiency and offers the best wireless experience.", "Finally, with nearly all of our network traffic now on the 4G LTE Advanced network, we are utilizing just over 50% of our low and mid-band spectrum portfolio for this network. We expect to use more of our PCS spectrum for LTE and are just beginning to redeploy 850 megahertz spectrum in certain markets. In addition, we are deploying AWS-3 and will start to add unlicensed spectrum later this year. Our spectrum deployments in conjunction with multicarrier aggregation technology are enabling us to increase network capacity. Our overall wireless network integrates features, densification, and spectrum to enable a step function increase in wireless network capacity over the long term.", "Fiber is a critical element in transforming both wireless and wireline networks to reduce costs and expand future capabilities. To enhance this strategy, our recent announcements to secure fiber demonstrates our commitment to increase our multiuse fiber footprint and build fiber deeper into the network. On the 5G wireless front, we are up and running in eight out of the 11 precommercial fixed wireless broadband trials on the millimeter-wave spectrum. We have the first batch of customers on the network. We will have trial results towards the end of the year that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments.", "Let's move next to slide 13 to review our strategy for future growth. We are executing on our plan to lead in network, preserve and grow our customer relationships, and expand our presence in digital media and telematics to deliver fundamental results while allocating capital to continue to invest in our operations and return value to our shareholders. We delivered strong wireless operational performance and financial results in a competitive environment. We evolved our wireless value proposition while driving profitable growth and reconfirming network leadership based on third-party study results. We expect that we will create incremental capital and operational efficiencies that result in additional cash generation.", "Our 5G strategy is progressing for fixed and mobility use cases, standards, spectrum resources, and fiber investments. Now that we have completed the acquisition of Yahoo's operating assets and introduced the Oath brand, our media business is focused on the integration plans, and we'll look to increase engagement on our platforms. In telematics, we see additional growth opportunities with our Fleetmatics and Telogis assets. We remain confident in our strategy, which puts us in a strong position to compete today and into the future while delivering long-term value to our shareholders.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so we can get to your questions.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Thank you, Matt. Eunice, we're now ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. One moment, please, for the first question. Your first question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research", "Hi, good morning. Two questions if I could. One, I'm curious if you could delve a little bit further into the competitive environment. Last earnings call you provided a perspective of the how net adds and gross adds flowed over the quarter. I was wondering if you could do the same thing just so we could frame what was driving the improvement in your performance this quarter on the phone add out of the equation. And then secondly, just on 5G, if you can give us an update where you are with the trials and maybe if you have an update on the economics that you're seeing from those deployments. Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the question. So on the competitive environment through the quarter, I would say we saw it \u2013 outperformance in the quarter was pretty even. You saw the churn number; we came in at 0.70%. That certainly contributed to the net adds and shows that once we had a comparable offer out there against the competition, I mean, by being unlimited where the other guys are unlimited. Even with the price premium we have, it shows that customers value the high-quality network experience that we deliver, and we saw that throughout the quarter.", "So even as we headed into the back end of the quarter and the competitive environment picked up and some of the other offers that came out there, whether that be large bounties to switch carrier or offering free service, our performance in the back end of the quarter was consistent with where we saw it in the first part of the quarter. So we saw a great result from customers on both the gross adds side and the loyalty side once they had that comparable offer to do. So very excited about how that played out.", "As we head forward, second quarter is typically, seasonally, the low quarter for churn. So while we certainly expect churn to continue to be at low levels, we'll see if we get a normal seasonal uptick as we go forward. But from a competitive environment standpoint, I think we showed that we competed throughout the quarter without having to put any aggressive promotions in place in the market at any time during the quarter.", "In terms of 5G, I think as I said in the prepared remarks, we now have the trials up and running. It's going to be later in the year before we start to see results out of those trials. And then, in terms of the business model and economics that may come of that, it will be driven by the results we see from the trials. So too early right now to be more definitive on that, but we're still confident that we'll have a commercial product in market during 2018 and look forward to providing more details on what's coming out of the trials and the overall economics that we see when we get into the latter part of the year.", "Michael I. Rollins - Citi Research", "Thanks very much.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Okay, thanks, Mike. Eunice, next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Phil Cusick of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys, thanks. First, can we talk about your small cell rollout? Where are we in the path of that? I know it's a multiyear effort, but how far are we into the small cell rollout and densification? And, second, can you talk about the competitive environment in video and broadband? As you add up the OTT trends and traditional video losses, do you see an acceleration in cord cutting, or does it just seem like customers are spreading out among more video service providers? Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, Phil. Good morning. So on the small cell rollout, we're exactly where we planned to be. I mean, our capital plan for the year, we're right on where we planned to be at the start of the year. And we are now \u2013 I would say we have small cell builds in all of the top metro markets at this point, and that's one of the reasons we have the network performance that we've had. We saw confirmation of that as recently as yesterday with another one of the third-party surveys that proves that during the first quarter of 2017, even once we were on unlimited, our network performs better than anybody else's, and that's in large part due to what we've been doing for the past number of years on small cell densification.", "I know you hear a lot of other people talk a lot about small cell densification now. Remember that we've been doing that for a longer time period than anyone else, and that's why we're in all of the top metro markets. And we will continue to do that. That will be a continued part of our network capacity plan. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have the long-term network plan that's based off continuing to deploy the spectrum that we own against the LTE network, densification, and the LTE tools that are available. So densification continues to be a very important part of our network plan.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is there a point, Matt, at -", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "From a competitive environment (28:09) in the broadband and TV space, I think what you saw is we had a continued strong performance on the broadband side, but we also see the ongoing secular trend around video. So we continue to add high-quality broadband customers and will continue to compete on the video side, but certainly we do that in the face of the secular trends that are ongoing.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is there a point, Matt, at which the small cell densification effort sort of starts to slow down in a few years, or is this a constant effort for the next three, five years?", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "I think it continues. It's not just around 4G, as we've talked in the past. As we see 5G being deployed on millimeter-wave spectrum, that's going to require a small cell deployment, and so as we put the densification in place of 4G, we're doing it in mind knowing that we've got the 5G that will be using the same dark fiber in other assets. So the densification activity will continue here for a good number of years.", "Philip A. Cusick - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks, Matt.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Eunice, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. Matt, maybe can we get some more color on a couple of the forward-looking sort of items you gave us on the wireless side? First on the service revenue. It was down 6.7%, but you said that it would start to sort of flatten in the second half. And then the 4% sort of year-end exit run rate. Can I assume we're looking at something around 6.7% for the third quarter and then improvement, something in the sort of 5% range for the fourth quarter? Just if you could put some color there.", "And then some similarly on the margins. You said as the service revenue improves we'd see some improvement in the margins. Total margins in wireless have been down a little bit in the first half, you know in each quarter. Are you sort of suggesting it'll be down less in the second half? Or do you think that as we see the improvement into the year, obviously, there's some crosscurrents with the new phone, but could we get back up flat or even positive comps on the margin? Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, John. So on the service revenue, I think consistent with what we said earlier in the year, we see second quarter as being the low point and the 6.7% for 2Q will become something better then in 3Q. And in my prepared remarks I believe I \u2013 you heard me say that we'll be inside of negative 4% in the fourth quarter. So in terms of how do we get there, we talked about that 75% of the base in second quarter was on unsubsidized pricing. That compares to 53% a year ago. So there's north of a 20-point movement from second quarter last year to second quarter this year.", "As you get into the back half of the year \u2013 I'll use fourth quarter as an example. Fourth quarter year-ago, that number was 67%. This year, that number is going top out in the upper 70s. So we're at 75% now. We'll get up to, let's say, 77%. That will only be a 10-point delta in the fourth quarter year over year. So that pressure that's come from taking customers from the subsidized model down to the unsubsidized pricing is starting to wane, and really the second quarter is where we reached the point, we've got essentially the vast majority of the consumer base now on unsubsidized pricing.", "And then overage revenues also being, obviously, part of the story here over the past few quarters, first with the introduction of the price plans last year that had the Safety Mode feature and then bringing on unlimited. As we said, we now have 59% of accounts on one of those two plans. Overage was actually down 34% in the second quarter on a year-over-year basis. Now represents a low single digit percentage part of total service revenues. So we're working through that headwind. We'll work through that headwind a lot faster. And so, as I say, based off that, I am very confident we'll be inside negative 4% in fourth quarter, and by the time we get on this call a year from now and our comparison is against this year being 75% on unsubsidized pricing, we'll be having a very different conversation about the service revenue trajectory next year.", "And then on margin improvement, as you know, service revenue is the highest margin component of our business, so as the trajectory on service revenue improves, the trajectory on margin will improve as well.", "John C. Hodulik - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Matt.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Eunice, next question, please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, guys, thanks a lot. I guess two if I could. I just wanted to follow up on that service revenue question, Matt. I mean, the math kind of suggests that by fourth quarter your service revenue will actually be growing from where it is in the second quarter. And I wonder if you could kind of talk about the inputs to that expectation in terms of kind of what you expect from a competitive pricing environment, promotions with the iPhone, et cetera, relative to that mix shift that you've been talking about, as you kind of go past the price down cohort and you move into this group of people that are kind of more pricing up. If you could talk about those two dynamics as kind of the inputs as your base case, would be helpful.", "And then the second question, if I could, would be on the media segment. I mean, if you could kind of elaborate a little bit more on what is that thing growing at today and what will it look like in the future? I guess we've talked about maybe turning down the search business and how that business might transform over the next six months or year, would kind of be helpful to kind of understand what that unit is going to look like. Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah, good morning, David. Thank you. So the inputs to service revenue. Really as you think about that trajectory changing, when you've got growing accounts, growing net adds, when you see the continued improvement in the delta on the non-subsidized pricing and as we work through the overage, all of that will combine to a much stronger trend as we go forward from where we have been.", "In terms of the impact of any new devices coming along, look, we assume that we'll see something later in the year. We typically have very strong results when we have new devices come out because when customers get a new device with new functions, they want it on the best network, but we'll see what happens there. And certainly would expect that to be accretive to the overall revenue story.", "But our guidance for the year doesn't require any major uplift as a result of that. And then the media side, look, I will say it was very early in the process of integrating those two businesses. As we said, the revenue of AOL less TAC was flat year over year in the quarter. Tim and the team are just getting started integrating those two businesses. They're about 45 days in at this point. The integration is going well, and I look forward to being able to provide more color and commentary about exactly what they're seeing as they go forward. But as you heard Tim say a couple of months ago, the goal here is to grow this to north of $10 billion in revenue by 2020, and nothing that's happened since we closed has changed our view on that.", "David Barden - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks, Matt.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Eunice, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. A question for Matt. And if I'm reading your guidance correctly, it seems like you effectively reiterated your outlook for the year, including what implies roughly a flattish EPS trend. There were a few moving parts this quarter. You did the Equinix data enter deal, and I think that may have been slightly dilutive to earnings. And, of course, you completed the acquisition of Yahoo. So I was hoping maybe you could just unpack your outlook for the full year and maybe let us know the extent to which those transactions may have been accretive or dilutive to your trends for the balance of 2017. Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, Brett. So the guide, if you look at the language on the revenue side, we said we'd be reasonably consistent on an organic basis. So as we think about that, we would remove out anything that wasn't in the business for all of 2016-2017. So certainly the impact of those businesses have been having about $0.02 a quarter on EPS, so when I think about the guide going forward, it's on an organic basis. Still feel very confident organically we'll be in a consistent place to where we were a year ago, and then we'll bake in the impact of the various acquisitions as we go forward.", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So does that imply that it's actually additive to your full-year outlook? (37:25)", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "As we get into each of those businesses, certainly from a revenue standpoint they are additive to the outlook. From an earnings standpoint, some of those businesses have an initial pressure as we integrate them, but not material to the earnings outlook.", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then just a different question. As we think about unlimited, and you were talking about doing more digital customer interactions and customer care, have you already started to see a benefit there? In other words, as your customer base has moved to unlimited plans, is that cohort contacting you less frequently? And could this be a real area of offset to some of the overage that you're losing on the top line?", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah, absolutely. I mean, certainly with customers on unlimited they have fewer reasons to call. But we continue to want to improve the customer experience, and when customers can do things by themselves through a digital channel at the time they want to do it, that increases overall satisfaction, and it certainly allows us to improve the efficiency of the business. So we're continuing to do that, and we think unlimited certainly helps us do that as well.", "Brett Feldman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Eunice, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.", "Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Hi, thank you. Matt, I wonder if we could return to the network densification conversation you had a few moments ago. Can you talk about how you think about the trade-off specifically between acquiring more spectrum and network densification, and from an economics perspective, and has that shifted at all inside of Verizon? I mean, my sense is you're much different than a year or so ago. You spend less time talking about new spectrum acquisition. Is that a fair characterization?", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Look, we continue to look at that trade-off. It really comes down to taking a view on the most efficient way to add the capacity that we need, and we've talked for two or three years now about the fact that we believe based off of the valuations that spectrum have reached in some places, it's more efficient to densify. And certainly the costs of densification, just like with any technology, have come down to some degree since we started densifying with small cell. So the overall analysis we do hasn't fundamentally changed. Look, we continue to add spectrum from the secondary markets, too. So when spectrum is priced at the right level, we continue to be active in that space, too. And we just look at the relative economics between densifying and adding spectrum. But densification has proved to be a very effective way of adding capacity into what places we need to and from a cost efficiency standpoint as well.", "Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thanks, Matt, and if I could just ask a quick follow-up. I'm going to risk putting words in your mouth, but is it fair to say that you still believe, broadly speaking, that network advantage is still possible and within reach for Verizon with the network densification strategy?", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Look, I think the results speak for themselves on this one, Craig, and whether it be the third-party results that you've seen, again, just in the last 24 hours. But even in an unlimited world, the third-party results clearly show that Verizon has the best network. And then when you look at our subscriber metrics for the quarter, once we were on a comparable basis, we saw record low churn down 0.70%, and we also saw a strong net add number. So the idea that network differentiation doesn't matter to customers \u2013 quite frankly, the results from our base show that that's not true and customers do value the benefit of a differentiated network experience even when it's at a premium pricing, which is where ours is. We wouldn't get those results if a better network experience didn't matter to customers. Clearly it does.", "Craig Eder Moffett - MoffettNathanson LLC", "Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Eunice, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "Hey, guys, thanks. Matt, maybe just a little deeper on the churn that we saw in the quarter \u2013 obviously a very strong result there. Is it an impact from more EIP customers and sort of the equipment balances keeping people steady? Was there anything you guys were doing with respect to protecting the base with maybe proactively moving to unsubsidized without the EIP payments? And then just following up again on the guide on service revenue, what's the more important driver here for the year? Is it handset additions maintaining sort of a positive posture, or is it the ARPA starting to turn? Or, obviously, it could be a combination of both.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, Mike. So on the churn, look, there's no magic in here. It's not that we've got more customers on EIP or we've been doing things behind the scenes to protect the base. It's around the quality of the experience. And customers see that quality of the experience, and they want to be on that experience rather than something else. So we're very, very happy with that number there, and it's just a reflection of what we give customers.", "In terms of the guide on service revenue, I think the biggest piece that you have in there is the continued migration of the base to the non-subsidized pricing plans. In the back half of the year, the year-over-year comps are against higher numbers there versus the first half of the year, and that's going to drive improvement in service revenue. Certainly net account growth is an important contribution, but I think just, though, the movement of the base and in unsubsidized, that's the trend we've been talking about, and we certainly see that ahead of us.", "Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "And, Matt, maybe just a quick follow-up on thoughts on towers. I know one of your \u2013 your biggest competitor, I guess, is looking for alternatives. Are you guys also evaluating some of those things?", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "We continue to look at all ways to manage the network at the most efficient pricing that we have, whether that be how we talk to towers or all the other resources we have in front of us.", "Michael L. McCormack - Jefferies LLC", "Great, thanks, Matt.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Eunice, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsche of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer M. Fritzsche - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you for taking the question. Matt, if I may, on the spectrum side, I know you've talked much about densification, but you did mention other spectrum sources. It looks like there's going to be a 3.5 gigahertz auction possibly next year. And it seems like Verizon's done much lobbying for that effort. In your spectrum kind of wish list, is it fair to say you're probably more focused on higher-band spectrum at this point? Or if you could comment on that.", "And then second, if I may, on the One Fiber initiative, it's certainly early to call 2018 CapEx, but do you still feel comfortable that, with the fiber plans you've laid out, or some which we know about, some we probably don't, that that really won't be a huge increase in the CapEx lever next year? Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Thanks, Jennifer. So on the spectrum wish list, look, we're very confident in the portfolio of spectrum that we have, certainly in low band and mid-band, and we have a significant amount of spectrum still to deploy against the LTE network. We'd certainly be interested in the 3.5 [gigahertz] and look forward to that coming forward, but as I say, we're very confident in the spectrum that we still have to deploy.", "From a CapEx standpoint next year, look, it's too early to get into the guide next year, but as we think about how we deploy fiber and so on, that will be part of the plans, and we'll share those as we get towards the latter part of the year and certainly into January, when we provide the full-year guide.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Okay. Jennifer, thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks a lot. Good morning. Matt, you talked a little bit about some of the pressures in the video business from over-the-top. How is Verizon thinking about that opportunity? Is there a case for you to have your own over-the-top product to compete? And how do you think \u2013 I know on convergence you've typically been conservative, but we're seeing a lot more of these converged wireless plus over-the-top offerings. And maybe just touching, then, on M&A and what your interest is in potentially owning more content to have some exclusive product for your customers. Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Thanks for the question, Simon. So on over-the-top, look, nothing to say. We're always looking, but we'll continue to evaluate what we need to do to be competitive in that space and if it needs to be part of the portfolio or not. From a convergence standpoint, again, we're very comfortable with the product offerings we have today, and if there is more convergence, we certainly believe that will take place on our networks, and we'll be effective as being part of that.", "And then from an M&A standpoint, look, we're very comfortable with the assets we have today. If there's an opportunity to add something that accelerates the strategy at a reasonable price, we will. But we think we have the assets we need to be effective at this point in time.", "Simon Flannery - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Eunice, next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you very much. I was wondering if we could touch upon sort of that network focus and the most efficient means to build additional capacity. When we think about your fiber footprint, you folks have certainly augmented it via acquisitions as well as some of the announcements that you've made to build out capacity. Where does it stand at this juncture in terms of not just the fiber footprint itself, but having the right type of fiber assets to deploy 5G? And how do you expect to augment that capacity going forward?", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah, thank you. So as we think about the fiber we need for the business, certainly we need more going forward, as we've discussed in the past. The way that we're going to add that capacity will be probably through a combination of buying fiber that already exists if it's the right type of fiber. We can build fiber, and we can certainly lease. And we were doing that on top of some of the assets we already own, and add in the XO, those fiber metro rings earlier in the year gives us the base on which we will continue to do some of that. So fiber will continue to be very important the higher we build the network, not just for wireless but also various wireline applications, including Smart City deployments. So more to come there as we go forward.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That's very helpful, Matt. And then just dovetailing on the prior commentary on over-the-top, just want to try and put those comments that you had made in terms of evaluating options with some of the comments that seem to have been made previously about you folks putting together an offering. I mean, has that changed in terms of timing or what your strategy is for over-the-top?", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "I'd say there's no change to our strategy at this point in time.", "Amir Rozwadowski - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Excellent. Thanks very much for the incremental color.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Great. Eunice, we'll take one more question, please, and then we'll wrap up.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Great, guys, and thanks, guys, and congratulations on a good quarter. Matt, the unlimited side, and incredible impact here, do you think this is sustainable? Are you seeing any slowdown at all? Maybe \u2013 I'm not sure if you said on the call \u2013 what percentage of your base are on unlimited or maybe a flow share.", "And then not to pound you on wireless margins, but it sounded like you kind of expect them to trend up for the next several years, not just for this quarter. Do you think we can get back to, on a consolidated basis, the type of margins we saw last year or even better than that? And I guess just lastly how do you balance out the growth in subscribers with the margins that you're generating which are still, obviously, industry-leading? Thanks.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Yeah. Thanks, Tim. So, look, I absolutely think the trend on unlimited is sustainable. Once we gave customers that clear and comparable offer, we see the value of our network and our offering compared to what else is in the marketplace. And, look, we'll see how the marketplace evolves going forward. But we're very confident that we will be competitive as that happens.", "From a margin improvement standpoint, look, as service revenue trends improve, we would expect that to flow through into margins. And then also we continue to have ways to take cost out of the business and improve efficiencies in the business, too. So you should think about that as you think about how we go forward in the wireless performance.", "Timothy Horan - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Michael T. Stefanski - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Okay, great. And with that, I'd like to just turn the call back over to Matt on this busy earning morning.", "Matthew D. Ellis - Verizon Communications, Inc.", "Thanks, Mike. I'd like to close the call with a few key points. We remain confident in our strategy of investing in our networks while maintaining and expanding our high-quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well-positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry in the 5G ecosystem with our strong network assets. We have the opportunity to do the things at scale while delivering value across our portfolio in order to generate shareholder value. We look forward to the opportunities ahead of us and are confident in our ability to execute our strategy.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Michael Stefanski, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks, Eunice. Good morning, and welcome to our third quarter earnings conference call. This is Mike Stefanski, and I\u2019m here with Matt Ellis, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Brady Connor, who will be assuming my role as the Head of Investor Relations later in the fourth quarter.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on our Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before I get started, I would like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are available on our website.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "Before Matt goes through the results, I would like to highlight a few items. For the third quarter of 2017, we reported earnings of $0.89 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include a few special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss of about $620 million, primarily associated with early debt redemption costs of $454 million and acquisition and integration related charges of $166 million retaining to Yahoo and other acquisitions.", "The net impact of these items after tax was approximately $374 million, or $0.09 per share. Excluding the effect of these special items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.98 in the third quarter, compared to $1.01 a year ago. Included in our EPS is a $0.01 impact due to the natural disasters in Texas and Florida during the quarter.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Matt.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks, Mike. Good morning to everyone on the call, and thank you for joining us today. Let me by start by reviewing the progress on our strategic initiatives before getting into detailed results. The cornerstone of our strategy is to provide our customers with the best network experience available. We are steadily investing to advance our 4G LTE leadership and actively building the network of the future.", "Our network performance leadership was evidenced by a sweep of third-party surveys for the first half of 2017 and a network's resiliency during the recent hurricanes and wildfires. We delivered solid operational and financial performance in a competitive environment. We grew our retail postpaid and prepaid wireless bases with new unlimited data options and maintain strong customer retention.", "Service revenue trajectory also improved as expected. Our wireline results were consistent with the past quarters despite ongoing consumer video headwinds throughout the industry. Demand for a high quality fiber based products remains strong. Our Oath team's integration of AOL and Yahoo is ahead of our internal expectation.", "We are confident in the execution of our strategy to drive profitable growth, generate strong cash flows and produce long-term value for our shareholders. The board of directors demonstrated our commitment to return value to our shareholders when they declared the 11th consecutive annual dividend increase last month.", "We will start by reviewing the third quarter segment operation performance, followed by a progress update on our new businesses, a walkthrough of consolidated results and finally network and technology updates.", "Now onto the wireless segment on Slide 5. Our wireless business delivered another strong quarter of operational performance in a highly competitive environment. We grew and retained high value postpaid customer relationships profitably. In August, we expanded our postpaid unlimited data plan to include a lower price access entry points, which provides consumers with more choices to experience the leading 4G LTE network with confidence in our networks we are now addressing a larger market with Unlimited.", "Given our clear and comparable service value proposition, momentum continued in the quarter. Smartphone net adds were 486,000 versus 242,000 last year. Total postpaid net additions were 603,000 included [four] (Ph) net adds of 274,000, 91,000 tablets and 238,000 other connected devices led by wearables. We added 30,000 postpaid accounts versus a loss of 107,000 last year.", "Total retail postpaid churn was 0.97% for the third quarter which improved by seven basis points year-over-year. postpaid's phone churn was 0.75% and was the main driver of the improvement in total postpaid churn. Postpaid device activations were nearly 9.8 million of which 82% were phones. Our retail postpaid upgrade rates was 5.5%.", "During the quarter, 6.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans. Prepaid net adds were 139,000 for the quarter with an increased focus on the smartphone value proposition. Additionally, we have recently expanded our offering to allow families the flexibility to combine different prepaid plans at a great value.", "Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at wireless revenue and profitability. Total wireless operating revenue declined 2.4% in third quarter as compared to a 3.9% decline a year ago. On a year-over-year basis, service revenue declined 5.1% versus a 6.7% decrease in the previous quarter. sequentially service revenue increased for the first time in 12 quarters.", "The key drivers of overall improvement in service revenue include increased access revenue through customer migration to higher access points. New account formation and the tail end of the transition of customers to unsubsidized pricing. We now have approximately 78% of the postpaid phone base on unsubsidized plans as compared to 60% a year ago. We expect the service revenue trends to continue to improve in the fourth quarter and to exit the year with a decline of less than 4% year-over-year.", "In the third quarter, equipment revenue increased 5.5% due to a higher device payment plan take rate. The percentage of phone activations on device payment plans was about 77% in the quarter, which is consistent with the prior period. We expect the take rate for device payment plans for the fourth third quarter to increase seasonally due to heightened consumer equipment activity.", "Approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance at the end of the quarter. Wireless EBITDA margin as a percent of total revenue was 46.2%, up slightly sequentially and up from 44.9% a year ago. In the fourth quarter, we expect the improvement in service revenue to flow through wireless EBITDA margin partially offsetting pressures in highest seasonal volume, advertising expenses and promotional activity.", "Let\u2019s move next to our wireline segment on Slide 7. Total reported wireline revenue grew 1.1% including XO operations and data center divestitures. On an organic basis, wireline segment revenue decreased 2.7%, which was consistent with the prior quarter. Our fiber offerings continue to gain share and grow revenue partially offset in a decline in legacy copper products.", "Consumer markets revenue increased 0.9% driven by Fios Internet activity. Consumer Fios revenue grew 4.6% including the impacted two markey Pay Per View events during the quarter. Verizon was recognized by a leading third-party study as the top rated residential internet provider for customer satisfaction in the Fios footprint.", "Fios Gigabit Connection, which launched earlier this year continues to gain traction offers symmetrical speed of up to one gigabit per second. We added 66,000 Fios Internet Customers in the quarter. Fios Video results were pressured due to the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings, as well as competitive promotional activity. Fios Video losses were 18,000 in the quarter.", "Enterprise Solutions revenue excluding XO, decreased 5.0%, while growth in fiber based products continues. On a constant-currency basis, revenue was down 5.3%. Partner Solutions revenue declined 3.9% on an organic basis, which is an improvement over prior period. Within business markets, fiber revenue is increasing, driven by demand for Fios broadband products.", "On an organic basis, total revenue declined 5.8% year-over-year. On a comparable basis, the third quarter wireline EBITDA margin was 21.1%, compared to 20.3% a year ago and up 40 basis points sequentially driven by ongoing costs control measures.", "Let\u2019s move next to Slide 8 to discuss our progress in new businesses, starting with media. During the quarter, our Oath team has been executing on more than 20 integration work streams. We are positioning the business for the future, locking in early synergies and setting out a roadmap for the next several years with the expectations to realize $1 billion in operating expense synergies through 2020.", "With the addition of Oath, Verizon's addressable market has expanded from millions of wireless and wireline customers to about one billion global content consumers. We are combining the best aspects of AOL and Yahoo to create a uniform and integrated platform to drive engagement and consumer value.", "Oath revenue is $2 billion for the quarter, we will provide additional information on Oath in future quarters as we progress through the integration phase. Telematics revenue was over $220 million in the quarter including Fleetmatics and Telogis. Total IoT revenue on an organic basis increased approximately 13% in the quarter.", "Let's move next to Slide 9 to wrap up with our consolidated results for the quarter. The solid segment results in the quarter and addition of new businesses drove improvements in the consolidated top-line reported results. In the third quarter, total operating revenues were higher by 2.5% on a reported basis. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and acquisitions, consolidated revenue declined to 2.3%.", "Similar to recent quarters, the primary driver was the year-over-year decrease in wireless service revenue. On a consolidated basis, excluding special items, adjusted EBITDA margins was 36.7% up slightly from prior year's margin of 36.5%. We are focused on driving profitability through cost and capital efficiencies across our business. As Lowell announced in September, we have targeted $10 billion in cumulative cash savings over the next four years.", "Let's turn now to cash flows in the balance sheet on the Slide 10. We had a strong quarter of cash generation supporting our consistent capital allocation program and returning value to shareholders. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was $17.2 billion including working capital pressure primarily due to the $3.7 billion of device payment plan receivables.", "Year-to-date capital expenditures were $11.3 billion with the sequential with a sequential increases in the quarter driven by increased spending in wireless, supporting growing network demand, while prepositioning for 5G. We expect full-year 2017 capital expenditures to be at the lower end of the guided range of $16.8 billion to $17.5 billion.", "Free cash flow from the first nine months of the year totaled $5.9 billion, which included a net after tax discretionary pension contribution of $2.1 billion. In addition, our free cash flow does not include proceeds from asset backed securitization which we initiated in the third quarter of last year.", "we did not executing an asset back securitization during the third quarter, but have generated $2.9 billion year-to-date from our ABS borrowings. Over the last few days, we completed our third public ABS transaction this year to $1.4 billion.", "The impact of device payment plans and on balance sheet securitization is expected to approach a steady state by year-end, reducing working capital headwinds during 2018. We anticipate working capital fluctuations throughout the year due to seasonality in wireless equipment volumes.", "We ended the quarter with the $117.5 billion of total debt, comprised of $109.6 billion of unsecured debt and $7.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our near term unsecured maturities are modest at $2.3 billion through 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility to grow the business.", "Let\u2019s move next to Slide 11 to discuss our network and technology. Our industry leading wireless and wireline networks are the cornerstone of our strategy and we consistently invest to ensure that we have capacity to serve growing demand technology to reduce the cost of serve and a network position to lead the industry into the future. We continue to win awards in third-party studies, a test to combination of coverage, speed and reliability.", "Based on the confidence in our network, we broaden to unlimited options to offer more customers and unmatched unlimited experience on the best wireless network. As expected, the introduction of unlimited pricing plans has increased the LTE network usage across various busy timeframes and geographies as our customers enjoy the experience of consuming more data throughout the day.", "We are more affectively utilizing existing network capabilities and service plan features to handle the increased traffic without interrupt in the quality of the customer experience. Just over 50% of our available low and mid-band spectrum portfolio is being used 4G LTE.", "Network reliability and resiliency are critical elements to our wireless network, we are thankful and proud of the work performed by our employees during the tragic natural disasters in Texas, Florida and Northern California, who ensured they are first responder and all of those effect who were able to relay on our network in the time of need. We maintained a high level of performance through our planning, network redundancy and rapid response despite wide spread power outages.", "Although, we are not a wireless network operate in Puerto Rico, we have offered assistance to the local carriers and government officials as they work to recover from unprecedented hurricane damage. We are steadily investing in the network of the future, which we called a Verizon Intelligent Edge Network.", "This network has many components the lead to a multi-use software driven network upscale. It goes from the wireless or wireline access networks to intelligent distributed computing platform to a highly automated software enabled core network. This architecture enable by a dense flexible radio network with deep multi-used fiber that we have been building for years.", "As we seen new use cases, this Intelligent Edge Network architecture will meet the new types of application demand. We will leverage these in [HART] (Ph) network capability such as latency, throughput and security to create network slices that will be tuned to the specific needs of each application.", "Our pre-commercial 5G fixed wireless broadband trials are continuing, live customer experiences on the network provide key data and learnings that will give us valuable insights for commercial deployments. We are on-track to share trial results later in the fourth quarter. Over the past several years, we have been leading the development of 5G industry standards and the ecosystems are fixed in mobile. Global development is accelerating based on our work alongside industry partners for multiple used cases.", "Let\u2019s move next to Slide 12 to review our strategy for future growth. We are confident in our strategy to drive future growth while delivering near-term results. We are laying the foundation for the network of the future, while maintaining a strong lead in 4G LTE coverage, capacity and reliability. Our focus is on preserving and growing our customer relationships, while expanding our presence in digital media and Telematics.", "The execution model is to deliver strong fundamental results, allocate capital to our networks, maintain a strong balance sheet and return value to our shareholders. Our wireless value proposition is evolved to allow more customers to experience unlimited wireless plans on the best U.S. networks. We produce solid operational and financial performance across the business in a competitive environment while investing in our best-in-class networks and driving near-term cost efficiencies.", "Our long-term strategy is to change people's lives by delivering the promise of the digital world while leading the industry and innovate for future technological application. 5G provides a path for growth with fixed and mobility use cases with 4G interoperability. The 5G ecosystem is progressing with [standards] (Ph) and technology development and we are prepositioning our network with fiber investments, spectrum resources and cloud architecture.", "With that, I will turn the call back to Mike so that we can get to your questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you Matt. Eunice, we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery", "Great, thank you very much. Good morning. Matt, you mentioned the $10 billion cost reduction program. Could you just give us a little bit more color around some of the buckets on that and how should that layer through the next four years. and then on Unlimited, any updated stats on what percent of your base or what percent of your new customers are taking that plan and obviously since you changed it to the two or the three plans who's taking the lower rate plan versus the higher is that splitting more towards the higher ARPU plans. Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks Simon and good morning. So on your first question around the $10 billion books, Lowell announced that last month, since then we have put a dedicated team against that and we are starting to get around that work. It's a little early to get into some of the specifics of the timing of when you should see that, but in terms of bucket that's going to come across.", "Really think about all of the all parts of the business are in focus here, whether that\u2019s the network, whether that be distribution and care and even to obviously the shared service parts of our business and across the complete supply chain.", "We are going to take a deep look across the whole business and identify areas where we have the opportunities to significantly improve the efficiency on how we operate the business. As we get further into that program, we will share more specifics overtime both on where the savings are going to be realized from and also the expected timing, but I think we are off to a good start with it.", "In terms of your second question around Unlimited and the new price plans. I would tell you that between Unlimited and the Verizon 2.0 that we introduced last summer, we now have approximately two-thirds of the base on planned where they could control their over expense. And so that's up as you would expected from where we were a quarter ago and that's obviously a significant part of the base now has the ability to do that.", "The mix is as expected between the two plans, we are not going to go into the specifics of each of those. I would tell you though that in the third quarter what was - we saw as we expected the migration of existing customers from data bucket plans to Unlimited plans shifted to where on average they were stepping up in revenue from their bill prior.", "And as we expected, we knew that initially we would see optimizes who had the opportunity to move to Unlimited and save money, we saw that in this first quarter as we introduced those plans. In the second quarter, we continue to move through that by the end of the quarter essentially that was flat that customer\u2019s migrated over. And then in the third quarter, we got to the point where the customers migrating over actually increasing and you saw the increase in [indiscernible] sequentially from 2Q to 3Q for the first time in three years. So we are seeing good progress there.", "Simon Flannery", "Great. Just one quick follow-up. Any impact then on 2018 or is it really going to be ramping through 2018, so the impact is more 2019, 2020 from the 10 billion.", "Matthew Ellis", "You will see some impact in 2018, but it\u2019s a cumulative number over those four years, but absolutely, we will see benefit in 2018.", "Michael Stefanski", "Simon, thank you. Next question Eunice.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "John Hodulik", "Great. Matt, couple of questions on the wireless sort of the growth and profitability. First on the upgrade, saw a low number in the third quarter. As you guys look after the fourth quarter do you think that changes and maybe bounces back a little bit, like maybe won\u2019t see as much seasonality you typically do, we are basically trying to get a sense whether it\u2019s sort of a lack change in the technology or just customer at this point waiting for their turn to come out?", "And then related to Simon\u2019s questions, you saw sequential growth in service revenue for the first time in a while this quarter and it sounds like these trends are sort of inflecting. So could you guys return to sort of year-over-year growth sooner than the third quarter next year given those underlying trend you are seeing in ARPU? And related to your comments about margins, does that mean that we might not see the typical downdraft in margins, we typically do in the fourth quarter given the flow through effects that you mentioned?", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, thanks John. So as you mentioned the upgrade rate in the third quarter was a little lower than we have seen in past years. I think what you are seeing there is difference in timing of some of the new devices coming out versus what we have historically seen. Obviously Apple is part of that with splitting the new devices between the eight, which came out in 3Q and the ten which comes out in 4Q.", "But also on the Android OS side of the house with having the new Google device coming out this month as well. I think you are going to see more of \u2013 we would expect to see a shift is some of the volumes versus typically from 3Q to 4Q. So look as we get into the holiday season some of those new devices come out, we think, we will see strong demand and look if you are paying a $1000 for a new handset you are going to walk not to be on a good network. So we are very confident that we will get more than our fair share of that activity when it comes through in the fourth quarter, but obviously, we will wait to see exactly how that plays out.", "In terms of the sequential revenue trends and as you highlighted, we were up in service revenue from 2Q to 3Q. That was in-line with our expectations as we discussed on the last call. As you start to see combination a number of factors. We have largely migrated the consumer base to unsubsidized pricing, it was 78% in 3Q, 75% in 2Q. So that transition is largely done and so you are no longer seeing as much of a headwind from the reduction in the line access fee. And as I mentioned, we are starting to see step up and migrate is over.", "In addition to that, we increased the number of accounts for the second quarter in a row, so you got the total volume in the business up as the rate we are getting from customers going up too. So as I said in the script, we expect to be inside of 4% on a year-over-year basis in the fourth quarter, and as I have said previously, I expect that we will get to service revenue growth during 2018.", "In terms of your questions around margins, it's a little too soon to say where they will play out in the fourth quarter. Obviously as we are now on unsubsidized, we don't have the same subsidy headwind, but we will see what the environment is like in the fourth quarter competitively and we will respond as necessary. So we will see where that shakes out between now and the end of the year.", "John Hodulik", "Great, thanks Matt.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks John. Eunice, next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you can maybe unpack the improvement you continue to see in postpaid churn, particularly phone churn. You obviously have a much better visibility into your customer base and than we do. So for example, to what extend do you think that this is a structural improvement in churn as a result of customers moving into Unlimited plans and other plans where they can control their overage. To what extent do you think it might just be that the seasonal pattern of device launches has been moved a bit and so it could see it moved back to prior levels as we go through that cycle.", "And then just as an extension of this question of this question. Some of your competitors have been looking to lower churn by including free or just deeply discounted streaming video products as part of their bundles. I'm curious whether that's something that you think would make sense for Verizon as well. Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks Brett. Look I would say as I look at the churn number, we have always had a good churn number, it's obviously 0.75 continues to trend that we saw in the second quarter and really continues the trend since we saw mid February when we launched Unlimited. And as we said at the time, the key driver of launching Unlimited was to protect our pace of customer which we think is the best and most valuable set of customers in the industry.", "So look there is a number of things that go into that, but I would tell one of the biggest thesis is the network experience that Verizon customers have, they get to see that they understand the reality of our network experience versus some of the others and so we saw that with some of the recent natural disasters that customers on our network understands that when things really matter Verizon is a network they want to be on. So that continues to be key part of it and I believe we can continue to have very good churn without necessarily the bundle in other aspect into the core offering.", "Brett Feldman", "Is it fair to say that you would expect on a seasonal basis going forward. So for example, this fourth quarter you still think you might do better than you did a year ago even if there is an uptick in devices and maybe industry wide churn.", "Matthew Ellis", "You mean to better year-over-year [indiscernible] number?", "Brett Feldman", "Yes.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, I think look we have seen that since we launched Unlimited and we had a clear and comparable offer in the marketplace. We have demonstrated that our customers prefer being on Verizon rather than moving somewhere else and I have no reason to believe that will change in the fourth quarter as we go forward. So very confident that we will see that trend continue.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking the questions.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thanks Brett. Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Barden", "Hey, guys. Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just a couple. First, Matt, you kind of highlighted the impact of divestitures and acquisitions on the revenue line which was about a 5% swing versus the reported numbers. Could you maybe walk that down through EBITDA and then to earnings with respect to all the different moving parts year-over-year?", "And then second, Lowell was pretty widely reported as talking about working on a content type of program or partnership or acquisition as you worked into the back part of the year. Could you elaborate a little bit more on kind of what the goal is for that project and maybe how it ties to your plans for launching your own over-the-top video products? Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, so I will start with the second one there. So with respect to Lowell\u2019s comment around content and potential deal for usage rights. I would say, we are continuing to work that particular transaction Lowell, when he made that common expected it would be done by now. Unfortunately it just taken a little longer to [indiscernible] fully expect to see something there as we move forward.", "In terms of the over the top, really nothing new to add versus what Lowell said last month. Look this is a space what we think there is an opportunity for us to play, we think that makes sense for us to play in that space, but we don\u2019t want to launch just a me too type product. So we are continuing to look at what makes sense for us to launch something that\u2019s differentiated in that space, probably around live programming, but how and when we launch something will be TBD.", "In terms of the, your questions around the M&A side. Obviously the revenue line, we brought Yahoo and you brought XO and those brought revenue on day one, when you close a transactions or same thing with the Telematics businesses as we closed in the back half of last year, but initially especially the Telematics businesses and Yahoo not significant.", "The EBITDA or EPS line maybe a little bit of pressure, the EPS line if anything about $0.04 on a year-to-date basis. And then they also bring depreciation and amortization, which is why there may not a huge amount of pressure at the EBITDA line, but as you move down the income statements of operating income and EPS, we see a little pressure this year. As we expand those businesses going forward we expect them to contribute in the future.", "David Barden", "Great. Okay, thanks.", "Michael Stefanski", "Eunice, next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Mike Rollins of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael Rollins", "Well thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. First, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the three to five year view for wireless. Can you just help us understand the Verizon\u2019s expectations with the investments you are making, the technology that you are deploying? How investor should think about top-line growth over a more extended period of time?", "And then secondly, if you could delve into a little bit more detail on some of the businesses you have acquired in over the last couple of years. In terms of Oath and Telamatics and how should investors think about the growth of those businesses over the next couple of years as well on the top-line especially? Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, thanks Mike. So look, as you think about the while this business going forward and obviously I\u2019m going to talk specifically about our views on 2018 and so on. We will have those discussions when we get to January. But you think of the business overall, we are very confident with where seeing the growth start to migrate to we talked about the trends in service revenue, the fact that we should expect those to get back to positive during 2018 once we have worked through the transition fully from subsidized to unsubsidized pricing.", "We think it will continue from there, we will continue to add net adds to the business based of the quality of the network. And then the network will continue to expand the capabilities as we transition to 5G and we think that will give us other opportunities to expand the wireless business going forward.", "So we are very confident in the future trajectory of the business there and obviously as we think about three to five year view, the overall GDP is going to play into that. But as I think about 5G and what it\u2019s going to do for the business going forward, and then as I think about the new businesses coming in, and contributing as we expand those and then continuing to work on the cost side of the business as Lowell described last month. I don't think that you're going to recognize the business five years from now versus where it is today.", "Michael Rollins", "If I could just follow-up on that point, the wireline business is something where you upgraded significant amount to fiber, but you also have some copper, you're competing for a full - bundle in a lot of your market, but you're smaller relative to some of your video competitors. Have you thought about doing something different in the wireline business in terms of the way the footprint will look, whether it's through 5G or other investments in the wireline business or other strategic options for that assets.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, so there is a lot in that question Mike. So look fundamentally as you think about the wireline business you're thinking about really two assets there, you have got the legacy copper business which continues to have a secular declines across our set of customers, whether that the consumer, enterprise, small business whatever.", "And then you have the fiber side of that business where we see continued growth and demand. And that's just not within the [indiscernible] footprint, its more international sales. So if you think around we have had the Ultra-Long-Haul backbone for a number of years now, earlier this year we expanded that with the XO acquisition which added fiber metro rings in the 45 of the top 50 markets. We obviously have significant fiber in the Northeast corridors, we have been building Fios over the last 10 years.", "So you should expect to see the fiber side of the wireline business continue to grow and become more relevant and then as part of that you have got the convergence of the network between the fiber network and the wireless network as we [indiscernible] 4G and preposition for 5G. So as we go forward here we think that the combination of those networks is incredibly important.", "Michael Rollins", "Thank you.", "Michael Stefanski", "Mike thank you. Next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead with your question.", "Craig Moffett", "Hi, thanks. First Mike, I just wanted to say congratulations on a terrific career in IR and thank you on perhaps all the help you have given us and Brady congratulations on your new position as well. I wanted to ask about consolidation, because it's obviously the top - and from what Sprint and T Mobile has said, we could see an announcement as early as next week. Can you talk about how you think a Sprint, T Mobile merger will change the competitive landscape and would you argue to the SEC and [indiscernible] in favor of approving a transaction like that?", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes Craig, look I would tell you, there is a lot of various rumors and so on around the industry overtime around various M&A activity and I\u2019m not going to comment on other people\u2019s businesses. I would tell you, we have the right set of assets to compete irrespective of the industry structure and that\u2019s what we are focused on and I\u2019m very confident in our ability to be successful however things play out with other people?", "Craig Moffett", "Thanks. Could I ask, since there\u2019s not much to say on that topic, one separate question then? Could you update us on the 5G fixed wireless broadband trials, what you are seeing and how that informs your expectations for what you are going to do in 2018?", "Matthew Ellis", "Absolutely. So we will have more specifics on that later in the quarter and we will get the right folks talking about that. But I can say the trials are going very well and we are getting a lot of good experience using the millimeter wave spectrum and some other things we are seeing whether it\u2019s a fact that we can deliver service without needing line of sight, whether it\u2019s think about MDUs and the number of floors we can deliver service to being more than we expected.", "We have experienced delivering service in MDUs above 20 floors, which is more than we thought it would be going into the trial. So a number of good things coming out of the trials, we will get back to all of you later in the quarter with more specific details on the results of the trials and what that means for 2018, but nothing has change about our intent to launch the fixed wireless broadband offering during the course of 2018.", "Craig Moffett", "Okay, bye guys.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you. Next question please Eunice?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike McCormack of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael McCormack", "Hey guys thanks. Matt, in the prepared remarks, you talked about over-the-top and some of the video pressure that we have all been hearing about a lot more recently. How do you guys look at that? When you look at the customers leaving you, is it leaving just the video piece of it and maintaining the broadband connection or are you just seeing a shift to different providers generally?", "And then secondly, the spread between those making device payments in wireless versus those that are on unsubsidized plans, how many of those in your best estimate are people that actually were making a payment plan to you guys, pay off the phone and are opting into sort of a lower price point instead of upgrading the phone?", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, thanks Mike. So look on your first question. There is really nothing new here to us in terms of the trends we have been seeing over the past few years around whether it\u2019s cord-cutting or [cord-nevers] (Ph) or whatever else. In fact, we have spoken in the past two or three years ago, we really started to speaking about this and the fact we said the traditional linear TV bundle is not long-term sustainable and you saw our reaction to that when we launched some of the different plans that we launched at that point in time.", "But so, we are not surprised by what we are seeing around the TV, but I would tell you what is important, when you move to over-the-top for your video entertainment, the quality of that broadband connection becomes more important than ever and if you want a quality broadband connection Fios and fiber to the home connection is the best option out there. And we continue to see strong numbers on the broadband side of the business as a result of that and we are very confident that the Fios Internet offering will continue to be very strong in the marketplace.", "As I think about the spread between the unsubsidized and the subsidized payments. Look, what you have here is you do have customers who were on subsidized pricing, get to the end of two-year contract and they then move to unsubsidized pricing and not necessarily getting there through upgrading to a new device and do a net on device payment plan.", "But that migration as we say is largely completely now have 78% of the base which meets virtually all of the consumer bases now on unsubsidized pricing. So as we go forward here the gap between the this year and the last year number will get narrower and narrower. And that's what is going to help drive the service revenue trajectory improvement as we go forward here.", "Michael McCormack", "And Matt I'm sorry just quickly on the hurricane issue, you guys called out the one penny impact. But anything with respect to volumes in wireless that may have been even better as the hurricanes might have?", "Matthew Ellis", "Certainly we had in both Huston and Florida, we have period of times when our stores were closed and certainly that\u2019s an impact. But we also saw good volumes as soon as those stores reopened, customer realizing in times like that you want to be on the best network and so we saw an uptick as soon as those stores reopened.", "And I have to get credit to our teams, whether it be on the network side and all the things they did and also our teams in the distribution side of the business, getting those stores open incredibly quickly after those storms, they did a fantastic job.", "Michael McCormack", "Great. and congratulations Mike and Brady.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you Mike. Eunice Next question please?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer Fritzsch", "Great, thank you for taking the question. Matt if I may, I just wanted to ask on fiber we have all been brought up to be believe fiber is really expensive to deploy. And yet we see you coming into the lower end of your CapEx range. I'm not asking you for guidance on 2018, but are you seeing some savings with these XO properties. Are you deploying those laterals yet, or is that going to be more kind of a 2018 event?", "And then if I also just could ask on the other element of 5G spectrum. I think [indiscernible] you feel comfortable with spectrum might that not even sit in the spectrum auction. Can you talk a little bit of how you as you look at your inventory are you feeling comfortable still with what you have? thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, so I'll answer the spectrum question first. We believe that we have a great portfolio of spectrum. As you look at the 4G network only approximately 50% just over 50% of our spectrum portfolio server in that network today. We have got additional spectrum assets that will serve that network in 2018 whether that the [Refarm] (Ph) and 850 and PCS or whether it would be put in the AWS-3 to work.", "And additionally as you move into the 5G world, we look forward to closing the straight path transactions and the XO spectrum transaction as head into 2018. So we are comfortable with our spectrum positions. As we think about future auctions we will wait to see what is in there or make assessments at that time. but very comfortable with the portfolio we have today.", "And as obviously as we think about added capacity to the network we have more than spectrum as the tools available to us as we go forward, and we have talked about the different technology and architecture tools with LTE Advance and all the different pieces in there. We continue to be able to add capacity as we move to more software defined networking and those type of tools and in obviously densification.", "And that densification based of having more fiber available in the network. So to get to your first question, we continue to deploy fiber and we will continue to do that as we head into 2018 as you say I'm not going to talk to 2018 CapEx at this time, but you should expect to see us continue to be deploying fiber around the country as we go forward to service both wireless but also customers across the rest of our businesses and getting into IoT applications as well.", "Michael Stefanski", "Jennifer thank you and Eunice next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thanks very much. I was wondering if I could build upon the prior questions around your spending trajectory. If we think about this lower-end CapEx target for the year, how should we consider the outlook against that backdrop of investment? Clearly, focusing on network quality is a clear focus for you folks. I\u2019m just trying to unpack the commentary a touch, whether it\u2019s a shift in some of the spending priorities that\u2019s taking place that\u2019s enabling you to get to the lower end? Are we seeing inflection with the benefits from software-defined networks flowing through the business at this point? Or anything to that effect, Matt?", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, good question, thank you Amir. So as I think about the CapEx for the year and where it\u2019s coming in towards the lower end of the range. That\u2019s still going to be around 17 billion of spend, so certainly not in significant number. Some of this is just a timing of the activity with the network teams between 2017 and 2018l. But look, I would tell you that the key thing here and you talk about has there been any shift in priorities and I would say absolutely not.", "The priority to continue to invest in the network whether that\u2019s adding capacity for the networks today or pre-positioning the network and being at the leading edge of building the future network technologies, that priority is unchanged and as we had into 2018, you will see that we will continue to spend to continue to do exactly those things. So no major change there, as we head into 2018, more spending on fiber as we pre-position for 5G and continue to make sure we have the leading network.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thanks a lot, and one follow-up, if I may. In touching upon that 5G commentary, in recent weeks, we have seen some notable developments around the broader ecosystem, in particular the announcement with Qualcomm to accelerate the global 5G standard in millimeter wave spectrum. It seems like mobile 5G, in terms of its availability, is now being pulled forward. Is that going to affect the type of services that you plan to offer? Could we see mobile 5G a bit earlier than anticipated here? Any color to that effect would be great.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes. So I think we were very proud to be part of that announcement with Qualcomm earlier this week and really what you are seeing there is as we have talked about now for the past two to three years. We said if we put our shoulder behind 5G development. We think, we can accelerate versus some of the timing of safety place. And in fact, there were some people who were saying they didn\u2019t even think 5G was going to be real and if you be able to use millimeter wave spectrum.", "So we have demonstrated that by our effort so far, we have brought the ecosystem together, we have push forward the timing of standards coming forward and not surprised by any of that at all. It\u2019s exact as we expected. In terms of the timing of mobile 5G, it\u2019s certainly not a 2018 activity.", "But you talk about does it change our view on the types of services we will be able to offer, absolutely not. We have seen a wide range of services that we will be able to offer on 5G has - why we have been so excited about it, quite frankly and while we put our shoulder behind get in the ecosystem to move faster on this than they otherwise would have been and we look forward to being in position to offer those services in the years ahead.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thanks very much for the input.", "Michael Stefanski", "Thank you and Eunice we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your last question comes from Tim Horan of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question.", "Timothy Horan", "Thanks guys. And just upon the CapEx again. Matt are you seeing any benefits from kind of the [SDN] (Ph) in terms of pricing of equipment. And can you just talk about as you move to 5G. should we think about CapEx stepping up a couple of billion dollars a year? there is a lot of articles in the press over the last couple years that it might talk close to $20 billion $50 billion to build out a nationwide 5G network. Any color around that would be great.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes so thanks Tim. So in terms of benefits from SDN and so on, let me show as you not just SDN but also network function, virtualization it does allow the value of some of the hardware you put in the network to change overtime, and how you operate network moves more to the underlying software there. So I think we will see those trends as we continue to expand the network.", "In terms of deployment of 5G, I think some of the people who are estimating those numbers are getting ahead of themselves and it\u2019s just too early to tell. So as we have more visibility into the timing of spend around 5G we will share that with you, but it's way too early at this point and I'm not going to comment on those estimates.", "Timothy Horan", "And then just lastly on the $10 billion of expense reduction. How much of that do you think you'll reinvest and maybe growth in the business. I guess how should we would be think about the longer term margin trend over the three to five year period?", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes, so as you think about the money, really wants to be generate those savings it becomes part of the overall pull. But I'm excited about the opportunities that the teams are developing to grow the business going forward and it's important that we make sure that we have the resources in the business to invest in those things. and we can't be investing in those things if we have inefficiencies in the core business to that point in time. So we just think it's a responsible thing to do to make sure that we constantly look at the efficiency of the business and look forward to generating those savings and discussing that more with you in the future.", "Michael Stefanski", "Tim, thank you and before we end the call I would like turn it back to Matt for a few closing comments.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks Mike. I would like to close the call with the few key points. We remain focused on our strategy to invest in our networks while expanding our high quality customer base and developing new platforms and solutions. We are well positioned to compete in the current environment while leading the industry into the next generation of technology with our strong network of assets. We are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and to generate long-term shareholder value.", "Finally before I close the call today, I want to personally thank Mike for this commitment and the support he has given to me and many others throughout his career of Verizon. And we wish him all the best in the future. We will also like to welcome Brady Connor to the IR team. I have known Brady for several years and he will be a great successor to Mike in addition to the IR team.", "Thank you for your time today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen this does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Brady Connor, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Brady Connor", "Thanks Brad. Good morning, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. This is Brady Connor, and I\u2019m here with our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Lowell McAdam, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Matt Ellis.", "As a reminder, our earnings release, financial and operating information, and the presentation slides are available on the Investor Relations website. A replay and transcript of this call will also be made available on our website.", "Before we get started, I like to draw your attention to our Safe Harbor statement on Slide 2. Information in this presentation contains statements about expected future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. Discussion of factors that may affect future results is contained in Verizon\u2019s filings with the SEC, which are now available on our website.", "This presentation contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included in the financial materials we have posted on our website. The quarterly growth rates disclosed in our presentation slides enduring our formal remarks are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted as sequential.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Lowell.", "Lowell McAdam", "Thank you Brady, and good morning everyone. I wanted to join today's call to talk about 2017 results, the implications of tax reform to Verizon and then to talk about our strategic priorities for 2018.", "Let me start off by recapping our impressive performance this year. I am proud of the focus and the execution from our team in 2017. We regained positive momentum in the marketplace and delivered strong operational and financial results. We launched", "and expanded the most reliable unlimited experience for our customers, executed the world\u2019s largest successful 5G pre-commercial trial, invested in assets and platforms for the future and gained significant traction in the integration of new businesses.", "We finished the year with great momentum in the fourth quarter as evidenced by our smartphone net additions and reoccurring levels of outstanding customer loyalty. In addition, the improvement in our wireless service revenue trajectory positions the business for growth moving forward.", "The integration of new businesses is accelerating our mobile-first digital strategy and providing a platform for global reach. In 2017 we made significant progress with our Oath assets as we build engaging brands around the key pillars of news, sports, finance and lifestyle and we leverage the Oath capabilities across all of our Verizon properties.", "The game changing content and technology partnerships that we recently announced with the NFL and NBA are great examples of how we are accelerating our digital right strategy with Yahoo sports and Verizon\u2019s family of digital media brands. We are becoming the first screen for fans of live sports and superior partners for advertisers positioning us to show live-action in the engaging ways people want to consume video content.", "We are investing for the future while maintaining a well-rounded approach to funding all aspects of our business. We enhanced our financial profile in 2017 with a number of transactions that strengthened the balance sheet that included lowering our borrowing cost, extending out our debt maturities and making a significant voluntary contribution to the pension fund.", "Now let's take a look forward. We ended the year with the president signing tax reform into law effectively restructuring the tax code for U.S. corporations. Verizon has long supported corporate tax reform that reduces rates to globally competitive levels and we are very pleased to see this legislation passed. The new tax law will have a positive impact to Verizon\u2019s cash flow and earnings profile.", "We expect tax reform to enhance our cash flow from operations in 2018 by approximately $3.5 billion to $4 billion. We have been disciplined in our approach to capital allocation since the inception of Verizon. We have always been focused on keeping our network the gold standard and investing in the business for growth while strengthening our balance sheet and maintaining strong dividend performance for our shareholders. This will continue to be the driving force behind the use of cash savings from tax reform.", "And by strengthening the balance sheet it will give us the flexibility to execute our strategies going forward. Our employees drive the innovation and success of our business, so it is vital that we all share in the success of not only tax reform but the overall performance of Verizon. We will provide details on how we are investing in our employees later today, and will provide those details outside the company later today.", "We are good corporate citizens and share our success with the community. In 2017, Verizon and its foundation donated $75 million for disaster recovery and community projects. We will increase our contributions to the Verizon foundation by $200 million to $300 million over the next two years with the additional funds being dedicated to our efforts around human ability. And by human ability we mean applying our technology to making our customers lives better.", "Combined these two initiatives will have an approximate $0.05 to $0.06 impact to our earnings per share for each of the next two years. As we head into 2018 our strategic priorities remain clear and are unchanged. The cornerstone of our strategy continues to be our best in class wireless network, which continues to be ranked number one in the nation in both voice and data network quality. Our unbroken run of JD Power and RootMetrics awards keeps getting longer.", "In our history, Verizon has always been in the forefront of technology innovation. We have led the transformation of the wireless industry from analog to today's fourth generation LTE service. Now we have an unprecedented opportunity in front of us as we drive the evolution of the U.S. wireless industry to the fifth generation of mobile services.", "Not too long ago people were saying 5G would not be possible until sometime between 2020 and 2022. Only one carrier has been consistent in its actions and messaging regarding 5G. Verizon has the spectrum bandwidth needed to provide the rich services of true 5G, our intelligent edge network capabilities and engineering know-how to lead the industry in providing the full suite of 5G gigabit services.", "The investment and pre-positioning of assets that we have accomplished will enable us to deliver the full range of 5G services including mobility, residential broadband, sub-millisecond latency applications, and other advanced consumer and IoT use cases. We have flexed our innovation muscle and are now taking 5G from a mere possibility to commercial reality by bringing 3 to 5 cities online this year with commercial services. The next industrial revolution will be on Verizon\u2019s network and will positively impact society like no technology we have seen before. As we say around our offices, we don't wait for the future. We build it, and we are doing it again with 5G.", "Now I will hand the call over to Matt to talk about the financial and operating details of the business starting with Slide 4.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks, Lowell. It is great to be with you today and to share the results of our strong performance. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we reported earnings of $4.56 per share and full year earnings of $7.36 per share on a GAAP basis. These reported results include several special items that I would like to highlight. Our reported earnings include a net pre-tax loss from special items of about $2.6 billion. This net loss consists of severance and mark-to-market adjustments for pension and OPEB liabilities of $1.2 billion, early debt redemption costs of $681 million, a charge for product realignment around early stage developmental technologies of $671 million, acquisition and integration related charges of $154 million pertaining mainly to Yahoo, and a non-cash pre-tax gain on spectrum license transactions of about $144 million.", "Additionally, as noted in our 8-K filing last week, the new tax law resulted in a one-time benefit of approximately $16.8 billion, or $4.10 per share. This benefit is primarily related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% corporate income tax rate. The cumulative net impact from these items after-tax was approximately $15.2 billion or $3.71 per share. Excluding the full effect of these items, adjusted earnings per share was $0.86 in the fourth quarter, which is flat compared to our performance in the same quarter a year ago.", "For the full year adjusted earnings per share was $3.74. Now let us move to a summary of the consolidated financial highlights of the quarter on Slide 5. In the fourth quarter, total operating revenue was $34 billion, an improvement of 5% and for the full year 2017 revenue was $126 billion. On a comparable basis, excluding divestures and new businesses, adjusted operating revenues declined approximately 2% for the year.", "For the full year, consolidated adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items totaled approximately $45.1 billion and consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.7%, slightly higher than last year's margin of 35.5%.", "Let us turn now to our wireless results on Slide 6. Our value proposition of providing unlimited service on the best network together with the simplicity of our offers is driving increased engagement from our valued customers. In the fourth quarter, total wireless operating revenue increased 1.7% to $23.8 billion, our first positive year-over-year growth in two years.", "For the full year, operating revenue totaled $87.5 billion, a decline of 1.9%. The sequential results in service revenue increased for the second consecutive quarter by 0.2% to $15.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis, service revenues declined by 2.9%, a marked improvement over the same period last year.", "The improved trends to service revenues are attributed to several factors, including increased access revenues and new account formation. Our postpaid phone base migrations to un-subsidized service pricing are progressing and now represent approximately 80% of our postpaid phone base, approaching steady-state as most of our business customers remain on subsidized plans.", "In the fourth quarter, equipment revenue increased to $6.5 billion up 12.9% for the quarter and 7.8% for the full year. At the end of the quarter approximately 49% of our postpaid phone customers had an outstanding device payment plan balance. During the quarter we generated $9.5 billion of EBITDA, an increase of 9.6%. Wireless EBITDA margin was 39.8% compared to approximately 36.9% in the same period last year. As expected, the improvement in EBITDA was a function of better trends in service revenue and lower promotional activity than the prior year. For the full year, we generated $38.6 billion of EBITDA on total revenues of $87.5 billion.", "Now let us turn to Slide 7 and take a closer look at wireless connections growth. In the fourth quarter, total smartphone net adds were 647,000 compared to 456,000 last year. Total postpaid net adds were 1.2 million, including phone adds of 431,000, 193,000 tablets and 550,000 other connected devices, predominantly wearables. For the third consecutive quarter we increased customer accounts adding 40,000 to our base.", "For the full year, postpaid net additions of 2.1 million included 774,000 phones, 31,000 tablets, and 1.3 million other connected devices. Our competitiveness in 2017 was highlighted by smartphone net adds of 1.8 million, up 34% versus the prior year. The overall experience of pairing our unlimited plan with the best network continues to resonate with our customer base, resulting in outstanding retail postpaid churn of 1.00%, and phone churn of 0.77% in the fourth quarter.", "On a year-over-year basis, postpaid churn improved by 10 basis points driven primarily by strong phone results. In the quarter, postpaid device activations totaled 12.4 million down from 13.1 million last year. About 82% of these activations were phones with wearables accounting for the majority of the other device activations.", "Our retail postpaid upgrade rate was 7.2%, up sequentially as expected but was lower compared to the prior year. We are seeing an elongation of the upgrade cycle as more customers hold onto their devices for a longer period. During the quarter, 8.1 million phones were activated on device payment plans.", "Pre-paid net additions declined by 184,000 compared to a decline of 9,000 in the prior year. Our smartphone prepaid base increased during the quarter. All of the decline in prepaid net additions was due to basic prepaid phones as we have deliberately reduced our focus in that area. We ended 2017 with 116 million total retail connections, excluding wholesale and Internet of Things. Our industry-leading postpaid connections base grew 1.9% to 111 million, and our prepaid connections totaled 5.4 million for the year.", "Let us move next to our wireline segment on Slide 8. Total operating revenues for the wireline segment increased 0.1% in the quarter and 0.6% for the full year. On an organic basis, excluding revenues from our XO acquisition, segment revenues declined in the quarter by 3.6%. Growth from our high quality fiber-based products continues to be offset by secular pressures from legacy technologies and competition. Consumer markets\u2019 revenue decreased 1.4% in the quarter as Fios internet growth was overshadowed by declines in video and copper.", "For the full year, consumer revenues grew by 0.2%. Consumer Fios revenue grew by 1.7% in the quarter. Fios revenue growth is primarily driven by an increase in the total customer base and strong demand for higher internet speeds, including our gigabit connection launched early in 2017. In the quarter, we added 47,000 Fios internet customers.", "We now have a total of about 5.9 million Fios internet subscribers representing a 40.1% penetration rate. In Fios video, the business faced ongoing headwinds as observed throughout the linear TV market. The Fios video business ended with 29,000 subscriber losses in the quarter and 75,000 for the year.", "Our multiuse fiber initiative is progressing as expected. This provides the foundational layer for multiple ways to interface with a wide array of customers and is the cornerstone of our intelligent edge network. We launched our partnership with Boston in 2016 and are seeing good results in that area. We announced our public private partnership with Sacramento in June of 2017, and you will see more activity from us on this front as progressive municipalities work with Verizon to bring new technologies to their communities.", "For the quarter, excluding XO, Enterprise Solutions revenue decreased 4.1%. New customer wins and growth in advanced communications products were more than offset by secular and pricing pressures in our legacy offerings and technologies. Partner Solutions revenue, excluding XO, decreased 5.8%. Strong demand for fiber access is a growth opportunity for this business. In business markets revenue declined 5.6% without XO.", "We are competing and winning with our fiber-based products but continue to see declines in legacy technologies. Segment EBITDA margin was 20.9% for the quarter and 21.1% for the year. Our commitments, operational gains and efficiencies in the business were largely offset by content cost escalations producing a stable margin profile. Let\u2019s move next to Slide 9 to discuss our media and Telematics businesses.", "Our integration efforts for the Oath assets are progressing ahead of schedule. We remain focused on exploiting synergies across all of that media assets to create a streamline platform with rich engaging content and simple functionality. For the quarter Oath revenue is $2.2 billion, an increase of approximately 10% sequentially. As expected revenue trends were driven by increase appetizing spend during the holiday season and we expect to see the normal seasonality from fourth quarter to first quarter. Our Telematics business which includes Fleetmatics and Telogis continues to grow. Total Telematics revenue increased to just over $230 million. IoT revenues increased approximately 8% in the quarter on an organic basis. Our solution set is evolving as our engagement with municipalities gains more momentum with increasing multi-use fiber deployments and the commercial rollout of 5G services.", "Let's move next to Slide 10 to discuss our cash flows. In 2017 cash flow from operations totaled $25.3 billion including the $2.1 billion net after tax discretionary pension funding and the $6.0 billion impact from completing the transition to on balance sheet device payment receivable financing. On a year-over-year basis our cash flow has improved by $2.5 billion. As expected full year capital expenditures were $17.2 billion. Free cash flow for the year totaled $8.1 billion and does not include $4.3 billion of proceeds from asset backed securitizations.", "The transition to on balance sheet accounting for device payment plan receivables and funding is now substantially complete. Changes going forward will mostly reflect seasonality and wireless equipment volumes. We ended the year with $117.1 billion of total debt comprised of $108.2 billion of unsecured debt and $8.9 billion of on balance sheet securitizations. Our new term unsecured maturities are modest to $2.3 billion through the end of 2019. Our balance sheet is strong and provides us the financial flexibility to methodically investor growth in the business. ", "Now let's take a look at 2018 on Slide 11. As Lowell mentioned upfront out strategic priorities of 2018 are clear. Our focus is on executing on the fundamentals which positions the business\u2019 strong performance in the upcoming year. We expect year-over-year consolidated revenue to grow at low single-digits in 2018 on a GAAP reported basis. Excluding the impact from the near revenue recognition standard we are on track to achieve year-over-year wireless service growth by the middle part of 2018.", "As we disclosed in our January 17, 2018 8-K filing the new revenue standard will negatively impact wireless service revenue. Inclusive of the new standard we expect wireless service revenue growth to turn positive towards the end of 2018 or early 2019.", "The benefits of our business excellence initiative included the deployment of zero based budgeting will begin to show up in our results in 2018. We expect low single digit growth in adjusted earnings per share which includes the diluted impacts from the full year of depreciation and amortization cost from 2017 acquisitions. The straight path acquisition expected to close later in the first quarter. And the ongoing impact of the last year's data centered divestitures. This is before the impact of tax reform on the revenue recognition standard.", "In terms of tax legislation we expect the savings to generate a net $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion uplift to cash flows from operations in 2018 and is expected to yield a $0.55 to $0.65 increase to EPS in 2018. [Net of our] employee initiative and contributions to the Verizon foundation that Lowell mentioned earlier. The resulting 2018 effective tax rate for Verizon is projected to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Lowell stated earlier there are internal capital decision process and return objectives have not changed. We are consistent and methodical in our allocation. We expected consolidated capital spending to be between $17.0 billion and $17.8 billion including the commercial launch of 5G. With that I will turn the call back over to Brady, so we can get your questions.", "Brady Connor", "Thank you Matt. Brad we are now ready to take questions.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Philip Cusick of JP Morgan. You may go ahead.", "Philip Cusick", "Hi, thanks. One for Matt and one for Lowell if I can. First Matt, I wonder if you can talk about the company's target leverage and is there any change in your thoughts or the discussions with the rating agencies on what appropriate EBITDA multiple when your conversion from EBITDA to cash flow is now substantially better because of lower taxes and then Lowell can you please discuss Verizon\u2019s view of the attractiveness of media assets in general? A year ago you offered a definitive no on any interest in buying big media and yet Verizon has been thrown out as a potential buyer and nearly every media M&A story of 2017 which has probably been confusing for your investors. Can you just give us an update? Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Good morning Phil. I will take the first question. So the target leverage we haven't specified an exact number there but as we have said consistently we want to strengthen the balance sheet. The additional proceeds from the benefit of tax reform allow us to get there little faster. The key here is to have a strong balance sheet that allows us to pursue and execute on our strategy as quickly and as efficiently as we can. So as we say we haven't given an exact leverage target but you should expect us to deleverage from where we are today. We said previously getting into the same type of profile that we had prior to the Vodafone transaction, so I think that gives you a general review at the direction we would like to head. In terms of the rating agencies not had any specific conversations with them since tax reform happened about how that may change their views but certainly it gives us the ability to bring the leverage down at a little faster rates and we look forward to doing that through [\u201818] and we will continue to have conversations with them and put the balance sheet in a place where it continues to support the business.", "Lowell McAdam", "And Phil, good morning. I guess my first comment is I guess it's nice to be loved. So there certainly is a lot of interest here which frankly we ignored. But I think in seriousness there is a lot of movement in this area right now and we don't even know whether AT&T is going to get approved. It's clear that the messages that Disney and Fox are sending is that scale matters. So we look at this but you have to take a look at whether being a big independent distributor is a reasonable alternative to owning content. And I think until all of this shakes out you really can't determine whether that's a path we would be interested in but I can say unequivocally there is nothing going on right now without considering a large media play. In fact if you look at our actions things like the NBA and the NFL announcement that we have made in the last few weeks we think being a great partner being able to monetize through advertising and being independent is a very good place to play for us right now. And that's still further notice that's what our investors should assume we are doing.", "Philip Cusick", "That's helpful. Thanks Lowell, thanks, Matt.", "Lowell McAdam", "Brad, let's take the next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Simon Flannery of Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead with your question.", "Simon Flannery", "Great, thank you very much and good morning. And one for Matt and Lowell as well. Matt, can you just help us with the math from Q4 to Q1 around the revenue recognition. You're moving some revenues from service revenues to equipment and then you should get at least a temporary EBITDA and EPS left. If you can just give us a little bit more color around what we should be modeling there.", "And then Lowell, you obviously went through the 5G role in a lot of detail in November or a couple of months past. Can you give us a little bit more clarity about what we should be expecting for the rest of the year, when should we see Sacramento launching, what about announcing from the other cities? How many pops should we be expecting covered in 2018 and then into '19? Thank you.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks, Simon. So, I'll take the first part of that on the adoption of revenue recognition. So, a couple of things that firstly we created an opening balance sheet adjustment to reflect some of the treatment of open contracts, assuming they had been recorded under the new standard.", "Remember, unlike most adoption of accounting standards, the prior periods are not being recast and so you'll have it all difference between the accounting standards for the 2018 numbers versus the 2017 comparison. You'll see that so as we go through the year. And we report '18 on the new standard. We'll also give a view as what '18 would have looked like if it's been under the old standard as well.", "So, in terms of breaking those pieces apart as we said in AK last week, total revenue won't have any significant impact from the change but there will be a change in geography. We'll record more equipment revenue unless service revenue initially based off that change and how we treat contracts that are still subsidized which is primarily our B2B contracts.", "And in the biggest impact of the EBITDA line's going to come from how we treat commissions and rather than taking those commission expenses and expensing them immediately when they're incurred, they'll get spread over the life of or the estimated life of the underlying customer contract.", "Now, the opening balance sheet adjustment is only for the open contracts that had a 24-month commitment or promo cost. So, it doesn't relate to all of the contracts. So, that's why you'll see a build-up in that over the next two years. So, we said the net benefit in '18 to be about $0.9 billion to $1.2 billion because of the change in accounting standards; most of that coming from the commission's line.", "We didn\u2019t break it up by quarter but I think you should expect it not to be too dissimilar from quarter-to-quarter as we go through the year. And then the impact in '18 would be bigger than it will be in '19 and then it'll be largely immaterial by the time we get to '20 because that contract asset builds up on the balance sheet. We'll reach a plateau level where the ins and outs are equal, by the time we get into '18 they won't be materially different.", "So, hopefully that answers your question on rev rec.", "Simon Flannery", "Thank you.", "Lowell McAdam", "Okay, and Simon on 5G. As you indicated, we shared a lot of information in November. The trials are continuing to go extremely well for us. We have more than 200 sites up online. We continue to learn every day. The distances that we shared are and the throughputs are very consistent up to about 2000 feet, which is much better than we expected.", "We're doing more testing around throughputs. We're seeing 10 Gigabits of peak throughputs. So, we're very comfortable with being able to deliver a gigabit of service at everyone that we're providing service to. As you may have seen the new standard, the global standard was approved in December and we've announced with Qualcomm bringing chips online that will fit that standard in the second half of '18.", "So, we will be deploying with our proprietary standard but also very quickly in '18 coming on with the global standard as well. If you saw what was going on at CES, there was a lot of discussion about devices and we believe that there will be mobile devices late in 2018 and then more available as we get into 2019.", "If you saw just last week, the FCC approved our purchase of straight path and so we're excited about moving that forward to close. So, as far as execution goes and pops, we're placing the fiber that we need now as we shared and I know you were there. In November, we shared the number of incremental sites that you need over a densified 4G network, is much smaller than we had expected.", "So, we're not seeing that sort of capital intensity that some were assuming. So, as you indicated, we've announced Sacramento. We have three to five plan for the year. I am personally out meeting with some of the mayors talking about what we're going to be providing and the reception has been extremely positive.", "So, as you know, it takes a little while to work through the city governments and get these things approved. But Sacramento is a terrific model for us. We continue to build that partnership and I wouldn\u2019t suspect it'll be too much longer before you'll see the other cities announce. And then we can be more specific on pops.", "But as far as capital goes, Matt told you what our guidance was for the year. We are reallocating the capital that we have been spending. We don\u2019t see any upward pressure of this in this year. And we'll be able to determine the return on invested capital as we go through these trials in these commercial launches and we'll share more information as the year moves along.", "Simon Flannery", "Great, thank you very much.", "Lowell McAdam", "Okay, Brad. Let's take the next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Hodulik of UBS. Your line is open.", "John Hodulik", "Thanks, guys. Either for from Matt or Lowell. Can you guys talk about the low single-digit GAAP earnings guidance which I assume includes straight path and the $0.5 to $0.6 from increase in the charitable contribution? Talk about the some of the underlying drivers of that. You've seen wireless cap our EBITDA margins continue to move up, some pressure on the wireline side.", "Is that what we can expect for 2018 and talk about how you see that the competitive environment evolving in the wireless market that may support continue to increase in margins on that side? Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Yes. Thanks, John. Good morning. So, year-end ago we talked about the low single-digit GAAP earnings. And we talked about a few below-the-line items in the straight path will be dilutive because we're largely paying for that transaction in shares. And you will see an uptick in D&A cost because of the transactions we did last year.", "But we're confident the underlying earnings are improving. You're seeing that come through the service revenue on the wireless side to the business. You saw that number improve to just a negative 2.9 in the fourth quarter. And then we said on an apples-to-apples basis getting back to flat-to-positive by the middle part of the year.", "So, excited that we've completed that journey of transitioning the base and look forward to continuing to see wireless revenue growth from there. Wireline, I think in 2018 will be on a similar trajectory that you've seen in the past couple of years. Although as we continue to deploy more fiber in the network, it gives us opportunities to replace some of those earnings that were on copper based products with fiber based products which should be more sustainable going forward.", "So, net you should certainly see an improvement in the earnings profile of the company versus the last couple of years. And then you mentioned the charitable contribution in your comment. I want to be clear that the guide is before the impact of tax reform and revenue recognition and when we say before the impact of tax reform we also mean the net impact of tax reform which includes the contribution to the foundation and the employee piece.", "So, the low single-digit EPS guide is before that $0.5 to $0.6 impact of those couple of initiatives Lowell described, which is baked into that $0.55 to $0.65 positive impact from tax reform. So, hopefully that gives you a little more clarity on the moving parts within there. But it's built off the underlying earnings profile been stronger year-over-year.", "John Hodulik", "Okay. Thanks, Matt.", "Lowell McAdam", "Brad, we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brett Feldman of Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.", "Brett Feldman", "Thanks for taking the question. I've got two follow-ups here around the impact of tax reforms. You talked a bit about how you're going to be taking advantage of some of the benefits you're going to see. I'm curious if we could expand on that.", "Do you see an opportunity to maybe reinvest some of the savings in your competitive behavior meaning we've had kind of a com period here to end of year, you've invested a lot in your business? Is there an opening here for you to maybe spend a bit more to get customers revisit your network or even just to get your existing customers to maybe move into newer devices, whether it can take advantage of some of your network investments even making recently.", "And then just also, we're kind of hoping that at a broader corporate level you'll see a lot of changes in behavior. You obviously have relationships with large enterprises. I know its early days but in your discussions with them, are you seeing any green shoes that perhaps will start increasing investments in their businesses and ways that can maybe have a positive lateral implication for your enterprises services segment down the road? Thanks.", "Lowell McAdam", "Okay. Well, let me start out Brett, on that, and then Matt and certainly add in. on the competitive front, you've been around me for years. I have said from 1983, when I got involved in telecom and wireless, that it's an extremely competitive market. And that competition can come from different places at different times but it's always very strong.", "Verizon has never been one to lead the market down from a price perspective and we're certainly not going to change that now. Our focus inside the business is to use the assets that we have in our portfolio today like owe to be competitive in ways that the others can't compete. And as we roll 5G out, we see much more opportunity to be innovative as a way to be competitive versus using tax reform to just take our prices down.", "Now, on your enterprise front. I think we've all been very pleased at how the market and the economy has run up here since tax reform. And just like we're positioning ourselves to be able to execute and accelerate our strategies, I see other businesses doing the same thing. And telecom is such an important part to the productivity measures of a lot of these enterprises, we do see the opportunity to pick this up.", "But we remember we're only 30 days end of the tax reform process and we're all trying to understand the implications and what we can accelerate and how we can accelerate. So, where we build our fiber, where we're deploying 5G, what enterprises are telling us they want to do with our Intelligent Edge Network is influencing where we put our capital dollars. And I expect this to continue and I expect to see things pickup.", "Brett Feldman", "Alright, thank you.", "Lowell McAdam", "Brad, let's take the next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Barden of Bank of America. You may ask your question.", "David Barden", "Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. Just maybe a couple of quick clarifications from Matt and one for Lowell. Matt, so just following up on that EPS guide to be clear, the low single-digit guidance does include the benefit from the change in the accounting for the handset related selling costs. And just to clarify that.", "And then the second on the cash flow guidance, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion cash flow benefit, is that a sequential year-over-year benefit or is that a benefit relative to what you're expecting to pay in cash taxes in 2018. And then Lowell, if I could just ask, you've done a number of things on fiber both organic builds in terms of Boston for instance, acquisitions of XO and then more creative partnerships like on the WOW front.", "Can you kind of talk a little about as we look into '18, '19, kind of the path forward on fiber infrastructure in supporting the 5G build. Is it more of an organic game plan from here on out or are they still on ways to make acquisitions on that front? Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks, David. So, your second question to me the cash flow guide, the $3.5 billion to $4.0 billion that is compared to what our 2018 cash taxes would have been without tax reform. So, it's not a comparison against 2017's cash taxes. It's just the 2018 impact with and without tax reform.", "On the EPS guide, maybe I'll try to say in this little clearer. The EPS guide is our view on the business without revenue recognition and without tax reform. So, then you lay on top of that number, the impact of revenue recognition that we gave in the AK last week and you also lay on top the $0.55 to $0.65 increase in EPS that I described in the prepared remarks earlier this morning.", "So, hopefully that does that help clear up the EPS question?", "David Barden", "Sorry, Matt. Because the revenue recognition is one thing but there is an expense recognition change, that's a separate thing that's a benefit between $900 million and $1.2 billion.", "Matthew Ellis", "Right.", "David Barden", "And I was just wondering if that's included in the single-digit or not included in the single-digit?", "Matthew Ellis", "It is not included in the single-digit, you add it on to the single-digit guidance.", "David Barden", "Perfect, thank you.", "Lowell McAdam", "Okay. Then David, so your question kind of boils down to or is it organic or is it M&A and where do we see deploying fiber. So, just for everyone else on the call, we have done some M&A. XO had a fair amount of fiber and WideOpenWest had fiber that we did by M&A.", "But we also announced our deal with Corning, which is a multi-year deal where we're doing 12.5 million miles of fiber per year for the next three years. So, that would tell you we're sort of tilting toward organic. And our priorities are really what can we do to get off of others lease services to meet our 4G cell densification needs, then 5G, and then our enterprise customers.", "And we're out in markets now obviously placing fiber but it's a market-by-market analysis of the three factors that I just talked about. And frankly, the cities the meeting that we're having with the cities and what access they will give us to street furniture and conduit and those sorts of things factor into the equation.", "So, it's a bit fluid at this point and I wouldn\u2019t tell you that if an opportunity came up to accelerate it through M&A, we would do it, but most of the fiber companies were built for different purposes. They were point-to-point enterprise sort of services and they don\u2019t fit the architecture that we're building today which is multi-use fiber for Intelligent Edge Network.", "So, and I hope that's clear enough for you but certainly leaning toward organic builds to meet Verizon needs to drive our cost down in our performance up.", "David Barden", "Thanks guys, I appreciate it.", "Lowell McAdam", "Brad, we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Rollins of Citi Research. Your line is open.", "Michael Rollins", "Hi, good morning. Question for Matt as well as a question for Lowell. First Matt, can you talk about the strength in wireless phone that adds in the fourth quarter in a bit more detail and can you also describe what you're seeing from two of the changes in the competitive over the past 12 months which is cable starting to sell wireless subscription and also some of your competitors bundling in video services.", "And Lowell, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the vision at Verizon. As you look at what you're investing in the mobile business, fiber infrastructure, 5G, is there a broader vision inside the company that you want to provide broadband access to as many premises as well as mobile customers across the country?", "And is there some vision of what proportion of the country you may be able to reach in three to five years as you take all of these things together that you're dealing as a company? Thanks.", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks, Mike. So, I'll start off with the wireless front question and then Lowell can get onto fiber. Look, we had a great year on the wireless performance. The net ads were very strong as I mentioned, our smartphone net ads at 1.8 million for the year up 34% year-over-year.", "So, we really saw a significant change. Today we launched unlimited back in February of last year and from that point forward, we have competed very effectively in the marketplace and it really allow customers to have a similar currency to compare different carriers on and the value proposition is resonating.", "And despite all the noise that you hear from other people and the claims you hear from other people, the network quality matters. We saw that numerous times throughout the year and we see that in the performance we had on net ads whether it be the new activations coming in or the churn that we'd had.", "So, each of the last three quarters of the year, phone churn was below 0.8% and I think that tells you how much customers enjoy being on the Verizon network. So, you ask about the game of source. Look, we're happy of what we've seen so far. Obviously, Comcast is on and Charter has said they expect to be on later this year.", "And as we say consistently we like those agreements and we signed them in 2011 and we're happy to be doing them today. And we'll see how they play out but everything we've seen so far is in line with our expectations and we're glad to have that traffic on that network and monetize in that traffic based on what those companies are doing with those agreements.", "And in terms of what the competitors are doing. Look, they bundle a number of things into their services during the course of last year and our numbers have staid very consistent. So, at the end of the day, the quality of the network that the device is on is of fundamental importance. And overall, when you look at our value proposition, it continues to resonate strongly.", "And let's say we're very happy with the results we had last year and starting off 2018 on the [front foot].", "Lowell McAdam", "Okay Mike, let me take where we want to have from infrastructure in a vision perspective. Look, I think it's very clear here whether you look at what's going on today with customers or what you're anticipating that you saw at CES and others from what's next that there is an insatiable demand for broadband.", "And it's not mobile and it's not fixed. It, customers don\u2019t care and I think who wins is going to be able to provide them the service that they can move seamlessly from fixed to mobile. We have been a much stronger mobile company over the years but the way we're positioning our fiber deployment and the way we're positioning 5G, we will be able to disregard geography and deploy those broadband services at a much lower cost than we've ever seen at least during my career.", "Now for us to complete the vision, you need to be able to provide sort of those internet information services and video drives an awful lot of that. And we talked at length about taking the Oath assets to be that information source around news boards, finance and entertainment and lifestyle. And we think that the assets that we have will provide what customers need.", "So, and you look at the applications going forward, they will whether it's medical and healthcare services, whether it's smart cities, whether it's education, whether it's autonomous cars and transportation systems, you're going to need that sort of seamless high bandwidth. And we lump that under the title human ability.", "So, our focus is around giving all of our customers the capabilities to embrace these applications, so the future that are going to make their lives so much better. And so our investments they are all about providing the assets in the platforms to deliver that.", "Michael Rollins", "Thanks, very much.", "Lowell McAdam", "Brad, let's take the next question, please.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Craig Moffett of MoffettNathanson. You may go ahead with your question.", "Craig Moffett", "Hi, good morning. A question about your capital budgeting process in the light of tax reform. Just given that the returns on a whole range of projects will now have been boosted by both the lower tax rate and the accelerated depreciation. Does that change your priorities with respect to capital investment or are there some specific types of projects whether it's deploying fiber or that sort of thing that now pops in front of the queue as being meaningfully more attractive than they were.", "And how should we think about that with respect to the total size of your capital budget going forward?", "Lowell McAdam", "Well Craig, I'll take that and then Matt can jump in. I guess you could accuse us of being boring but you at least should give us credit for being consistent.", "We have been extremely disciplined and then when we see an opportunity, we go hard. And you saw that in 3G, you saw that in 4G and you're going to see it and you're seeing it in 5G in placing fiber. We see a real opportunity here. We were the ones that stood up and said two years ago when everybody said we are way too early but we've been deliberate about it.", "We've gone out, we've done the field trials, we've developed the ecosystem, we worked with partners from Korea as well as the infrastructure providers were out there as I said with 200 sale sites today learning and we're going to see what commercially happens in these three to five cities. Then we'll make the decision.", "So, to us it's a very inconsistent that just because tax reform comes through, we're all of a sudden going to draw the line at a different place or lose that discipline. What tax reform does do is it gives us great flexibility that once we prove to ourselves that we can get a reasonable return on invested capital, we can accelerate very rapidly. And that gets the match point about we want to early on strengthen that balance sheet to give us the flexibility.", "But the strategies there and we are all sort of like a spring ready to expand very quickly if we need to. But we have to get through another couple of hurdles here before we make those decisions and we're not ready to say that in January of '18 but I certainly hope by fourth quarter results next year we're accelerating because we've got such a great story to tell.", "Matthew Ellis", "The only other thing I'd add to that, Craig, and I'd kind of come back to the comments that Hans Vestberg made earlier this month that \"In our Industry, the nature of the way that we spend money, having significant increases and decreases is in a fashion the way we deploy CapEx.\" So, we're certainly looking at given as you say tax reform can change that some of the return math, but we'll be methodical about it.", "And there's a lot of planning that goes into our capital spending before we get to it. And so, that's why you see us making the comments we do. We certainly look forward having the right opportunities in front of us. But you will us do it methodically and do it in the way that creates the greatest value.", "Craig Moffett", "Thanks.", "Lowell McAdam", "Brad, we're ready for the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jennifer Fritzsch of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Fritzsch", "Okay. Thank you for taking the question. Two, if I may. One, the inevitable spectrum question. With T Mobile\u2019s purchases in the broadcast [auction] may have I think two times the amount of low band spectrum. Well, you have a kind of millimeter way spectrum, some may say or as might say as how the eggs are in that basket. How do you think of that?", "And then second if I could get some math around David's question earlier. You mentioned moving away from leases, can you quantify how much right now you're paying them back house to them about cyber providers same class?", "Lowell McAdam", "Why don\u2019t I take the spectrum question? As you say, Jennifer, \"the inevitable question.\" Look, there is going to be an awful lot of noise around deployment of 5G. If you recall back when we deployed 4G, there was a big scramble for everybody to try to get 3G to look like 4G and we called it 4G Faux. And you're seeing some of the same stuff right now.", "In order to do 5G and this is right out of the standard which we certainly agree with, you need at least a 100 megahertz of bandwidth to provide the latency, the reliability, the throughputs that really are the 5G promise. I can take 5G and I can put it on 10 megahertz of PCS if I want to. It won't perform like 5G, it will be the technology but it won't have the reliability, it won't have the throughput and it won't have the latency.", "So, you're going to get a lot of this, well they need this or they are depending on whether your selling spectrum or what you've got in your basket of spectrum today. But I wouldn\u2019t change positions with anybody out there. I've got plenty of low band spectrum that works great for 4G, it's going to serve us for years to come.", "But in order to put all of the aspects of 5G into play, you need 100s of megahertz of bandwidth. The only one who has that in a big way in the market place is us.", "Matthew Ellis", "And so, I'll just add one other piece to that, I agree exact low set about 5G and you should think about 4G network. We've always said these three things. Spectrum is a densification in the architecture and then the technology. I can tell you over the past few months there's been a number of technology upgrades to the network and you will see in that in the network performance a number of those we deployed in the back end of the fourth quarter, so significant amount of additional capacity being added to the network as we head into '18, again without having to go acquire additional spectrum.", "But I do expect you to ask that question on those who's going forward. It would be a kind of a miss if people didn't. In terms of your question on how much we are paying back on fiber end, that's not a number we disclose. We really don't break out the income statement by individual line items, we're not going to start doing that now. But I would just say as we think about fiber, we look at the most economic way of getting it irrespective of where it shows up in the financial statements and we'll continue to do that.", "Jennifer Fritzsch", "Thank you.", "Lowell McAdam", "Hey Brad, we have time for one more question, please.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Amir Rozwadowski of Barclays. You may ask your question.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thanks, very much. Late last year, Lowell, you had highlighted a goal for $10 billion in cost cuts over the next few years. I was wondering how should we think about the areas where you believe the biggest opportunities for cost reductions are and how should we think about those cost cuts filtering in through the company over the next couple of years?", "And then secondly, I was wondering if going back to the 5G topic, if you can touch upon whether you believe that fiber will be a competitive advantage in this world. Clearly you folks are making a significant amount of investment to get the necessary densification capillarity that you need for fiber. Others seemed to be working with cable providers to improve densification and back haul, do you believe that this is a viable alternative versus what you guys are doing or do you believe that at this point in time you are setting the stage for a longer term competitive mode as 5G comes to commercial positioning?", "Matthew Ellis", "Thanks, Amir. Let me take the first one on the $10 billion number over the next four years that Lowell mentioned in September and we have talked about little since then. Look, what every area of the business is where we're looking and we believe that there is opportunities across every area of the business. Obviously network; cost are significant part, distribution; is something we're taking a close look at customer care or the back office type activities.", "Essentially there is no area of the business it isn't going to get examined as part of this exercise because this imperative we make sure that we're as efficient a company as we can be as we go forward. From a timing standpoint, I can tell you we've embedded the 2018 targets for this activity in each of the business units operating plans for the year. And I look forward to discussing the results that we achieved on this as we go forward in '18 and into the future.", "Lowell McAdam", "And then Amir, I guess my answer on the fiber competitive advantage is, throughout my career I have always believed and it's been reinforced many times that if you've got a critical component of your success, you better own it and control it. And that fits with our direct distribution, it fits with a lot of our customer service. We don't outsource sales. We certainly wouldn't outsource critical components of our network.", "As Hans has come in and put in our architecture for Intelligent Edge, owning that fiber asset is important to our financial performance as well as the performance of the network. And as we've seen time-and-time again, network competitive advantage drives customers which ultimately drives financial. So, you won't see us outsource much in the way of network unless someone has a huge scale advantage and we could negotiate very strong performance and very consistent financials that would go along with it.", "Amir Rozwadowski", "Thank you very much for the incremental color.", "Brady Connor", "That's all the time we have for questions. Before we end the call, I would like to turn it back over to Lowell for some closing comments.", "Lowell McAdam", "Thanks, Brady. So just a couple of final points from me. I don't come on these calls very often. I like to save that for when we've got significant changes in the business. And obviously, tax reform and our use of those funds was important for us to clarify.", "But there was a second reason for me to come on and I have been in this industry for 30 years and I think we're breaking into one of the most exciting times that I've seen in my career. We are on the cusp of what I call the fourth industrial revolution as we see smart city applications, the changes in medical, the changes in transportation and education; all of those are fueled by a strong telecommunications infrastructure.", "So, I think this is a great time for our industry overall. Obviously, I think Verizon is the best positioned to deliver that future. We've had a long history of strong operational and financial performance. We're investing in the media platforms and the fiber assets and the network and in the new technologies to meet the needs that are coming forward.", "And I think as I said that will be a major change in the way people live, work and play. So, I am very excited about 2018, what lies ahead for us. I look forward to sharing the results and the successes as we move forward in this year and coming on a call next year at this time and recapping one of the best years in our history.", "So, with that we'll close the call and we appreciate all of your time today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.
