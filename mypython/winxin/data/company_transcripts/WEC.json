Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's Conference Call to Review 2015 First Quarter Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today.", "And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results.", "Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.", "Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share for the first quarter of 2015. This compares with earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter last year. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.04 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group.", "Well, the story of the first quarter was our cold winter weather. Though not nearly as extreme as the weather that gripped our region last year, temperatures were almost 12% colder than normal, driving strong customer demand for natural gas. In fact, during February, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers than during any other February in our history, exceeding last year's record by 5.5%.", "I'm also pleased to report that our natural gas distribution networks performed exceptionally well, underscoring the benefit to customers of our Deliver the Future program. You may recall that as part of Deliver the Future, we're accelerating the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines, the lines that are most susceptible to stress during severe weather.", "Turning now to the state of the economy, the Wisconsin unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in March. That's the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008 and is nearly a full percentage point better than the national average of 5.5%. Wisconsin added more than 48,000 private sector jobs between March of 2014 and March of 2015. And as the economy continues to improve, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers improved as well, rising by 0.6% in the first quarter.", "Sectors that showed particular strength included plastics, printing and food processing. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Through early May, new electric service connections are up almost 19% and new natural gas installations are up nearly 14% compared to the same time period last year.", "Now, later in my remarks, I'll update you on other developments in our core business, and the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23 last year, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Our analysis shows that combining the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group meets or exceeds all three criteria that we use to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities.", "First, we believe the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Of course, that would be 2016. Second, we believe it will be largely credit neutral. And finally, we believe the long-term growth rate will be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We expect the combined company will grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either of us is projecting on a standalone basis with more than 99% of those earnings coming from regulated businesses.", "Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity. And over time, we'll enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our company by incorporating best practices system-wide. We believe that customers could actually see as much as $1 billion of savings over the next 10 years through a combination of lower capital and operating costs in Wisconsin.", "In addition, Integrys today, as you may recall, owns a 34.1% interest in American Transmission Company. Wisconsin Energy owns 26.2%. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest independent transmission companies in the United States.", "ATC has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region that calls for an investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion by the year 2023. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.", "So where do we stand in getting the regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Integrys? Again to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders last November. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in October of last year with no further action required by the company.", "Just a few weeks ago on April 7, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the transaction to be in the public interest and issued an order with no conditions other than those we proposed. Then on April 13, the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of certain communication licenses. So all federal approvals for the transaction are now complete.", "Turning to the state proceedings, the Michigan Commission issued its approval on April 23 and the Wisconsin Commission voted to approve the transaction at its open meeting on April 30, determining the transaction to be in the best interest of utility customers, stockholders and the public. The Wisconsin Commission applied several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that we share with customers for a three-year period beginning in 2016 any earnings at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas that are above our allowed rates of return.", "In addition, Wisconsin Public Service, the Integrys utility based in Green Bay, will not be allowed to build a new natural gas-fired generating unit unless a study of the joint needs of all our companies determines a need for new capacity. We expect to receive a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission by the end of May. In Minnesota, the commission there is expected to review our application during May and the schedule for the Illinois Commerce Commission calls for a decision no later than July 6.", "In summary, we're making excellent progress on all regulatory fronts and we anticipate closing the transaction now by the end of this summer.", "Now, before we discuss the status of our ongoing construction projects, I'd also like to take just a moment to follow up on the settlement agreement in Michigan. As we discussed during our previous calls, we've been working toward a long-term electric reliability solution for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, in cooperation with the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan Commission staff, and iron ore mines.", "We reached an agreement on March 12 that replaced the original arrangement we had announced in January. The revised agreement includes the following important elements. First, Wisconsin Electric will retain ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant and our current electric distribution (8:40) assets. The iron ore mines have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power from Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Energy then expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and/or purchase power from the new facility. This will allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Plant.", "And finally, Wisconsin Energy would potentially create a separate Michigan-only utility. If formed, our electric customers residing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would become part of this utility and the utility would be a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. Overall, we're very pleased with this result.", "And now turning to recent developments in our core business. As you may recall, last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral, which will span an 85 mile route through Western and Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region of the state. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and demand from the sand mining industry.", "The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. We began work last October on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the three branch lines were installed by mid November. Construction of the third branch line began in January and is now nearing completion. Route clearing for the final large diameter lateral is now complete. Construction on the regulator stations is on schedule and 100% of the large diameter steel pipe has been delivered to our work yards. We are on time, we are on budget and we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we are converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The two unit Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menominee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and also provides important voltage support for the electric network.", "The Valley conversion project achieved another milestone on April 10, that's when unit two started its coal to gas conversion outage and the Valley Power Plant stopped burning coal after more than 46 years. Unit two should be completed by early fall in time for the next heating season. Unit one, of course, achieved commercial operation burning natural gas last November. Overall, the Valley project is more than 70% complete. We expect the total cost to range between $65 million and $70 million again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts.", "Now, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls Hydroelectric Plant, located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls was built back in the day in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. Construction began in late 2013 to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Construction activities have now resumed at Twin Falls after a planned break for the winter. We continue to make good progress on all the major construction work. The upstream cofferdam is finished, rock excavation is roughly 90% complete, and overall the project is on time and on budget with approximately 42% of the work now finished.", "We will begin physical construction of the new powerhouse later this spring, and we expect to achieve commercial operation in the summer of 2016. We're forecasting the total investment at $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend.", "So, after receiving the necessary environmental approvals, we began making changes to the boilers and testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. We have actually conducted limited testing on unit two at levels of up to a 100% PRB. Although, the testing has gone very well, there are operational issues that need to be addressed and equipment that must be modified. So, last July, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending to modify the plant. Our share of that investment would be $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends of up to 100% PRB.", "We also need space on equipment to handle additional coal inventory on the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission last October for an expanded cold storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our share of the estimated capital cost for this project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval from both of these initiatives this summer.", "Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion for a five-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10-year capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024.", "Turning now to our dividend policy, our current standalone policy targets a dividend payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a policy that's more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend for Wisconsin Energy stockholders by 7% to 8% to achieve parity with the Integrys shareholders. Going forward, the payout target for the combined company is projected to be at 65% to 70% of earnings.", "In conclusion, we're off to a strong start both financially and operationally in 2015 and we're pleased with the progress we've made as we work to finalize our acquisition of Integrys.", "And now, for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our two business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.", "Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $358.8 million as compared to $381.08 million in 2014. That's a decrease of $23 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $276.5 million for 2015, a decrease of $16.2 million from the first quarter of 2014. On the favorable side, we estimate that our operating income increased by $14.7 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case.", "On the downside, we estimate that our gas and electric margins decreased by $20.6 million because of the weather. As Gale mentioned earlier, the first quarter of 2015 was cold. Our heating degree days were up almost 12% as compared to normal. However, heating degree days last year were 24% higher than normal due to the polar vortex. In addition, our depreciation expense increased by $4.3 million due to additional capital placed into service.", "Operating income in the Non-Utility segment was up $1.4 million when compared to 2014. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our Corporate and Other segment showed an operating loss of $9.3 million this quarter as compared to $1.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is directly driven by costs associated with the acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at the $23 million decline in operating income.", "During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.1 million, a slight decline from the same period last year. This decline was in line with our expectations, and is directly related to an anticipated reduction and authorized returns for transmission companies.", "Our other income net increased by $1.9 million, largely because of higher AFUDC. AFUDC increased primarily because of our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates. Last year, we replaced maturing debt with new debt at lower rates. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $7.9 million because of lower pre-tax earnings. Our effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to be between 37% and 38%.", "Combining all of these items brings you to $195.8 million of net income for the first quarter of 2015, or earnings of $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings which exclude $0.04 of acquisition related costs were $0.90 per share.", "During the first quarter of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $329.7 million, which is $55.4 million less than 2014. In January, we contributed $100 million to our pension trust, which reduced operating cash flows. No contributions were made in 2014. Our capital expenditures totaled $149.5 million in the first quarter, a $20.3 million increase compared to 2014. The largest increase was related to the gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin.", "Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.6% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares except of course for those shares in connection with the acquisition of Integrys.", "We also paid $95.3 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of $7.2 million over the first quarter last year. Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 0.7% in the first quarter 2015, as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 2.4%.", "Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.1%. Actual residential deliveries fell 7.1%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries were flat with last year. Actual deliveries fell by 1.2%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2015 were up by 0.6%. If you exclude the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.5%.", "Our first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, improved by 2.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.8% compared to the polar-vortex-driven gas sales in last year's first quarter. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter are in line with our expectations for the year.", "Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We're off to a strong start, but we still have nine more months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share.", "Finally, let's take a look at second quarter guidance. Last year's second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Last year's second quarter earnings were buoyed by a favorable O&M cost and lower benefits costs. This year, our maintenance schedule calls for more work in the second quarter than we performed last year.", "In addition, our April weather this year was much milder than last year. Taking these factors into account, we expect our second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes transaction-related costs. Once again, our second quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.54 to $0.56 a share.", "And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks much, Pat. Overall, we are solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And now, we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Greg. How are you?", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Hey, Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "How you doing?", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "I have two questions. The first one is how do you feel about the Packers draft?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "My summation of that is the Jets still suck.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Fair enough. Fair enough. Probably true. Can you talk about the sales growth in the first quarter in the context of you still feeling like you are on track for the year? I know \u2013 because the residential weather-normal demand was down 3.1%.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Is that just sort of maybe a statistical issue or do you expect that to reverse later in the year? That's my main question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good question, Greg. The short answer is, yeah, I do think that the first quarter residential weather-normal numbers are a statistical anomaly. You've heard me say this before, but the weather-normalization techniques that are available to companies like ours, they simply break down when you get two to three standard deviations off the norm. And last year, with the polar vortex, particularly as it hit the Midwest and Wisconsin, I mean we were way, way off the norm. So, I honestly don't put much stock in the weather-normal numbers for the first quarter.", "On the other hand, if you look at our large commercial and industrial segment, which is far less weather sensitive, you saw an uptick of 0.6% even compared to the polar vortex numbers of a year ago. So, as we've looked at this and believe me, we have analyzed this about 14 ways to Sunday, our bottom line conclusion is we are on track overall for what we expected for the year. And we weren't expecting, as you know, significant uptick in kilowatt hour sales. So we feel pretty good about where we stand. And again, I would take with a grain of salt the weather-normal numbers when you compare it to such an extraordinary period a year ago. Hope that helps, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Yes, thank you very much. When you talk to your industrial and commercial customers about their planned economic activity for the next 12 months, I know you do a lot of economic development and you stay very close to those...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We do.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "...those customers. What is the tenor of \u2013 their mood about capital investment, hiring and the outlook?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say \u2013 and let me answer that in two ways. From the standpoint of commercial development, downtown office towers, retail centers being developed, we're seeing more commercial development than I think we've seen in the entire decade that I have been in this region. So our commercial customers, I would say, are showing just very solid optimism. Our industrial customers are, I would say, much more cautiously optimistic, nothing that would show huge growth, but on the other hand, I would say steady as she goes from the general input we're getting from our industrial customers.", "And then, of course, we should see an interesting development in the second quarter. You may recall me mentioning that Amazon has built a 1 million square foot, it's huge, a 1 million square foot distribution center south of Milwaukee and north of the Illinois line, that construction is complete. They're hiring and we should see that that 1 million square foot facility and a lot of ancillary development opening this summer.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks very much, Gale. Have a good day.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You take care, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "How you doing, Julien?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon to you.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Excellent. So, first question here more on the balance sheet side of the equation. In terms of your pro forma metrics for the transaction, how do you see yourself trending within your targeted ranges? And ultimately as you see yourself more structurally what kind of metrics are you targeting pro forma, just perhaps with respect to your rating (27:40) but also even within that kind of the FFO metrics, if you will?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me start out by framing our overall objective, and then we can talk through some of the more specifics. Our overall objective, remember, going back to one of our three most important criteria for acquisitions would be that we would maintain largely credit neutrality for the acquisition. We would fully expect based on the input we're receiving from the credit rating agencies to maintain our A category credit rating. So that basically, fundamentally, where we expect to stay, and where we have planned to stay.", "And then of course, as you know, the agencies have very specific debt to total cap and FFO metrics tied to being in \u2013 being \u2013 qualifying to stay in that credit rating, but we would expect very much to stay within the A category credit rating. Current thinking, of course, is unchanged related to the amount of debt at the holding company that we would add for the acquisition. Right now, we are still projecting about $1.5 billion of debt at the holding company to complete the acquisition and that would be, Pat, in 3-year, 5-year and 10-year tranches.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Correct, Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And equally spread across the tranches.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So that's basically my general response to that. Perhaps Scott, Allen, anything you want to add?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Julien, was there something more specific you were after?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Well, I was just wondering where within those metrics \u2013 I mean how much pressure, you talk about maintaining largely credit neutrality, but just how much pressure probably at the lower end of that range within the FFO?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Let me try it this way. The one thing that when we talked to the rating agencies almost a year ago now, there is nothing going on at the utilities, so the only activity we focused on and they focused on was at the holding company. And you may have seen \u2013 let's use Moody's as an example. In June of 2014, I believe we were \u2013 outlook was down...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Negative outlook.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Negative outlook, and then this morning they announced that we were on...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Negative watch.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, negative watch. That's all consistent. So I mean, in that, when we first went in and said we're going to put $1.5 billion acquisition down in the holding company, they said okay, that's what we think in June. Now, the triggering event was the Wisconsin Commission approval and now we took the next step. So, fairly consistent. I don't know I can get any more specific than that.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got you. Hey, no worries. Thank you. And then just in terms of execution of the transaction, I know it's a little early here, but can you talk a little bit to the best practices and just ability to kind of, how should we say, turn around the Peoples Gas business and opportunity set there? I don't want to get too close to the synergies per se, but just kind of more qualitative, if you will.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I appreciate the questions, Julien, and I think very simply, let me start off with basically our overall mission statement. Once we complete the acquisition, we intend to function as one company, one team with seven customer facing brands, all focused on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. That's basically the mantra, the mission, and how we will go about achieving the important objectives that we've laid out for the transaction including meeting all three of the criteria that we continue to talk about is the criteria that we use for any acquisition opportunity. As you probably have read specifically related to your question on Peoples Gas, we were asked by the Illinois Commerce Commission what our plans would be for management of Peoples Gas and we responded to the Illinois Commission in writing committing that we would essentially place a minimum of three new senior officers from our team at Peoples Gas. So that will be one of the first steps that we will take immediately following the acquisition. We will put a very experienced professional, solid management team in place at People Gas. We're going to find, we know this already some very talented people in the operational ranks with Peoples Gas. So I think we're going to have a really solid team from day one at Peoples Gas and the Peoples Gas organization will report directly to me.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And then lastly \u2013 were you saying something?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Obviously, I hope that gives you a flavor.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Absolutely. Just the last little detail. In terms of the timeline for closing you said late summer if I have it right. Is there any...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we said by the end of the summer.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got you. Just in terms of the ICC schedule, is there any reason to think that it couldn't close earlier if you look at it at present?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if we look at it at present, the Illinois Commerce Commission with the regulations and procedures that they follow in a case like this by statute unless there is some decision to delay, the Illinois Commerce Commission would make a decision by no later than July 6.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And then you would close very shortly thereafter in theory?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Once we receive the final approval, we'll close probably within three business days.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Just checking on the verbiage there. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome. Thank you, Julien.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Steve, how are you today?", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, Gale, how are you?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm good.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "That's good. So just on the Illinois approval, it sounds like they kept the timeline despite some parties concerned about this investigation going on at the \u2013 one of Peoples Gas's programs. Could you just talk about that? And I guess maybe more importantly just how you've gotten comfortable that that is not an issue?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. I'd be happy to, Steve. Well, first of all, just to explain the procedure with the Illinois Commerce Commission. The State Attorney General in Illinois filed a motion with the administrative law judge that is presiding over our merger case, petitioning the administrative law judge to, in essence, delay a ICC decision on our merger from the statutory deadline of July 6 for an additional 90 days, while the review continues on the management of the advanced main replacement program that Peoples Gas is undertaking. Both we and Integrys felt that a delay was not necessary, because there's a separate docket where the Illinois Commerce Commission is reviewing any concern and reviewing the manner in which the gas main replacement program has been managed. So there's a separate docket underway that will probably go on for a number of months.", "The administrative law judge determined that a delay was simply not necessary and ruled in favor of no delay, the commission staff also suggested no delay. So at the moment, there would be nothing on the table that would postpone a decision by July 6. So I hope that's helpful on the scheduling standpoint.", "In terms of the review of the \u2013 what's called AMRP, the advanced main replacement program, the Illinois Commerce Commission had already authorized an independent audit, if you will, of how People's is managing that construction program. And of course, that construction program, as you know, is very extensive. It will last probably at least for a 10-year period. The legislation actually covers the 10-year period in Illinois for the replacement of aging gas pipes in the City of Chicago. Some of those pipes, by the way, are Civil War era pipes, and really do badly need replacing. So long story short, there already was an external audit going on of the AMRP program and how it's been managed. That audit is well along an interim report. There is an auditing firm called Liberty and the Liberty report \u2013 the interim report is out and has been shared with us and we would expect, Allen, a final Liberty report I would assume within the next 30 days to 45 days.", "Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation", "There is a draft that's already out...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation", "...of the final report.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, we have obviously been able to review all of the recommendations and all of the findings in the audit, both the interim findings and now the draft final review findings. And, Steve, that's how we're comfortable that that this program is manageable and it's certainly needed from the standpoint of upgraded infrastructure.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then just to clarify, in Wisconsin and the way the sharing works, my understanding is that above your ROE you share 50/50 for the first 50 basis points and then above that level earnings would be used to pay down this deferral balance?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Is that essentially how this works?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That is correct. We have a number of transmission costs that have been deferred on our balance sheet, that's we call it the transmission escrow. And what the commission has asked us to do, as you say correctly, above our authorized rates of return at Wisconsin Electric, which is 10.2 right now on that retail utility. So the first 50 basis points that we might earn in any years 2016, 2017 or 2018 above the 10.2, we would share with customers 50/50, stockholders would keep 50%. The customer would receive the benefit through paying down the transmission escrow.", "Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Rock and roll, Brian, how are you?", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good, thank you. Actually all my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Can you think of a new question that hasn't been asked or answered, Paul?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I have got a handful of them, thanks.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good for you. All right. Give us your best shot here, Paul.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Pat, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly that the lower transmission was a function of the fact you are booking to a lower ROE?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's correct. We are...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's correct.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And are you disclosing that ROE?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We've taken our best shot in the zone of reasonableness and we invite you to do the same.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And the merger costs showed up on the O&M line on the income statement, all of them?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That is correct.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So net-net, excluding those, O&M was actually down for the quarter. What drove that?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Actually, you are absolutely correct. O&M was down for the quarter on an ongoing operational basis and it was really effective cost controls across virtually every part of our organization. It's not just one thing, but it clearly was very good cost control across, literally, every organization.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And absent outage timing, should that continue through the year?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We will see. I will say one thing. We did benefit, for example, on the gas distribution side of our business. We had \u2013 even with the colder than normal weather, we had materially fewer gas leaks to respond to this year and that's I think a direct benefit from the investments we've been making in our gas distribution network. So, the fact that we wouldn't experience severe weather in the next two quarters might mean that we don't see those kind of O&M savings on the gas side of our business. But by and large, I mean, our folks have just done a tremendous job of managing effectively from the standpoint of cost control.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then I think when you gave initial guidance, Presque Isle was still getting SSR payments. How has the turn of events kind of changed \u2013 how does that play into guidance?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it doesn't play into guidance. We are no longer receiving SSR payments, but it doesn't play into guidance because the way rates were set at the end of 2014, in essence, the revenues, the margins from any sales to the mines, which have now basically stepped back into a power sales arrangement with us, any revenues and margins from those sales would really go to \u2013 go into escrow for dealing in the next \u2013 for treatment in the next rate case. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation", "Right. And then you also escrow for SSR revenues.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation", "So, what Gale was explaining is that they made an assumption about SSR revenues. And to the extent that SSR revenues in this case are less, you book an escrow item. And then to the extent we get margin from the mines, you escrow that as well. So, it just all goes up on the balance sheet and there really is no income statement impact.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right. So, on the balance sheet, it's like Ragu, it's in there.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. And then kind of relative to 1Q guidance, I think you beat the midpoint by $0.10. Can you kind of explain where that came from?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, basically \u2013 and I'll frame it and Pat can give you some more specifics, but essentially, there are a couple of drivers. One would be \u2013 in terms of our guidance, one would be the colder weather that drove stronger gas and electric margins than we had anticipated in the budget; and the second is largely O&M control. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Right. I'll just put a little color to that, Paul. I agree completely with Gale. Weather was roughly $0.05 better than what we thought versus the guidance, and O&M was roughly $0.03 better. And again the best example of that, as Gale mentioned, was the gas expense for leaks.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Sounds good. Thank you very much.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Terrific. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon, Caroline. How are you doing?", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good. Good afternoon. I was just curious if you could remind us what base year you are using when guiding to the 5% to 7% EPS CAGR for the pro forma company.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the 5% to 7% combined company EPS projection really would be off of the year 2015.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's great. And then also a minor question here, but what should we expect transaction costs to be for the full year in 2015?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it depends upon how well Susan Martin controls our attorneys. And so far, that ain't so good. No, actually our attorneys have done very, very good work obviously and we're very much on schedule in terms of all the approval process. I'm looking at Pat to see if you have a total for this year only.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. For this year only, about $20 million to $30 million and that's...", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That's just the out-of-pocket lawyers and bankers. That's not all the other stuff that goes around change of control, et cetera.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That is \u2013 Pat is correct. That's the out-of-pocket expenses, legal fees, investment banking fees, expert witness fees, other outside consultant fees that are required as we work through the regulatory process.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you. Just one more minor one. In your earnings package you guys talked about rate cases adding $14.7 million versus last year. Is that kind of a good run rate assumption for the rest of the year in each quarter in terms of the benefit?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I would not use that as a run rate. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think this quarter is going to be a little higher.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And the reason for that is if you look back at 2014, January, we did not collect SSR. So that delta is going to be higher. In this quarter, so \u2013 then running out will be the same. So whatever you see in Q2 might be a good prediction, but one is a little high.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Caroline.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Michael, do you have any more of those blue things we drank one night?", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "No. I have not. That's a good idea. It's been a while. It's been a couple of years. We should catch up on that if we can find that place.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Exactly.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Two questions. One, really a little bit of a follow-up on Caroline's one. Can you remind us what were the rate increases \u2013 base rate increases granted in 2015 by the PSC for both WEPCO and WG?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We didn't \u2013 have got the specific numbers here with us and we're going to ask Scott Lauber or Pat to give you that. Overall, when you take into account a fuel cost reduction that we were able to put into rates (45:05), overall, our electric rates are only up about 0.1%, but it differs between customer segments. Scott?", "Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President", "Yeah. That's correct. So, Wisconsin Electric is just up a small 0.1%; if you put the fuel and it's actually down about 0.4%; and if you look at Wisconsin Gas, it was up about 2.6% on the margin.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, my apologies, I may have asked the question poorly. I recall that there was a base rate increase at WEPCO for this year?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "There was.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Can you just \u2013 let's leave fuel out of the equation, I'm just trying to think about base rates.", "Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President", "Yeah, the base rates were up were 0.1%, but remember, we're giving about 0.5% back as a credit this year and that credit was really like a base rate, it increase also.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, a long story short, I would use 0.1%.", "Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President", "That's what the customers are seeing.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, the customers for base rates are seeing 0.1%.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. So, on an annualized basis I'm just trying to get to a rough dollar millions number here, okay? I just wanted to sanity check that, because I don't know why I thought it was somewhere in kind of the $30 million to $45 million for WEPCO.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Because you're probably not far off.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, that's fine. I can follow up offline. Second, on \u2013 when you look at your businesses, electric and gas utilities, do you see when you kind of look out too hard to predict 10 years down the road, but next two years to three years, two years to four years, one side of the business growing faster than the other, meaning electric growing faster than gas or maybe something we haven't seen in a long time, gas growing faster than electric?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if I were a betting man, I would project that we would see gas \u2013 our gas distribution business growing slightly faster than our electric business for a couple of reasons. One, clearly, just the low price of natural gas; and secondly, the opportunity that we have to continue to gain customers through switching from propane to natural gas. You may have heard me say this before, but the national statistics from a year ago would indicate that Wisconsin is one of the five heaviest using propane states in the United States. And I think there is a tremendous opportunity for customer growth. Forget about per usage customer for a minute, but I think there is a tremendous opportunity for customer growth as we continue to see customers wanting to switch to our natural gas distribution network. In fact, I mentioned in the script, the uptick in customer growth that we are seeing and it's double-digit so far this year compared to the uptick we saw even last year. So to make a long story short, if I were a betting man, I would say, gas grows faster than electric by a bit over the next four years to five years.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And can you frame for us what percentage of the potential kind of addressable market is actually using propane versus natural gas in Wisconsin?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The last number I saw, but please don't hold me to this, was that there were a couple of \u2013 somewhere between 220,000 and 250,000 propane users still in the state. Now many of them are in rural areas, where there is not a strong natural gas distribution networks. I don't want to mislead you that a quarter of a million customers could automatically just switch tomorrow to natural gas. But it gives you a sense of what the longer term prospects might look like.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And finally on electric transmission, you are booking a lower ROE, this isn't a \u2013 you are not booking a charge related to a potential refund, you are booking a \u2013 this is an assumed number up, an ROE percentage that you think will be the adjudicated number that comes out of the MISO case and what you will earn on until whatever future rate filing occurs 5 years or 10 years down the road.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. You've phrased it exactly correctly.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciating. Congrats on a good quarter.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Greetings, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Hi. How're you doing?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're great. How're you doing?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm managing.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Wait a minute. I thought you \u2013 last time you told me you were wonderful and award winning.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I got that, but then I will strive, how about that?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We appreciate that, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Yeah. I want to follow up on Steve's question on this gas main thing, because just to make sure I understand this. Is the gas \u2013 this accelerated main replacement issue, is that now out of this merger case and in the separate dockets that they opened up because of whistleblowers? So, we are not going to hear about this anymore? Because I'm just trying to \u2013 it seems that the AG's always coming out going back to this thing saying this is some \u2013 she is very upset about it and what have you. So I'm just trying to \u2013 is it out of the case?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think, well, let me answer it two ways. I think you probably will continue to hear about it, but in terms of technically, the whistleblower letters and the review of the program \u2013 well, let me put it this way. The whistleblower letters and our review of those whistleblower letters and any other investigations that are going on are now part of a separate docket.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Separate and apart from the merger case. But that doesn't mean that someone couldn't inject a discussion about it in our merger case. But it might be helpful, Paul, to clarify for you where we stand in the merger case itself.", "In essence, all the hearings have been completed, all the testimony is in, all the briefs are done and we would expect some time in the next few \u2013 certainly in the next couple of weeks, we would expect to see a draft order by the administrative law judge who is hearing the case. So once that draft order is out, then all the parties will have a comment \u2013 will have an opportunity to comment on the draft order, after that then the draft order will go to the commissioners themselves for a final decision. So in terms of evidence, in terms of positions in the case, all of that is basically in the record and the record is now essentially closed other than comments on a draft order, if that's helpful to you.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "That's very helpful. And then so I mean, does the settlement makes sense at this point given how far along everything is?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "At this point, well, this being this close to a draft order, my own view would be the most sensible thing to do is to let the process play out and the process is getting close to the deadline.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And if you think about sitting here on today we're at May 5, we would be less than 60 \u2013 well, about 60 days away from the statutory deadline for a decision.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And now you've actually seen the Liberty Consulting report which I'm afraid I have not, I guess it's been publicly released now. Is that right? Or it's just you guys who get it. I don't know, because I...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not sure that it's been publicly released, but the commission asked or gave us specific authority and all the parties were fine with us reviewing the material in the interim Liberty report and in the draft \u2013 as Allen said, draft final report. So yes, we have seen the review. We have seen the audit.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So you guys are in a great position to answer some of these \u2013 well, I am not going to ask you to go over all of it. But I mean it just this idea that the budget has ballooned according to some of the filings that they are attributing to this program and that it is \u2013 that they are behind schedule and way over budget, I guess, is basically sort of what we are hearing. When you look at it, and knowing what you know about obviously gas utility work and what have you, you guys feel comfortable that this is a program that can be managed and completed in a commercially effective way, is that a good way to put it or do you follow me?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me answer it this way. There are a lot of moving pieces in terms of what the eventual cost might be. But do we believe based on what we've seen that, A, the work is needed; and B, it can be done professionally and in a long-term cost effective way? Yes. But at this point, I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on what the exact right budget number should be.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "But as we look at the recommendations from the Liberty audit, I mean the recommendations frankly make a great deal of sense. There is nothing in the Liberty audit that I have seen that is troublesome from the standpoint of can we effectively manage the program. I'm confident we can.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Excellent. Thanks so much.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're more than welcome.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right, ladies and gentlemen, well, I think that concludes our conference call for today. We really appreciate you participating.

Henderson", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting and welcome to Wisconsin Energy\u2019s Conference Call to review 2012 Third Quarter Results. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on Management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the Company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review the Company\u2019s 2012 third quarter results. And for all of you dialing in from the East coast, we hope that you and your family are safe and coping well with the aftermath of hurricane Sandy.", "Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of WE Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Assistant Treasurer.", "Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.67 a share for the third quarter of 2012. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $0.55 a share for the third quarter of 2011. The weather of course has been a major story throughout this year. We began 2012 with a warmest winter in the 122 years. That was followed by an old fashion heat way of the summer. The hottest day in Milwaukee this year was on July 5, when the temperature reached 103 degrees.", "I\u2019m pleased to report to you that our generating fleet performed very well. We were able to meet the strong customer demand for energy, thanks to the $3 billion we\u2019ve invested over the past decade in new efficient generating units through our Power the Future plan.", "Turning now to the economy, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate at 7.3% as of September remains well below the national average. However, energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers excluding the iron ore mines drop by 1.8% in the third quarter of this year. This was slightly better though, than our expectations. Our plan for the year as you may remember projected a reduction in sales to our large commercial and industrial group in part because two customers began using their own soft generation. Excluding these two customers and the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial sales actually rose by six-tenths of 1%. Sectors showing particular strength in the quarter included food products, chemical manufacturing and metal fabrication.", "We\u2019re also seeing an uptick now in new customer connections. New electric service installations are up 9.8% compared to the first nine months of last year. And connections of new natural gas customers, given today\u2019s price of natural gas, are up by more than 14% compared with the same period a year-ago.", "On the construction front, we have one major project underway. The 50 megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin and one significant project that was recently completed, the air quality control upgrade at our original Oak Creek units. In fact on September 4, we closed out this $900 million air quality project, the second largest construction project in our history on time and better than budget.", "The wet scrubbers and the selective catalytic reduction equipment are operational now and delivering the emission reductions that we had expected. We\u2019re completing punch list items and final tuning and testing, as well as demolition of the old chimneys at the site. Demolition of the chimneys and a few remaining project items are expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year.", "We are also making excellent progress on our biomass fuel generating plant at the site of the Domtar Paper Mill in Rothschild. Construction is approximately 50% complete now. We are on schedule and on budget to meet a completion date by the end of 2013. The main boiler erection will continue into the first quarter of next year at the site, a steam turbine and generator have been delivered and placed on their foundations, piping and electrical work have begun in several areas of the complex including the main boiler, turbine, water treatment, cooling water, pump house and auxiliary boilers. The transformers, switches, and bus-bar have also been set in the switch yard and construction of the piping for the mills steam supply is now underway.", "As I\u2019ve noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. We will be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the operating paper mill will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Of course the biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park that we completed last year are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin\u2019s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, that standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity delivered from renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using an historical baseline. Applying that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.", "When we complete the biomass project we will be well positioned to meet that 2015 standard. Also we recently signed agreements for renewable energy credits, which should allow us to be in compliance through the year 2019 and because of favorable market conditions we plan to purchase more renewable credits further extending the timeframe that we expect to be in compliance.", "Turning now to other items of interest. In past quarters, we discussed with you the impact we were seeing from conditions in the coal and natural gas markets. Natural gas prices have continued to be at relatively low levels influencing the dispatch order and locational marginal pricing in the Midwest power market. Over the years, of course, the key to serving customers at a competitive price has been fuel diversity and fuel diversity was a core principle of our Power the Future plan.", "You may remember that our plan called for the addition of 2200 megawatts of new capacity. Capacity that is almost equally balanced between natural gas and coal. And now with our efficient new capacity in place and natural gas prices at low levels, our natural gas burn is expected to nearly double from 28.5 billion cubic feet last year to 50 billion cubic feet this year. In fact our natural gas units at Port Washington operated at a 56% capacity factor in the first three quarters of this year. This compares with a 23% capacity factor during the same period of 2011. Our Port Washington units are essentially now being dispatched as base load units.", "And of course as our natural gas burns have gone up, our coal burns have naturally come down. We are projecting to burn approximately 8.1 million tons of coal this year versus 10.7 million tons in 2011. We will achieve this reduction by maximizing the use of coal storage facilities and by working with our coal suppliers to amend existing contracts.", "Another important development; we are waiting approval of our filing for a revised air permit that would allow us to blend Western and Eastern coals at our new Oak Creek expansion units. The new units are currently permitted to burn Eastern bituminous coal. However, moving to a blend with Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal could substantially lower fuel cost for our customers.", "We expect to receive approval of our request for a revised air permit by year-end. Our plan then calls for us to begin testing the blended coal at our Oak Creek expansion units during the year 2013. Overall, our diverse fleet and our long-term power purchase agreement for nuclear energy position us well as the power markets continue to evolve.", "Now I will briefly review where we stand on the regulatory front in Wisconsin, where we\u2019re in the final stages of our only active rate case. As you may recall, base rates for our electric customers in Wisconsin are frozen for 2012. We proposed and the Wisconsin Commission accepted a creative approach to delay a base rate increase as the economy here continues to recover. Looking forward to 2013 and 2014, we filed a rate request with the Wisconsin Commission seeking an increase for our electric and steam customers and a decrease for our natural gas customers for 2013.", "On the electric side of our business, the base rate adjustments were seeking in the next two years are driven by approximately $1.6 billion of capital investment. These are investments in strengthening reliability, in meeting environmental requirements and complying with Wisconsin\u2019s renewable energy mandate and their investments that the Commission previously approved. The projects previously approved by the Commission include the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units, the Glacier Hills Wind Park, the biomass facility and the expansion units at Oak Creek.", "Our proposal includes using a federal energy grant that we expect to receive for our biomass facility. After applying this cash grant the result would be a net customer bill increase of 3.6% in 2013 and 2014. Fuel cost estimates for 2013 will continue to be refined based on updated information of course. A final fuel cost recovery rate will also be part of the Commission\u2019s order that we expect to receive in December.", "On the natural gas front, we proposed as I mentioned a decrease in base rates for 2013. We're seeking a 2.3% decrease for Wisconsin Gas customers and a two-tenths of 1% decrease for Wisconsin Electric gas customers. Then for 2014 we\u2019re proposing the base rates for all of our natural gas customers remain flat.", "For our steam utility, we filed for an increase in 2013 of approximately 6% for our downtown Milwaukee steam customers and 7% for our Milwaukee County steam customers. In 2014, our proposal calls for a 6% increase for downtown customers and for Milwaukee County customers as well. You may remember that the Wisconsin commission does not intend to pursue capital structure or return on equity as issues in this proceeding. We expect to receive the orders by the end of 2012. We\u2019ve asked that new electric and steam rates go into effect at the start of 2013 and 2014 and that new gas rates be effective at the start of 2013 as well.", "Switching gears now, you will recall that our Board has approved a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013 that authorizes us to buy back $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During the third quarter of this year we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at a cost of $14 million. As of September 30, this brings the total number of shares repurchased under the plan to approximately 3.6 million at a cost of $114 million. That equates to an average purchase price of just $31.45 a share.", "And as we previously announced, our Board has adopted a dividend policy that targets a 60% payout ratio in 2014. This policy should support double-digit growth in the dividend in both 2013 and 2014 as we move toward a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.", "Finally, I'd like to briefly touch on the investment opportunities that we see in our core business. As we\u2019ve mentioned our capital budget calls for spending up to $3.5 billion over the five-year period 2012 through 2016. And with this five-year budget the nature of our capital investments is shifting away from high-profile projects such as our Power the Future units, renewable generation and large air quality controls. Instead our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. The building blocks, if you will of our delivery business, pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations.", "The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory, construction are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the major mega projects we\u2019ve just completed. Our focus on renewing our distribution facilities is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest.", "Also, as you may recall, the future of the Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is under review because of expected changes in National Ambient Air Quality Standards. So, we\u2019ve been working to identify a life extension option for the Presque Isle plant that is economically beneficial for our customers.", "We are close now to signing a joint venture agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative for environmental upgrades at the Presque Isle units and potential joint ownership of the plant. Under this proposed agreement, Wolverine would pay for the environmental upgrades and receive an ownership interest in the facility. Preliminary work has continued on this project, we\u2019ve completed the second phase of engineering and a detailed scope of work has been developed. If the joint venture moves forward, we would not expect our rate base to be reduced. The transaction would of course be subject to customary regulatory approvals.", "In August, we also announced our plans to convert the fuel source for the Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley plant is a cogeneration facility, located along the Menomonee River in Milwaukee that generates electricity for the grid and produces steam to heat hundreds of downtown Milwaukee buildings. Our analysis shows that converting the fuel source for the plant will actually reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the Valley units.", "We plan to file an application with the Wisconsin Commission in the second quarter of 2013 for approval to modify the plant to use only natural gas in the future. The electric capacity of the plant is expected to remain at 280 megawatts. If approved, we will target completion of the conversion for late 2015 or early 2016. The current cost estimate is between $60 million and $65 million. And as you may remember, in addition we will upgrade the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. The Wisconsin Commission approved this $26 million investment back in June. We already believe that the plan we put in place will secure Valley\u2019s role in meeting the energy needs of a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many, many years to come.", "Finally there is one more development that I\u2019d like to cover with you today. Our latest analysis shows that additional capacity is needed for our natural gas distribution network in the Western part of Wisconsin. We are beginning to evaluate routes to serve the communities between Eau Claire County in the far Western part of the state and the City of Tomah in Monroe County in West Central Wisconsin.", "This region will need additional capacity for three reasons; to address reliability, to meet growth and demand from customers who are converting from propane, and also from the extensive growth we are seeing in sand mining in that part of the state. The fine sand that\u2019s used in hydraulic fracking is found in abundance in Western Wisconsin and mining and processing operations are thriving now in this region.", "We plan to seek approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in 2013 to proceed with the necessary system enhancements. Our expected investment in this initial phase of this gas distribution project is approximately $150 million.", "And now with more details on our third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2012 is our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?", "J. Patrick Keyes", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier our 2012 third quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.67 a share, as compared to $0.55 a share in 2011. The results were better than last year because of lower operation and maintenance costs, favorable fuel recoveries and the positive impact of the Company share repurchase program.", "Taking a closer look at the numbers, I will focus on the earnings drivers at the operating income level by business segment and then touch on the other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows for the first nine months of the year.", "Our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2012 was $281 million as compared to $224 million in last year\u2019s third quarter, an increase of $57 million. Starting with the utility energy segment you will see that the operating income totaled $191 million, an increase of $55 million versus 2011.", "As Gale mentioned earlier, we experienced record heat in the third quarter of 2012. Well, we also experienced a hot third quarter in 2011. So the weather was positive compared to normal, but was not the major factor in our relatively strong third quarter performance. I will elaborate further on the impact of weather in my sales remarks.", "When looking at our utility operating income in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011, we see positive variances because of lower O&M, and more favorable fuel recoveries. Our non-fuel O&M was $53 million lower this quarter primarily because of the one-year rate amortization holiday that began in January. Our fuel recoveries improved by $19 million because of lower natural gas prices.", "Partially offsetting these items was increased utility depreciation expense of $11 million driven by the new Glacier Hills Wind Park which went into service in December of last year and the new air quality control project at our older Oak Creek units, the last train of which went into service in early September. Combined these two projects represent almost $1.3 billion of new investment.", "The rate agreement in place for 2012 contemplated these investments. As you will recall, we agreed to freeze base electric rates and in return the Wisconsin Commission approved a one-year holiday on the amortization of certain regulatory assets. The reduction in O&M expenses as a result of the amortization holiday allows us to offset higher depreciation cost in new assets and earn a return on the $1.3 billion of new investment.", "Operating income in the Non-Utility Energy Segment, which consists primarily of our Power the Future units, was up by $2 million. As we mentioned during previous calls, we finalized the depreciable lives of the new Oak Creek units in 2012, which had a slight positive impact on earnings. Taking the changes for these two segments together, you arrive at the $57 million increase in operating income for the third quarter of 2012.", "Corporate charges and other miscellaneous items were flat year-over-year. During the third quarter of 2012, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased just slightly over 2011. Our other income was reduced by $7 million because of lower AFUDC. In the third quarter last year, we were earning AFUDC on the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the Air Quality Control project at our Oak Creek site. We have stopped accruing AFUDC, now that these assets have been placed in service.", "Net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily because of lower capitalized interest associated with less construction work. Consolidated income tax expense rose by approximately $21 million because of higher pre-tax earnings and higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36.5%. Combining all of these items, brings you to $156 million of net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2012 or earnings of $0.67 per share.", "During the first nine months of 2012, our adjusted operating cash flow totaled $1 billion, which is a $238 million increase over the same period in 2011. Our adjusted operating cash flow includes the impact of changes in restricted cash. The largest favorable factor relates to our benefits plants. In September of this year, we contributed $100 million to our plants compared to $257 million last year.", "Our total capital expenditures decreased by $135 million in the first nine months of 2012 as compared to the corresponding period in 2011. We saw lower capital expenditures as large capital projects were completed. We also paid $207 million in common dividends in the first nine months of 2012, which was $25 million greater than the same period last year. Dividends in the first nine months equate to an annual rate of $1.20 per share, which is a 15% increase over the prior-year\u2019s annual dividend of $1.04 per share.", "As of September 30, 2012, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.1%. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "As shown in the earnings packet on our website, retail sales of electricity decreased by seven-tenths of 1% during the first nine months of 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011. Our weather normalized sales were down by 1.7%. In our plan for the year we took into account an extended outage at our largest customer, and we knew that two other customers were move to self generation. Adjusting for these three customers normalized retail sales were flat during the first nine months of 2012 as compared to 2011.", "Looking now at individual customer segments. We see actual residential sales slightly down in the quarter compared to 2011. Although the quarter overall was warmer than 2011, the weather pattern was different in 2012. This year\u2019s third quarter started out with a week of intense heat followed by a cooler period. And then the end of the quarter was slightly warmer than 2011. Conversely, high humidity and warmer than normal temperatures persisted throughout the third quarter in 2011.", "On a year-to-date basis, residential sales are up six-tenths of 1% and on a normalized basis residential sales are down seven-tenths of 1%. Across our small commercial and industrial group we saw actual quarterly sales up seven-tenths of 1% and year-to-date sales up 1.1%.On a weather normalized basis, year-to-date sales to small commercial and industrial customers are up six-tenths of 1%. We continue to see modest growth in our small C&I class.", "In the large commercial industrial segment, quarterly sales were down by 8.3%. However if you exclude the iron ore mines and the two self generation customers, sales were up six-tenths of 1%. Year-to-date sales are down 3.3% and excluding those same customers sales are up by 1.7%. On a normalized basis, year-to-date sales excluding these customers are flat.", "Turning now to our earnings guidance. We are increasing our guidance for the year. We now expect our earnings for 2012 to be in the range of $2.31 a share to $2.33 a share. Assuming normal weather our guidance for the fourth quarter is in a range of $0.39 to $0.41 a share.", "We will be carrying out a number of maintenance projects in the fourth quarter. In addition, the AFUDC will be lower and depreciation expense will be higher both compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter because of the $1.3 billion of assets we placed in service. However, we still expect to earn our full allowed return on equity at Wisconsin Electric.", "And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi, Greg. ", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "Thanks, guys.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Greg, your bunker would (indiscernible) these days?", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "I\u2019d rather sleep in a puddle, but there is no power south of 48th street, but I was able to find a bunk at some place with power until they can get that transformer back on 13th street. They \u2013 apparently they had a 14 foot storm surge when the highest storm surge they had seen was 12.5 feet in 1888, so bad luck for ConEd, but hopefully they will get power back on soon. Anyways \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "(Indiscernible) hanging in there, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "My first question is on the coal blending, I visited the site of the construction site several times while you were building the new units, and I know that you\u2019ve a sort of a state-of-the-art coal blending facility there. What was the initial expected use of the coal blending facility, if not to blend coals they way you\u2019re now asking to blend them or was it initially meant mainly to blend sort of (indiscernible) and other Eastern coals, and now you are asking to blend Eastern and Western. Can you explain that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We will let Allen Leverett to answer that for you, Greg.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yeah and I\u2019m not sure, Greg, what time period you were at the site. We don\u2019t actually have a blending facility. What you might be remembering is inside that very large cold storage building there is \u2013 what\u2019s called a stacker reclaimer, but we don\u2019t actually have the capability right now to be able to blend at the site \u2026", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "Okay. That was what I was thinking of. So, [thank you].", "Allen L. Leverett", "\u2026 either on the belt or inside the boiler itself. So what we are looking to do is really explore next year, two approaches to doing fuel blending. So one, the so-called on the belt where you actually have a blending facility like you are probably thinking of at other sites and then another approach where you would actually blend what they call in the furnace. So we are going to look at those two approaches and then figure out what\u2019s really the best long-term approach to really getting some fuel flexibility at the site.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "How much Powder River Basin coal would you be buying if you were given approval to do what you\u2019re asking for?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, I guess, I would think of it in terms of potential blend percentages. And our long-term goal Greg is to be able to burn either 100% bituminous or 100% PRB. So we want to be able to burn all blends in between, but I think realistically probably the highest we\u2019re going to get on PRB for a while would be 80% PRB. But we will have to do a lot of testing in order to figure out what\u2019s the best approach and what are the hurdles that we will have to overcome to get to that 80% level. So I think for the next few years, I think that's probably from a practical standpoint the cap on what we could burn in terms of PRB, but longer-term we would like the flexibility to go to 100%.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And Greg this is Gale. Just one other point that might be helpful, we did invest early on and you maybe remembering this as well, early on in the design of these new units we did invest about $24 million to make sure that with an additional investment that Allen\u2019s talking about, we could actually have the unit do operate on a blend of coals. So the initial design and the initial work there built in the capability we need, so that if we made an additional investment in blending it could actually pay off.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "Great. Next question is on capital spending, when we look at the capital spending program in your last analyst update, should we be adding the programs you talked about in terms of the \u2013 I think it was to the gas pipeline expansions and the powering of the generation unit? Are those additional capital spending on top of what you\u2019ve already budgeted or those fall inside \u2013 that you\u2019ve already sort of budgeted for?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good question, Greg and those in terms of that 2012 through 2016 $3.5 billion program these fall inside.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "They fall inside, great. Final question, you had talked about the possibility that the Government of Wisconsin might consider selling some of its power generation units that it just simply doesn\u2019t have the money to maintain or retrofit with environmental upgrades. Is there been any progress on that front and do you think that that will be an event that you will be able to consider making an investment in 2013?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Again, good question, Greg. If this occurs, meaning if legislation \u2013 this takes a piece of legislation to enable the current administration to sell those units. There are 37, some of them very small, but 37 generating units some of them provide steam only across the State of Wisconsin. I certainly \u2013 from everything we can tell the governor would still like to put the operation of those plants and the environmental upgrades that will cost several hundred million dollars into the private sector. And if that occurs, it would occur I think in 2013 with a piece of legislation. So that will be a 2013 event if it does occur. But certainly the logic of why that would be a good thing for the state is firmly in place.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "Thanks, guys.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Von Riesemann with UBS.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi, Jim.", "Jim Von Riesemann - UBS Securities", "Hi, Gale. How are you?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We are good. Are you hanging out, okay?", "Jim Von Riesemann - UBS Securities", "We are doing fine. Thanks for asking though. Hang out, I\u2019m in car driving where I\u2019ve actual power to talk to you. So I\u2019m safe. The question is really a broad picture. With Dominion\u2019s announced shutdown of the Kewaunee facility, can you talk broadly about energy policy in the state of Wisconsin, what it means from both generation needs and maybe transmission needs, especially in light of the fracking sands too?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure. We would be happy too. I think that there is one important conclusion that comes out of the \u2013 it comes out naturally out of the decision by Dominion to close the Kewaunee reactor and that is \u2013 there is no doubt in my mind, it makes more valuable to our customers, the Port Washington natural gas units and the Oak Creek coal units that we've completed as part of Power the Future. And if you think about it, it\u2019s taking over 500 megawatts of base load capacity out of the picture in the State of Wisconsin. So, regardless of growth or regardless of anything else that happens because we have these brand new very efficient units in place, it is bound to make those units more valuable for our customers. I think that's piece one.", "Piece two, you asked about transmission. And I do know that American Transmission Company is taking another hard look at one particular transmission line that it had proposed. It actually had proposed the transmission line to help move energy out of the Point Beach plant that's been operated. If you remember NextEra I think added about 17% to the capacity of the Point Beach units.", "And American Transmission Company had proposed to help alleviate some transmission constraints in that area by building a new transmission line. They\u2019ve now withdrawn that proposal. They still think something will be needed. But remember Kewaunee and the Point Beach units are very near to each other. So taking Kewaunee out of service probably alleviates some of the transmission constraints. So there maybe some less, modestly less investment in one particular transmission line by ATC as a result of this. However, we really don\u2019t see any major impact on our ATC earnings growth in the near-term as a result of this. I mean we think the prospects for ATC earnings growth certainly over the next three to five years remain as we have them in our plan. Does that help, Jim?", "Jim Von Riesemann - UBS Securities", "That does. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome. Hang in there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC Financial.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi, Kit.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Are you in Jersey or where are you Kit?", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "I\u2019m in Midtown. So the lights are on, but the steam is not. So no hot water. Oh well, there are worse problems.", "Gale E. Klappa", "If you come to Downtown Milwaukee, we'll get you a shower.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "Yeah, that sounded very attractive, we have this big crane hanging over here. You may have \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "Oh my goodness, yeah.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "\u2026 seen the pictures, right?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "That\u2019s an engineering project, you should send some guys to work on.", "Gale E. Klappa", "But we got a bunch of crews out there helping up, but not on the crane.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "There you go. Follow-up on your discussion on the buyback, so this is the first in a while I believe can you discuss with us what let\u2019s say trip wire there was that led to the decision to go ahead and buyback and what we should look for then on the remaining amount of authorization over the next five quarters, now?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure, be happy to and really the trip wire was very simple and it consisted of two factors that Pat and I took into account. And the first was that we continue to do very well on cash generation this year. And as you know we don\u2019t think building up and just holding cash on our balance sheet makes a whole lot of sense. So we were continuing to do well against our plan on cash generation for a number of reasons. And then secondly, as you know the market choked a little bit over the last few months particularly after utilities hit a high in early August and we thought as the stock price retreated some we thought it was a good opportunity to spend a very modest amount of money it was only $14 million.", "And so those were the factors that led to our decision to go ahead and repurchase $14 million. As I mentioned we are now at about $114 million total of our share repurchases since the start of 2011. And we\u2019ve been able to do that at $31.45 a share for the average repurchase price, which we think is very, very good price. I don\u2019t think you can read anything into what that might mean for the next few quarters. We can be very patient here, but again I think fundamentally a build-up of cash on the balance sheet it\u2019s better even where the stock is trading to buyback stock than to build up a lot of cash on the balance sheet. But we also are balancing all of that against investment opportunities as we see them. So our preference obviously would be to invest the capital and our cash flow in additional utility like projects that do not change our risk profile. One of which of course, would be the one we just talked about if it came to pass, which would be the state-owned power plants.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "Very good. And speaking of the investment opportunities then, can you give us a few more details on the gas pipeline expansion opportunity, even looking a little longer term out in Western Wisconsin?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the first phase of this project we thought, if approved would be approximately $150 million. There is as we look at potential demand and as we look at reliability issues in the western part of the state, there could be beyond this first phase a second phase that might be $50 million, $60 million of additional capital as well, but that would be a little further out into the five year period.", "Let me just say this about the western gas expansion project that we\u2019re going to prepare an application for to the commission. The western part of Wisconsin is quite rural, and our distribution network out there in the western part of the state has not been incredibly robust. But we\u2019re seeing other things going on in addition to the explosion of frac sand mining there. It means the frac sand is not the only reason why we think this is an investment we need to make for reliability. We have two hubs out in the western part of the state where our reserve margins even with very modest growth will go below acceptable levels over the next couple of years.", "So, just looking at system reliability on our gas distribution network we believe we need to make this investment and then we\u2019re also seeing and you can see it in the numbers I mentioned earlier. We\u2019re also seeing a pretty significant uptick in customers moving to natural gas particularly from propane in rural areas. I think I mentioned to you, our new customer connections over our entire system for the first nine months of this year on the natural gas side are up 14% compared to a year ago. So we\u2019re seeing customer growth, we\u2019re seeing just general demand requiring us to make some enhancements and then we\u2019re seeing a very, very strong expansion of frac sand mining in the western part of the state. I believe for example just talking with our folks yesterday that we\u2019re in conversations with 12 or more frac sand mining operations in the western part of the state who asked us to take a hard look at providing them service.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Financial", "All right, good. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Terrific. Thanks, Kit. I appreciate it. Hang in there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Kind of an O&M related question. Just want to make sure I\u2019m following the numbers correctly here. Year-to-date, how much was the drop off tied to the regulatory amortization and then what explains the rest of the year-over-year decline in O&M?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay, well essentially on the rate order that we have in place freezing base rates, it has as part of that order $37 million per quarter in essence of cessation of amortization of regulatory assets. So if you look at this quarter for example, of the O&M reduction $37 million was tied to the rate order and the cessation of amortization of regulatory assets, the remainder is what I would say \u2013 and I am really proud of our managers across the business, the remainder is dozens of very solid O&M cost control initiatives that have really been bearing fruit.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And how do we think about what the year-to-date define in O&M is outside of the amortization and how do we compare that to the O&M requested in your general rate cases?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay, well we have got some numbers here, we\u2019re turning to the right page. First of all if you take the amount associated with the holiday, the amortization holiday and the rate freeze, Steve its $37 million times three, right?", "Stephen P. Dickson", "That\u2019s right. So $101 million for the year and at the utility the O&M reduction is about $107 million. So you\u2019ve got $4 million of increase cost and that\u2019s across the Boards benefit cost, medical costs or higher. So basically at the utility the story is the freeze on the amortization.", "Gale E. Klappa", "All right. Now to your question Michael about, how does that compare with our O&M request in the rate case?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Yeah.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Really kind of apples-to-oranges, because a big part \u2013 well the biggest part of our rate case is, the recovery off and on at $1.3 billion of capital investment on projects the commission has already approved. So we do our adding to our rate request because we need people to operate for example, the quality controls at the overall creek units that are now in service. So in essence what I think you could \u2013 the conclusion you could properly draw is that for basic ongoing O&M we tried to stay pretty flat from 13 to 12, but there is a component of O&M that we need to add because we\u2019re adding people to operate the new assets coming into service.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Understood. One final question; there\u2019s been some news flow about an ATC proposed line and I believe one of your neighbors, there had been some conflicts that had gone in to the FERC regarding which utility, whether it was ATC or whether it was I think one of the Xcel subsidiaries would actually be the builder of the line and I saw in the last 24 or 48 hours some news about potentially what's drawing application. Can you just provide some color on this please?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I will ask Allen Leverett to answer that, but to frame it for you, I don\u2019t think the dispute is about who\u2019s going to build the line, it\u2019s who will eventually own what chunk of the line.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Who will be sharing of the capacity in ownership but mostly it\u2019s an issue about ownership. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yeah, well I think maybe Michael, you were alluding to two separate facilities. The first one is the one where ATC is having dispute with Xcel and that\u2019s the Badger Coulee line and that\u2019s about $350 million facility. It could very well be that ATC and Xcel end up sharing 50-50 the ownership of that facility. But all that\u2019s on appeal at the FERC at this point.", "I would say longer term Michael, as you have order 1000 kick in, the FERC order around planning I think in the future we shouldn\u2019t have uncertainty about ownership in these types of situations, but the Badger Coulee facility is certainly an open issue. The other facility that you may have been thinking about is the one that\u2019s connected with the Kewaunee closure.", "Originally ATC had proposed to build a facility called Barnhart-Branch River, and they\u2019re putting that on hold given that Kewaunee is going to be closing. So that\u2019s the second facility I think that you\u2019re referring to. But from a high level, I\u2019d just reiterate what Gale was saying earlier.", "We wouldn\u2019t see, regardless of what happens with the ownership of Badger Coulee, regardless of what happens with Barnhart-Branch River, we don\u2019t see an impact in ATC earnings over the next three years meaning \u201813 to \u201915. Does that help, Michael?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Very helpful, Allen. Very helpful, Gale. Thanks guys. I much appreciate it.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome. Take care.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good afternoon, Paul. How you doing?", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Well. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good. Now you\u2019re not anywhere near New York?", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "There\u2019s one benefit to living in Cleveland, I guess?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Besides nothing (indiscernible).", "Gale E. Klappa", "What is that \u2013 is that you\u2019re not part of that show on TV called Broken Cleveland; are you?", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "I\u2019m [damn] near.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Almost broken.", "Gale E. Klappa", "What can we do for you, Paul?", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "What was the absolute fuel recovery through the quarter?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I think it was $19 million.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "For last year it was break even?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That\u2019s correct.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "And what's the risk of additional \u2026", "Allen L. Leverett", "Paul, we \u2013 sorry Paul we misunderstood that. The benefit to the quarter on a year-to-year basis was $19 million. In the third quarter we had higher costs because the plants are running and so last year we under recovered by $34 million and this year it\u2019s about $15 million. So the change was about $19 million.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Got it.", "Gale E. Klappa", "We were under recovered for the quarter, but the positive swing was $19 million.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Right.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Not as under recovered, okay. And what's the potential for more self-generation?", "Gale E. Klappa", "The two particular customers that we mentioned that have moved to self-generation where in my opinion fairly unique circumstances. One is a paper mill and they are moving more to use of biomass to fuel their paper operations, and the other is a sewage district where they\u2019ve got the ability to use some methane gas on and off. Those circumstances again I think are pretty unique to those two particular customers. I would not view this as a trend.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Where did you outperform relative to third quarter guidance?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well relative to third quarter guidance I think there are couple of places where we did better than we thought when we gave our third quarter guidance. And the first is, when we were on the call at the end of the second quarter we knew we'd have some warm weather, but overall we came in better than we thought just on revenues, because of the intense heat in early July and then it got warmer again towards the end of the quarter. So particularly the warmth we saw at the end of the quarter. We had a sense because when we were on the call we knew about the early July, but the warmth at the end of the quarter was quite helpful in terms of additional sales and then I believe we actually did a little bit on fuel recovery than we thought we were going to do.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Okay. And Gale, is it true for Halloween you\u2019re going to be a CEO of a large Charlotte based utility?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t deliver the Jim Rogers masks. So I don\u2019t know.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah, I appreciate that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with J.P. Morgan.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good. Leslie, how are you today?", "Operator", "Leslie, your line is open.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Leslie went trick-or-treating I think.", "Operator", "And we\u2019ve moved on to the next question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Hey Pat, I just want to make sure I understood some of your comments about the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes from fourth quarter '11 to fourth quarter '12, just trying to think about the bridge year-over-year?", "J. Patrick Keyes", "Sure, Michael. I'll just kind of re-summarize some of my remarks. I think the biggest difference is we talked about $0.39 to $0.41 as our guidance in the fourth quarter this year. One thing is -- as Gale mentioned, we had a very hot summer. We've got a lot of stress on the network, so we've got a number of maintenance projects that we've added to our fourth quarter plans, which is additional spend than we had originally.", "And we also talked about the rate settlement, and that $37 million flat a quarter was kind of a simplified way to do it. If you think about how the depreciation expense for an example falls, it picks-up in the fourth quarter because everything is on line. So, we've got additional depreciation vis-\u00e0-vis that amortization order. That's probably the two biggest.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah, I think Pat\u2019s kind of nailed it. But as we said during the prepared remarks, we fully expect to earn our allowed authorized return on equity at Wisconsin Electric.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay. I just want to make sure on the depreciation side. If the regulatory amort is rolling off and that the primary impact of that is actually felt in O&M. What's driving \u2013 were you brining South Oak Creek [enviro] controls into service and therefore you experienced that depreciation for the first time beginning in fourth quarter 2012, or is there some other driver?", "J. Patrick Keyes", "That's direct on a 78 train, yes.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah. We completed the last segment of the air quality control upgrade at the older Oak Creek units on September 4. So when that happens obviously we stop accruing allowance for funds used during construction. We start depreciating the new asset. So, all of those two things the cessation of AFUDC, and the depreciation of the asset are basically \u2013 almost $900 million project, that's a pretty big swing for Q4.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it, okay. Thanks guys. I much appreciate it.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome Michael.", "Operator", "And we do have a question from the line of Leslie Rich with J.P. Morgan.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi, Leslie.", "Operator", "Leslie, your line is open.", "Gale E. Klappa", "I\u2019ll tell you what we can do. We will be happy to call Leslie later after the call, since she obviously is having some difficultly with either her phone or with the power in New York.", "Operator", "Yes sir. And your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Greetings Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Good evening. Can you hear me?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We sure can.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Just two quick ones here; the 9.8% increase I think you said for electrical connects for the last nine months. Did I hear that correct and how does that related to customer growth?", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are correct, I think we said 9.8% uptick in for the nine month period this year compared with the first nine months of last year in Electric, new customer connections, but on the natural gas side it's actually above 14% growth. We are coming off though a very low period of growth in terms of new customers. So these are nice upticks, but we're still only seeing about a three to four tenths of 1% growth in the total customer base of both the electric -- actually probably four tenth of 1% growth on the natural gas side so far this year, little less than that on the electric slide, but encouraging -- encouraging.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "So when you say -- there are a lot of people who are -- lot of customers are disconnecting, is that what it is, so the net number isn't that much? Is that how we should think about it?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, I think what you're seeing is just very flattish growth. We haven't seen a lot of disconnects.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, so the 9.8%, why isn't that \u2013 I'm sorry to be so slow, why is that only leading to four tenths of 1% customer growth if you\u2019re getting 9.8% new customers and you\u2019re not losing that many?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Because if you look at and let's assume for a minute, all right, let's a take a one million for ease of discussion. We have about one million natural gas customers. So if you have four tenth of 1% growth in one year or three tenth of 1% growth in one year, and then four or five tenths of 1% growth in the next comparable period, you\u2019re not going to drive the raw numbers that much higher. It's the percentage growth compared to \u2026", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay I figured out. So in other words, it's the question of how much new customer -- I think I'm just -- I misunderstood for what base that was, okay. The iron ore mine, what was the actual impact of the iron ore mine? It sounds like you guys had really hot weather, but you had no new peak. If you had the iron ore mine operating, would you have had a new peak? Can you just tell us what the iron ore mine itself would have done?", "Gale E. Klappa", "And Will, I\u2019m looking at Scott and Steve on specifically on the iron ore mine, because they were at half load during those really hot days, and they\u2019re about -- probably it would have added another 100 megawatts.", "Stephen P. Dickson", "Yeah, 50 to 100.", "Gale E. Klappa", "50 to 100 additional megawatts. But there\u2019s one other point that's important here, and that is, this was July 5 and July 6. And as you know, during the first week of July a lot of manufacturing customers are shutdown for summer all of that week because it's a holiday week. So, not only did we have the mines because of their planned outage at half load if you will, but we had a lot of manufacturing customers that weren\u2019t operating. So, there is no doubt in my mind that had it been a normal week, assume for a minute those hot temperatures that occurred on July 5 and July 6, had occurred on July 15. No doubt in my mind we would have set a new peak.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Now, you guys did benefit from weather though, I mean you guys mentioned how it was dispersed differently, but if I am looking at your financials, you guys do actually seem to suggest if I'm reading them correctly that, the quarter did improve over last quarter by $2 million. Is that -- am I understanding that correctly or is that taking all the stuff into account or do you follow what I'm saying?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Steve, I think the $2 million is pretty accurate.", "Stephen P. Dickson", "Yeah, basically last year weather was favorable by about $21 million, this year it's favorable by about $23 million compared to normal, so that\u2019s how you got the $2 impact as compared to last year. But compared to normal it's about $23 million better compared to normal this year.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then when we look at slide 11, and you mentioned a couple of things; I just want to make sure I understand this. Excluding the iron mine I guess or just excluding old mining, your retail sales growth is down the last nine months six tenths of 1% and that includes leap year, is that right, the benefit that you got from leap year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah. It does include that, but it also includes the two customers that we talked about that moved to self-generation.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Right, but they\u2019re not going to probably move back from self-generation, right?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No. That is correct.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "And I guess what I'm also wondering is, we are hearing a lot of interest out there in terms of the promotion of combined heat and power. And I know you mentioned that you don't see this as a trend the self-generation effort, and I just wanted to sort of highlight that, you don't see any trends or people being interested in combined heat and power, is that based because wholesale electric prices are low or how should we think of that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Really I don't see us having a lot of -- we haven't had a lot of inquiries where there are not many, many discussions going on with customers about combined heat and power investments. Our industrial rates I believe are low enough, and then of course we have for new and expanding customers a real time pricing rate that is very attractive. I think when we you look at our combination of the tools we have to be able to offer and to expanding customers and new customers and be very competitive. I think we stack up very, very well. And if I can give you and then I hope this won't confuse you.", "Let me give you two other energy sales statistics that were helpful to me, because when we start talking about weather adjusted and all these ins and outs, sometimes I think we can get lost in that and actually when you have weather as extreme as we've experienced both in the summer of 2011 and the summer 2012, you kind of get at the -- you kind of get two standard deviations away from norm and our weather normalization techniques that are available to the industry aren't that good frankly at the tail-end of these standard deviations.", "So what I asked our folks to do is go back and tell me for the spring-summer period. So the six-month period ended September 30; April, May, June, July, August, and September; just give me actual results for residential sales for this period, this year and that second and third quarter period last year. And this helped me sort through the trend. Our residential sales that was warm both years -- in both quarters of both years. Our residential for the six months ended September 30 are up 2.9% actual. Our small commercial and industrial is up 2.7%, and that makes a lot more sense to me, it is warm both periods, different patterns in terms of the intensity of the weather, but I think that may shed some light on the fact that I don't see us in a huge declining trend here.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, I guess the reason why I'm asking about Gale, quite frankly is you\u2019re not the only guys who are seeing very weak growth or negative growth. And we are seeing it all around the country. So, I just was wondering, is there anything else that you\u2019re seeing perhaps because I mean we'll say it\u2019s remarkable. Over the last 18 months, it seems to be pretty wide spread, but also I mean, just looking at some -- some utilities have had negative weather adjusted electric sales growth for almost three years. Is there anything, customer usage or anything that you\u2019re seeing -- I'm saying outside of -- do you follow what I'm asking?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah. I follow and I appreciate that. I do think; well first of all many of the utilities that you\u2019re properly saying or seeing negative trends here in sales growth, many of those were in the faster growth regions of the country, where the boom and bust has been much more dramatic than it has been in the Midwest. We simply are just more stable and have been through this recession than many, many other regions. There's not a flash of growth here, but it is steady and it is stable and we\u2019re beginning to see some commercial activity that we've not seen in five or six years. Announcement of new shopping centers, announcement of a potential brand new skyscraper in downtown Milwaukee. The one trend I am seeing I think is, that we are beginning to see some commercial growth on the horizon that we've not seen over the last five or six years.", "On the residential side, the other thing we are seeing is a continuation of what I've mentioned in past calls. Where we have -- what we call in the industry a shoulder month. Take a May or an October where it's easy for a customer not to turn-on the heat or to turn-off the air conditioning. We're seeing more conservation in the shoulder months where it is easier to concern. I don't think there\u2019s any question about that. So, those would be the two trends that I would point out to you; shoulder month conservation to a stronger degree than we have seen in the past and I think here for this region, some commercial growth that's on the horizon that may give our commercial and industrial sales a bit of a lift.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Happy Halloween.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Happy Halloween. Good questions.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Greetings Jay. How are you sir?", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Very well, thanks Gale. How about you?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah fine. Your power on.", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "My power is on. Thank you. Very different than 2003 when you and I chatted.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah, exactly.", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "And anyway I wanted to revisit the O&M item. I think I\u2019m still just getting a little confused sort of what happened in the third quarter, so am I\u2019m specifically speaking about the slug excluding the $37 million regulatory asset amortization holiday. So that was down about $16 million, $53 million net of $37 million.", "Can you give me just a flavor of what that was because as I look at it, it almost looks like some O&M was shifted to the fourth quarter because the weather was fairly similar, in fact actually probably somewhat more conducive to regular maintenance this year than last year? So, I am sort of confused with, so stressed about this third quarter that's forcing a lot of maintenance in the fourth quarter that wouldn't have been similar to a year ago. So anyway, just trying to get my head around this.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well we\u2019ll ask Steve to take a shot and then I\u2019ll also give you my view on it.", "Stephen P. Dickson", "Yeah you\u2019re right. It\u2019s about $53 million decline and $37 million relates to the amortization. There's a lot of small things in there, one of the things is the gas distribution expenses were down because there was a mild winter. So as we didn't need to perform as much work. There was a slight benefit in miscellaneous benefits expense because of a share performance on one of the benefit plans. So, that was a benefit to the Company reduction in expense and again that's tied to the stock price compared to other companies, but that was relatively minor. But there\u2019s a lot of small things, but maintenance and the delivery. And yeah, the other thing that helped us on the Electric side, even though it was very hot in the third quarter, we did not experience major storms. And so the storm expense was low compared to last year.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah. And overall, as I mentioned in addition and Steve is very accurate on the things he cited. We just have a lot of cost consciousness and a lot of cost control going on across the organization. Its little things here and there; but they all add up.", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Right, no -- no absolutely. But maybe think about it differently; with the major maintenance that you're doing in the fourth quarter that's dragging fourth quarter earnings relative to a year ago, not have occurred last year at all in the second half?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, but we\u2019ll have more of it in Q4 of this year than in Q4 of last year.", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "So more than in the second half -- ", "Gale E. Klappa", "I\u2019m sorry.", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "So more than in the second half of last year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah.", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "I understand in the fourth quarter definitely. I'm trying to get at the second half of \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "The answer is yes, more in the second half this year than in the second half last year.", "James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Dan I was hoping to hear from you today. Now before we get into this, I want to make sure that you\u2019re prepared for Halloween tonight. You have your bail money in small denominations, small bills because I am not going to bail you out again Dan.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "I have big bills, so \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "There you go. Well just forget my cell-phone number okay.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And the first question I have is kind of related to the rate proceeding you said you expect the decision by December. I'm just wondering if you could update us a little bit on kind of what discussions or what kind of testimony or feedback or whatever you've gotten from the Commission staff?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure, and I\u2019d be happy to Dan. In essence let me back up because I want to frame the case a little bit, and I think that\u2019ll help understand the briefs that have been filed in the case by all the parties. The predominant driver of our rate filing, remember it's 3.6% base rate increase that we're seeking. The overwhelmingly predominant driver is the capital we spent about $1.3 billion on the Glacier Hills Wind Park, on the air quality controls that we've just completed at the older Oak Creek units. Those are projects that were approved by the Commission. We've brought them in on time and on budget. And in the case of the air quality control upgrade actually better than budget.", "So the rate case is in essence about seeking recovery in rates for those investments that were previously approved. So the lion share of the case is about capital, that's already been spent. A very small amount of the case is about our O&M projections on how much O&M we need to spend in 2013 and 2014, because if you recall in Wisconsin we have a two-year forward looking test year, so we project our expenses and our investment levels for 2013 and 2014 as part of the rate case. The staff is suggesting that we should spend less O&M than we have proposed for the 2013 and 2014 period. But it appears that they are comfortable with and we would expect they would have been comfortable with the capital investments and the fact that they were brought in previously approved on time and on budget.", "So, the final rounds of briefs and discussions among the parties and with the commissioners as they\u2019re briefed is really about what's the -- it\u2019s really about now down to what is the O&M that's the appropriate O&M for us for 2013 and 2014. And as I mentioned to you for all of the Wisconsin utilities this year the Commission has decided that the current allowed return on equity and the current capital structure will stay in place. Does that help, Dan?", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So what's the ROE that\u2019s \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "For our Wisconsin Electric operation it's 10.4% and for our Wisconsin gas Corporation it's 10.5%.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. So the 3.6% is that like a onetime or is that, is there like one in 2013 and one in 2014 for the electric rate \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "More for the \u2013 it varies across the different operations, but for electric it's 3.6% and 3.6%. So 3.6% in 2013 and 3.6% in 2014, then we're actually and it\u2019d be helpful to remember this, we're actually filing for a decrease in our gas operations for Wisconsin Electric and in Wisconsin Gas operations as well.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Was that just a one-time decrease on the gas side then or how is that work?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, we\u2019re actually asking for a decrease and then for that decrease to remain in place for 2014.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, so that\u2019s rather two phase or is that just a onetime and then it would stay the same for gas?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is exactly right Dan.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "And I had a question, you mentioned \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "Plus we need to heat that jail cell a little more for you.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Right, yeah. I appreciate that. One thing you mentioned that you would be interested in if the State were to sell-off some of their generating facilities, but then you would need some sort of legislation related to that. Given the current and make-up of the legislature do you see that as something that's likely to happen or is that just something, I know that maybe the governor has that on his agenda, but have you -- what kind of feedback are you getting from the legislature?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, clearly the appetite for moving that forward will somewhat depend upon the outcome of the election in early November. However my sense is that there are some democratic legislators depending upon the use of the proceeds from the sale that could be very supportive of the sale. So, I'm not sure this is really a hugely part as an issue going forward and some of the support for the concept of selling the State owned power plants may well lie in, what would the governor intend to do with these one-time proceeds?", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And just to go back a little bit on what you're seeing, particularly from the manufacturing side. First, I just want to clarify on the ones that are doing self-generation. When do you expect that you won't be seeing the year-over-year impact on that? When did those kind of go off system so that the \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I think we've seen the impact on -- I'm looking at Scott Lauber and he\u2019s agreeing. I believe we've seen about the impact that we expect to see and we'll see it in this year's numbers. Comparisons next year should not have any further impact from the two customers or if so modest, very modest.", "Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So starting first quarter or what \u2026", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah, starting first quarter.", "Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then just, one thing I don't know how closely you look at this, but I noticed today the Milwaukee Purchasing Managers Index was down quite a bit. And I was wondering how much, if you know that has much correlation to what you see from the people you provide service to as far as a way to kind of get a sense on what's going on in the large manufacturers?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I wouldn\u2019t necessary place a ton of weight on that in terms of its influence on our large manufacturing customer base. What we look at, and we do this every week. We see a report that shows what is happening with our large industrial customers every single week and we look at it from the standpoint of latest four weeks compared to the prior four weeks. Latest 13 weeks compared to the 13 weeks of a year ago, and then week-to-week. So we have a very good reporting system that keeps us very much in tune with what's happening with our largest industrial customers. And right now, I think the bottom-line of what we're seeing is flat overall.", "Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then the last thing I was just wondering, you mentioned that one of the big differences in the cash from operations had to do with the pension funding. I was wondering if you'd give us a little color on what you expect on the pension funding going forward.", "Gale E. Klappa", "We\u2019ll let Pat give you the answer on that one.", "J. Patrick Keyes", "Sure, Dan. Few thoughts on the pension funding. First of all, we had a contribution plan in 2013 and we just pulled it forward. So that's one of the explanations I guess. Second, we are anticipating that our discount rate at the end of the year is going to be lower than it is right now. So, in round numbers, we're just over 5% now and based on all the latest actuarial assumptions I've seen we'll probably end up under 4%, so that drove up the size of our liability and drove the contribution. And I guess the third point would be, we kind of choose the $100 million based on all of the best knowledge we've got now that projects us out to be 100% funded at the end of the year.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And Dan, to Pat\u2019s last point. I think you'll find we\u2019re one of the few large companies around that will be fully funded on their pension liabilities.", "Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are welcome Dan. Behave now.", "Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "I\u2019ll try.", "Gale E. Klappa", "All right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi, Andy. How are you?", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.", "Good. How are you?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Fine.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.", "Just real quick question, most of mine have been answered. But if you could kind of opine on your ability to manage O&M costs in 2013, '14 outside of those additional O&M related to your additional capital investments that have been put in place?", "Gale E. Klappa", "On our ability to manage our O&M costs?", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.", "Correct.", "Gale E. Klappa", "We've proven to be very effective, very strong, very capable at managing our O&M costs, and I don't think that will change in any way, shape or form", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.", "Okay, but I mean in 2013, '14 you would expect to be able to keep O&M relatively flat outside of those additional capital investments?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Meaning outside of the O&M we needed to have for the additional people to run those additional \u2013 the additional assets. The answer is yes.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi, Vedula. Long time no talk to.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital", "Hey nice to talk to you, Gale. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are welcome. How\u2019s it going?", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital", "I\u2019m doing okay. Basically to follow-up on Paul Patterson\u2019s line of questioning, I think almost certain was that, but when you get to the next rate cycle can you kind of discuss a little bit on how much right now of your returning rates are kind of on the fixed tariff as opposed to volumetric at this point and do you want to kind of transition over maybe a little higher percentage to get away from volumetric risk or do you think if you can kind of tell us kind of where you\u2019re at there and whether it's kind of a good mix right now in terms of balancing the opportunity benefit from sales growth and that type of thing versus protection, and that type of thing?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good question, Vedula. I don\u2019t believe we have in the room with us the exact percentages of the breakdown of rates. How much is in fixed charges, how much is volumetric. We can certainly get that for you and call you back after the call, but in our current rate case, we are asking, I believe for some adjustment upward in the fixed charges. And again the specific percentage breakdown we don't have in the room with us, but it's a matter of public record and we can certainly get that to you later this afternoon.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital", "Yeah, but basically the point is though that\u2019s something that you\u2019re working towards in terms of moving away or diminishing the volumetric component?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, clearly with the \u2013 with what we\u2019ve asked for in terms of modest adjustments in our rate structures and the rate case. We think it would be helpful to move in that direction, meaning a bit away from volumetric and more toward the fixed charge. So the answer is yes.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Vedula. Take care. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference call for today. We appreciate very much your participating. If you have any other questions, Colleen Henderson will be available in the Investor Relations office. Her direct line 414-221-2592. Thanks everybody.

Henderson", "Good afternoon and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's 2008 first quarter conference call. Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language: all statements in this presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. ", "During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. ", "This conference is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analyst for questions and answers. ", "In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information on its 2008 first quarter results at www.wisconsinenergy.com. ", "A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. ", "And now I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Colleen, thank you and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our conference call to review the company\u2019s 2008 first quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation; Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, our General Counsel; Jeff West, Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, Controller. ", "I am very pleased with what we accomplished in the of this year. We received a final order on our retail rate case in Wisconsin and we continued to move forward on our power the future construction plan. We also set new company records for financial and operational performance. Allen will review our results in detail in just a moment. As you saw from our news release this morning, we earned $1.04 a share from continuing operations in the first quarter of 2008. That compares with $0.85 a share for the first quarter last year. ", "Now I would like to just spend a moment or two on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power the Future plan is fundamental to the principal of self-sufficiency. Components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle gas fired units at Port Washington north of Milwaukee; construction of two super critical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city and our plans to build a significant amount of new wind generation. ", "As you\u2019ll recall, back in November of 2002 the Public Service Commission approved the building of two natural gas fired units at our Port Washington site. The first unit at Port went into commercial service in July of 2005 on time and on budget. ", "Engineering, construction, and commissioning for the second unit are now essentially complete and we\u2019ve moved on to final tuning and testing. We fully expect the unit to begin commercial service before the end of the second quarter this year. The cost for unit two won\u2019t be finalized for a while yet as several post operational items must be completed but the unit is projected to meet our financial expectations. ", "Now let\u2019s turn to the status of the two new coal fired units at Oak Creek. At the end of March, the project was approximately 55% complete, with unit one and common facilities at 65% complete and unit two at 27% complete. ", "The project at Oak Creek can be broadly divided into three major systems -- power island, the bulk material handling systems, and the cooling water intake system. I\u2019d like to brief you on the status of each of these major systems. ", "Power island comprises the two units, each with its own boiler, turbine, generator, and air quality control equipment. Our contractor, Vectel Power Corporation, is continuing to focus their efforts on the time critical activities, including the erection and welding of pressure parts in the boiler. Work also continues on the installation of the unit one bag house that will remove particulate matter from the exhaust gas and on the selected catalytic reactor that will remove nitrogen oxides. Vectel is also preparing to install the coal conveyor that will move coal from the new coal handling system we\u2019ve built to the units themselves. In addition, the 345 KV transmission line that will export power from the site has already been built. ", "Turning now to the bulk material handling, our focus has been on clearing the old coal dock in preparation for the new limestone receiving and gypsum loading facilities. Limestone will be used to remove sulfur dioxide from the flu gas. Gypsum is the by-product that will be exported offsite and is expect to be used for the manufacture of wall boards. ", "Elevations for the conveyor systems and transfer towers are proceeding well and ducting for underground utilities is not being installed. Expect this new system to be in service late this year or early in 2009 to support the start-up and testing of unit one next summer. ", "Now I will turn to the status of the cooling water system and later, we\u2019ll address the permitting issue. We have completed all offshore construction of the tunnel and the water intake. The tunnel will provide cooling water to the existing four units at Oak Creek and also to the two new units. Our contractor is installing mechanical and electrical equipment in the new Oak Creek pump station and expects to begin start-up of the system later this year. ", "Now, a difficult winter clearly slowed construction progress at the site. However, Vectel is increasing its workforce to make up for lost time and continues at the moment to forecast that the units will be completed on or before the guaranteed schedule. The guaranteed schedule, as you may recall, calls for the first unit at Oak Creek to begin commercial service at the end of September 2009, the second unit following one year later in September 2010, and we are tracking within the approved construction budget. ", "Also as you know, there are four major permits needed to build the facilities at Oak Creek. These include an air permit, a wetlands permit, a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and finally a water pollution discharge elimination permit. We have received all of these permits and each of them remains in effect unless it is overturned by a court or an administrative law judge. ", "Back in September of \u201905, we resolved all legal challenges to the air permit. Also, in February of \u201906, we resolved the outstanding legal challenges to the wetlands permit. Our permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was received in May of 2005 and this permit relates solely to the building of facilities that are now already complete. To date, no appeals have been launched against this permit. ", "On the last permit, the Wisconsin pollution discharge elimination system permit, a contestant case hearing was held during March of 2006 and in July of that, a Wisconsin administrative law judge upheld the decision by the Department of Natural Resources to issue the permit. Parties opposing the plant than filed for judicial review in Dane County Circuit Court. In March of last year, the Dane County Circuit Court issued its ruling -- the court affirmed and importantly respects the decision of the DNR to issue the permit, also remanded certain aspects of the permit in light of a federal case called River Keeper 2 that could affect power plants nationwide. ", "Following that decision, two threshold questions had to be answered -- whether the new units at Oak Creek qualified technically as an expansion of an existing plant, and whether the water intake system we have chosen is still the best technology available. ", "We believe that the additions at Oak Creek did qualify as an expansion of an existing facility and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources also believed this. However, in a decision last November, the administrative law judge in the case ruled that the units must be treated as a new facility for purposes of this permit. We have submitted to DNR a request to modify our permit and we have provided additional data to demonstrate that we comply with the rules for new facilities. We expect that DNR will issue a draft modified permit for public comment before the end of May. ", "The bottom line is this -- we are convinced the water intake structure we\u2019ve built is the best environmental solution. [inaudible] of the impact on the lake, it results in lower air emissions, less use of coal, and less use of Lake Michigan water than other types of cooling systems. ", "And now I would like to update you on our Blue Sky Greenfield wind project. In February of 2007, the Public Service Commission approved the project as a traditional utility rate base investment. In late March last year, we signed an agreement with Vestas Wind Systems for 88 turbines. Each of the 88 turbines has a capacity of 1.65 megawatts. The cost of this project is expected to be approximately $300 million excluding capitalized carrying costs. ", "Construction began at the site last summer and now all 88 of the wind turbines have been erected. Electrical wiring and mechanical completion are underway and in fact the first wind turbine was commissioned in early February and produced electric power for the first time on February 9. ", "As of today, 52 of the 88 turbines have been commissioned and are capable of producing electricity. We expect to achieve commercial operation of the entire wind farm by the end of May. The project remains on schedule and on budget. ", "Now Wisconsin, as you have head, has in place a renewable portfolio standard that increases from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each of the utilities using an historical base line. Using that base line, approximately 8.5% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015. Meeting the more aggressive 2015 targets will require several additional renewable projects. ", "So to keep moving forward, we have exercised an option with FPL Energy to purchase all rights to a new wind site in central Wisconsin. We expect FPL will transfer the site to us within the next few months -- plan to install approximately 100 megawatts of new wind capacity there, with a projected in-service date would be late 2010 or early 2011. ", "We are also close to receiving a decision from the Wisconsin commission on our request to install new air quality controls on the existing units at our Oak Creek power plant. This would require an investment of some $750 million. Hearings and final briefs on the project have been completed and we expect to hear from the commission shortly. If approved, the emission controls would be scheduled for service 2012. ", "I should also mention two other brief regulatory matters. In January, we filed a rate request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for $22 million. We expect an order from the Michigan commission in the fourth quarter of this year. ", "And on March 13, we filed a request with the Wisconsin commission to increase our fuel recovery rate, driven by the surging price of natural gas and the higher cost of transporting coal by rail. We expect these high fuel costs will continue at least for the remainder of 2008. ", "The commission approved a $76.9 million annual increase which was effective on April 15. Revenues are subject to refund, of course, pending review and final approval. Allen will provide more information on fuel in just a moment, but it is worth nothing that fuel costs have continued to escalate since we filed this request. ", "Finally, before I turn things over to Allen, I would like to give you a quick update on economic conditions here in Wisconsin. Overall, we continue to be pleased with how well our large commercial and industrial customers are faring. Kilowatt hour use in this segment was up 2% versus the first quarter last year. We saw a strong growth in the healthcare, chemical, mining, and primary metal segments. Also, manufacturing of equipment for export markets did quite well. However, we continue to see weakness in automotive parts and in the production of paper products. ", "Growth in the small commercial and residential segments has slowed somewhat on a weather-adjusted basis. Electric usage in these segments grew, again on a weather adjusted basis, about 0.5%. Comparable growth rates that we saw in 2007 for these segments was about 1%. Forecast for housing stock growth and employment growth in Wisconsin have also declined recently but overall, I would say that our economy has held up quite well. We\u2019ll continue to keep you posted as we move throughout the year. ", "With that, I will turn the call over to Allen who will give you more details on our financial performance for the first quarter of 2008. Allen. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, our first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $1.04 per share in 2008, as compared to $0.85 in 2007. I will focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows for the quarter and briefly review our earnings guidance for 2008.", "Our consolidated operating income was $218 million as compared to $185 million in the first quarter of 2007, for an increase of $33 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $207 million for an increase of $29 million over the first quarter of 2007. ", "Before I discuss the primary drivers, I would like to remind you of a couple of developments that caused significant changes individual items in the income statement. First, last September we sold our Point Beach nuclear plant and entered into a long-term power purchase agreement with the new owner. Since we no longer own Point Beach, our results this year do not include operating or maintenance costs related to the facility, nor do we incur any depreciation or decommissioning costs associated with the plant. ", "However, our fuel and purchased power costs this year have increased as a result of the power purchase agreement we now have. Also, as we mentioned in our February conference call, we expect to see a different quarterly distribution of costs and earnings this year as a result of the power purchase agreement. ", "In addition, our income statement reflects $159 million of gain amortization. This item relates to the gain on the Point Beach sale that is being used for the benefit of our customers. The first quarter of 2008 we issued $74 million in bill credits to our customers and we also recorded a one-time $85 million amortization of the gain to match the amortization of $85 million of deferred costs. ", "I would like to briefly expand on these two new items. The January 2008 Wisconsin rate order resulted in about a 17% increase in electric rates. This increase was needed to recover increased costs associated with transmission expense and environment expenditures, as well as the lease payments and O&M costs associated with our new power plans and our continued investment in renewables. ", "However, our customers as a group will only see about a 3% rate increase for 2008 as the balance will be funded through bill credits resulting from the gain on the sale of Point Beach. While we look at the bill credits as a form of revenue, GAAP requires us to record the bill credits as part of the amortization of the gain as we are collecting the cash from the restricted cash accounts and not the customers. ", "However, once all the Point Beach gain has been returned to customers, the full 17% increase will be paid by customers and hence reflected in operating revenues at that point. ", "As I mentioned above, the January 2008 rate order allowed us to use $85 million of the Point Beach gain to immediately recover $85 million of regulatory assets related to deferred fuel and deferred bad debt expenses. This entry had no net impact on our operating income as the amortization of the gain was offset by the amortization of the expenses, but it did allow us to recover cash that had previously been spent on the deferred items. ", "Now with these two items as background, I would like to address the primary drives in our utility operating income for the first quarter of 2008. First, we estimate that the extended cold and snowy winter increased our electric and gas margins by approximately $14 million. We also estimate that price increases to our wholesale customers increased revenue by approximately $10 million. A large part of this increase relates to rates that went into affect in May of 2007, so we do not expect to see a large annual increase for this item. ", "Partially offsetting these items is the effect of the 2008 Point Beach PPA costs in excess of our 2007 operating costs. We estimate that this reduced operating income by $13 million. ", "If you net all of the items above, this still leaves $18 million of positive items. In short, this $18 million represents the net impact of the January 2008 rate order on the first quarter alone. However, I want to remind you that we believe that this January 2008 rate order, taken in combination with the reduction in rate base from the sale of Point Beach, will be relatively neutral on an annual basis. Our rates were set assuming annual costs; however, there are some significant costs that are scheduled to be incurred later in the year. These costs include the Point Beach PPA costs in the third quarter and the depreciation on the new wind farms that we expect to begin in the second quarter. ", "Operating income in the non-utility energy and corporate and other segments, which primarily includes We Power, was up by $4 million. The primary driver of this increase was the placing in service of the new coal handling facility at the Oak Creek expansion. ", "Taking the changes for each of these segments together brings you back to the $33 million increase in operating income for 2008. ", "Other income was down by about $2 million in 2008, the largest negative driver related to carrying charges on regulatory assets. In connection with the January 2008 rate order, we stopped accruing carrying charges on several regulatory assets as these assets were now considered part of rate base and setting rates. ", "Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company are also included in other income and these earnings were up approximately $800,000 for the quarter. ", "Total interest expense was down $4 million. This decrease is largely driven by our ability to capitalize interest related to construction activity. ", "Consolidated income tax expense increased $13 million as compared to 2007. This increase was driven by higher earnings offset in part by a slightly lower effective tax rate. I expect that our effective tax rate this year will be between 36% and 38%. ", "Adding these items brings you to $123 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2008 versus $101 million in the first quarter of 2007. These earnings result in earnings per share of $1.04 in the first quarter of 2008 as compared to $0.85 in the first quarter of 2007. ", "Now I would like to turn to cash flow. During the first quarter of 2008, we generated $344 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is down $19 million from the first quarter of 2007. While net income was up substantially, our uses of cash for working capital were also up, primarily in the area of accounts receivable and unbilled revenues related to natural gas sales. We also expect to collect these receivables later in the year. ", "Cash from operations was also reduced $48 million because of the timing of our contribution to our pension plan. This year the contribution was made in the first quarter, whereas last year it was made in the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $432 million. The adjusted number includes the $88 million of cash impact of the bill credits and the one-time amortization of the gain. ", "Under GAAP, the cash from the bill credits is reflected in the change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From a management standpoint, we consider this an operating source of cash as it directly relates to the bill credits and the one-time amortization. ", "In 2008, we will provide both GAAP and adjusted measures of cash flow. We believe the adjusted measure is more representative of the company\u2019s ability to generate cash from operations for two reasons. First, the customer credits are being funded from the proceeds of the Point Beach sale that are set aside in a restricted cash account as opposed to from operations; and second, once all of the Point Beach proceeds have been returned to customers, our prices and hence customer bills will reflect the full cost of electricity without any credits. ", "Capital spending was approximately $348 million in the first quarter of 2008, which is slightly higher than 2007 but on track with our annual plan. We expect to spend $1.2 billion of capital this year to support the PTF construction program, the addition of wind generation, and ongoing utility infrastructure improvements. In the first quarter, we paid $32 million in common dividends. ", "On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 57.6% as of March 2008. We were at 54.4% on an adjusted basis. This is down from our December 31, 2007 GAAP levels of 58.6% and 55.3% adjusted. ", "The adjusted amounts treat 50% of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is the approach used by the majority of the rating agencies. Given the continued high level of capital spending in 2008 and the fact that no significant asset sales are planned this year, I would expect our debt-to-capital ratio to increase slightly as of December 31, 2008, as compared to December 31, 2007. ", "Our goal now is to maintain our adjusted debt to capital ratio at no more than 60% during the period we are constructing our new gas and coal fire generation. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401K plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. ", "Now I would like to wrap things up with a review of our earnings guidance for 2008. In our February 2008 conference call, we affirmed our 2008 earnings guidance in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share. This guidance was based on normal weather for the entire year, expected earnings contributions from the second Port Washington unit, and a full year of earnings from the coal handling system at Oak Creek. Offsetting these items was the loss of the rate base associated with the Point Beach plant as well as a lower authorized return on equity in the Wisconsin retail jurisdiction. ", "While we were very pleased with the first quarter results, we are not in a position to change our 2008 earnings guidance because of the uncertainty related to the recovery of fuel and purchased power costs. ", "As background, our original 2008 rates were based on natural gas prices of $7.60 per decatherm and diesel fuel prices of $2.84 per gallon. Our interim rate relief in April was based on natural gas prices of $9.23 per decatherm and diesel prices of $3.54 per gallon. Today, just under two months later, the projected natural gas prices are at $10.39 per decatherm and the diesel prices are at $3.96 per gallon. ", "While we do not expect to file for another fuel rate increase, you can see that the continued increase in energy prices will have a negative impact on our business. In our original guidance, we estimated that our annual fuel recoveries would range from between being fully recovered and $15 million under-recovered. Today, with the dramatic rise in natural gas and diesel fuel prices, we estimate that we will have been $20 million and $40 million in under-recovered fuel costs. And this estimate includes the $77 million emergency increase we received effective April 15th. ", "So our full year guidance remains in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 a share. ", "We will not be giving any specific quarterly earnings guidance but I did want to provide some input to you on what to expect in terms of the distribution of earnings for the rest of the year. This will be the first full year that we will be operating with the power purchase agreement from Point Beach. As a result, we anticipate the quarterly distribution of earnings will be quite different in 2008 as compared to 2007. Because the power purchase agreement is designed to resemble the change in market prices throughout the year and those market prices are usually highest during the summer months, we expect the cost of the power purchase agreement will be highest in the third quarter. In addition, because we no longer own Point Beach, we will not incur the higher operating costs during the quarters when the nuclear units are shut down for refueling outages. ", "These factors alone would increase our earnings by approximately $0.08 per share in the second quarter relative to 2007 and decrease earnings by approximately $0.20 per share in the third quarter. Also, keep in mind when you are making projections of our earnings for the second quarter of 2008 that in the second quarter of 2007, we booked a combined $0.08 per share in earnings from the settlement of a billing dispute with our largest customers and the sale of land in northern Wisconsin and upper Michigan. ", "In summary, given these factors, along with the fuel recovery situation, I currently expect earnings in the second quarter to be flat to slightly down as compared to last year. Looking to the third quarter, I expect earnings to be down relative to the third quarter of last year because of the shape of the power purchase payment related to Point Beach. ", "So in summary, while we are very pleased with our results to date, our annual guidance remains unchanged. Benefits that we have realized from the first quarter weather are expected to be offset by higher under-recovered fuel and purchased power costs and also we still have eight months of weather uncertainty ahead of us. ", "So with that, I will turn things back over to Gale. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Allen, thank you very much. Overall we are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and stockholders. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) We\u2019ll take our first question from Doug Fischer from Wachovia.  ", "Doug Fischer - Wachovia", "Just a question about Oak Creek -- obviously coal construction has seen a lot of labor inflation and I know that is one thing that while you had protected yourself quite well against a lot of the escalation we\u2019ve seen, that is one thing you are somewhat at risk for. Can you discuss whether the wage inflation, the added workforce, are issues that could cause the costs to go above what the current budget is?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure. We\u2019ll be happy to address that and if Rick would like to add anything to my comments, feel free. ", "First of all, just to remind you about the manner in which we protected ourselves against wage inflation in the contract with Vectel. Essentially, in Vectel\u2019s budget, they have planned for average annual wage increase in the craft rates of 4%. And again, the average annual is a very important element of that contract, so inflation in terms of the wage rates for the craft personnel of the site have to rise by more than an average annual of 4%. ", "We are fortunate that when we began construction the early years came in slightly beneath that, so while we do have some exposure, there is not question that the contract and the shape of the contract and agreement that we made with Vectel does give us some protection. ", "Now having said that, Vectel is adding workforce and they are going to be paying some higher rates going forward. But I don\u2019t see any huge impact at the moment in terms of pushing us over budget simply from this particular element. ", "Doug Fischer - Wachovia", "And you would, of course, be able to go to the commission to argue the justification for any costs that might take you over the budget?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, the commission authorized basically a dollar amount for the construction and then gave us a 5% additional amount that if prudently spent could be recovered for the plant. But right now we are tracking within the budget, not counting the 5%. ", "Doug Fischer - Wachovia", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Greg Gordon of Citigroup. ", "Greg Gordon - Citigroup", "Thanks. Good afternoon. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Did you make it back from the wilds of Oak Creek?", "Greg Gordon - Citigroup", "We did. It\u2019s an amazing facility -- really truly immense infrastructure project. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "It really is. I\u2019m glad you had a chance to see it. ", "Greg Gordon - Citigroup", "When we talk about -- you talked about the delta on the potential for fuel under recoveries going from a budget of 15 to potentially as high as 40. Given the way your fuel adjustment clause works, is that -- refresh my memory on how your fuel recovery mechanism works and how much of that delta, which is sort of $25 million pretax, might flow directly to the bottom line. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "I will start out and I will ask Allen to add as well. Again, our original financial plan for 2008 in the 280 to 290 range that we gave you was from zero, meaning fully recovered, to $15 million under-recovered. And as Allen is saying now, given the way fuel prices have really sky-rocketed and given our experience in the first quarter, even with the emergency fuel increase that we were granted, it\u2019s looking like $20 million to $40 million. But again, I think Allen stated it well. If you look at the strong results in the first quarter offset with what we expect to be lower fuel recoveries than we had planned or worse under recovery than we had planned, we are still staying within the 280 to 290. ", "In terms of how the fuel clause works here in Wisconsin, it is quite complicated but in an over-generalized term, there is a bandwidth, and that bandwidth on an annual basis is roughly plus or minus 2%. And so if your actual incurred fuel costs plus projected fuel costs go outside the bandwidth, that is when you can seek an adjustment in your fuel recovery clause. ", "Allen. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "In the test that you do, Greg, one might ask well, if you are seeing these increases in fuel costs and you expect further increases, could you file another fuel case? Well, what will happen when they do the plus or minus 2% test that Gale mentioned for -- if you were looking at a subsequent fuel increase, they will assume, they will impute that the interim increase that they gave you was in effect at the beginning of the year for the whole year, so it is pretty difficult to trip again, if you will, and have two interim increases in a given calendar year. ", "So given that and the run-up in the fuel prices, that\u2019s what moves us to the $20 million to $40 million range that I mentioned and that Gale reiterated. ", "Greg Gordon - Citigroup", "So that is in fact an amount that we need to deduct from earnings as being under-recovered, not deferred -- under-recovered and a drag on earnings?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is correct, Greg. ", "Greg Gordon - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Paul Ridzon at Keybanc. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "I have a question on the skewing of earnings from the purchased power. What -- it is going to be an $0.08 help in the second quarter, $0.20 drag in the third. What was the impact on the first?", "Allen L. Leverett", "In terms of the first quarter, I believe we -- well, remember in the rates that we have, we fully recover -- well, that was built in to the rates but I think in the first quarter alone there was a $64 million increase for the Point Beach PPA, but that was included in rates, if I\u2019m taking your question. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "So we should see a $0.12 benefit in the fourth quarter, if there was no impact on the first?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yeah, I think it\u2019s about $0.06 negative in the first quarter.", "Gale E. Klappa", "It was a slight drag in the first quarter. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "If you are looking not versus plan but versus the actual of \u201907, it was about $0.06 drag. So I think it would be closer to a $0.06 drag in the fourth quarter as well. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Six cent help in the fourth quarter? If you\u2019ve got plus $0.02 in the second quarter, minus $0.20 in the third, so we still need to pick up $0.12 somewhere, right?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We\u2019re looking at our sheets here, Paul. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "I think it\u2019s in the fourth quarter, Paul, you would have a turn in the fourth quarter. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yeah, you would have to have -- you\u2019re right, Paul. You would have a turn in the fourth quarter. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "So we were neutral in the first quarter?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, a slight drag, about a $0.06 drag in the first quarter. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Relative to \u201907 -- $0.08 help in the second quarter, again relative to \u201907, and then a $0.20 drag in the third quarter. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "So we should see about an $0.18 pick-up in the fourth quarter?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, I don\u2019t think that big, Paul. Steve, go ahead.  ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "If it\u2019s going to add to zero --", "Steve Dickson", "No, it\u2019s not going to -- it won\u2019t add to zero and the reason is because -- there\u2019s a couple of reasons. One of the reasons is that we lost the rate base and so it will hurt us on earnings because we lost the rate base. So on a year to year basis, it will be a reduction to earnings. The other thing that happened, if you are comparing \u201907 to \u201908, is because of the way the PPA, the costs will be higher in \u201908 and one of the reasons is because there is going to be two outages at Point Beach, so in effect we\u2019ll have higher purchase power. So you can\u2019t say that it\u2019s zero for the entire year. It will be down if you are just looking \u201907 to \u201908. However, the key factor is that the costs were considered when rates were set in 2008. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay, I get it. The 2% band on fuel, what\u2019s that in millions of dollars?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Twenty-million dollars -- so $20 million up or down. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "If we saw another spike in fuel so that you could potentially file again, and you were granted and then prices came down, would you have -- how do the refund mechanics work? Could you potentially get back some of what you had to forego to do your first filing before the refund kicked in? Or would it be -- ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Paul, that would be highly unlikely. I think the way you should look at it is what\u2019s gone is gone. There is very little look back to past -- in fact, there\u2019s no look back to past under-recoveries other than obviously you incurred the under-recovery and we are projecting higher fuel costs, so when you put that together, that went above the 2% bandwidth. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "And lastly, I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m tracking weather about normal but certainly an improvement over last year. Is that what you saw?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, actually it\u2019s colder than normal. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "If you look at heating degree days versus the 20-year average, it was about 8.5% above average.

", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "If you could just -- the other net that we are talking about here, the $18 million, is that the net -- most of that is the net impact of the rate order, correct?", "Allen L. Leverett", "But [some] on the first quarter because as I mentioned in the call, I mean, you\u2019ve got timing of costs within the year but the rates are essentially levelized. But if you look at the net impact of the rate case, taking into account that the reduced rate of return and the loss of the Point Beach rate base, you are really looking at the utility being down in terms of earnings contribution in \u201908 versus \u201907. ", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Could you just go through that again?", "Gale E. Klappa", "In Q1, we did see the $18 million impact but when you look across the year, the rate case will actually be neutral to slightly down, the outcome of the rate case on the utility\u2019s earnings. I think that is what Allen is trying to say. ", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, and that\u2019s because of timing?", "Gale E. Klappa", "In large part, the timing of expenses. That\u2019s correct. ", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Okay, and Greg asked my question on the fuel case, so I think I\u2019m okay on that, on the fuel interim increases and what have you. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Very good. ", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates", "Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Michael Lapides at Goldman Sachs.  ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "A quick question here, just following up from something earlier -- on O&M costs, what should we think as the annual run-rate for O&M costs this year?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Let me take you through, maybe just talk about the first quarter because there are a number of items that go through the O&M account that aren\u2019t probably what you or I would think of as day-to-day operating costs for the business. ", "If you start with the $303 million that we had in the first quarter of \u201907, the first thing that caused the variance, 8 versus 7, was the fact that we amortized about $44 million worth of cost. That was that one-time, the recovery of those costs but we had to amortize those on the income statement and there was an offsetting entry in gains. So there was a $44 million increase for that but then there was $38 million that went the other way because we don\u2019t have Point Beach O&M anymore. So the net of those two together is about $6 million, so that was the $6 million increase. ", "Then we incurred or expect to incur -- we incurred $16 million of additional ATC costs in the first quarter. Then we also incurred $36 million of other regulatory amortizations. So if you put all that together, that adds up to $361 million and what\u2019s left is in my mind, if you look at day-to-day operating costs, it was about a $9 million increase, which is about 3%, which is a long answer to your question but if you look at day-to-day operating costs, I still expect those to be around 3%. So at or below inflation but we still, you know, we\u2019re going to have these other items that are causing noise, if you will, in the O&M account. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "-- noise, Michael, but they are covered in rates. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Right, they are covered in rates, just double-checking. The $16 million of ATC costs, that\u2019s just increased O&M at the AT, meaning literally guys with hardhats at ATC and that\u2019s already embedded in the 2007 rate case?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Some of them with soft hats -- it\u2019s already embedded in the rate case. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Right, so if you take -- another way to look at it is if you take say roughly a quarterly base of $325 million, because that would sort of adjust for some of the noise and then escalate that at 3%. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, so we -- ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Other amortizations sort of ride on top of that. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "So when we think about the year-end run-rate, do you see any other significant changes to O&M besides these items you\u2019ve outlined plus the 3%?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, that should do it. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "No, I don\u2019t see any other items, Michael. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Michael?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Yes?", "Gale E.

How much of that applies to the first quarter?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, we under recovered fuel in about I think $15 million in the first quarter. ", "Maurice May - Power Insights", "Fifteen-million?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Correct. ", "Maurice May - Power Insights", "Okay, and that is gone forever?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Largely, I think that\u2019s the way to look at it, yes. ", "Maurice May - Power Insights", "Okay, good. That\u2019s the only question I had left. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to [Edward Hine] at [Catapult]. ", "Edward Hine - Catapult", "Maury actually just stole my question. I guess the other thing I was going to ask about was just a little bit more color on the wholesale pricing. I think this is the first time we\u2019ve seen it in your earnings walk and I know that Allen, you said it is probably -- it was rates that went into effect in May so it is not going to probably reoccur, but if you can just give us a little more color on what\u2019s gone on there. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yeah, and the reason why it hasn\u2019t factored into earnings releases very much is because before May of last year, I think you had to go back five years before there was a base rate increase, at least for wholesale customers. But Ted, what we implemented in May of last year was a so-called formulary of tariff, so you\u2019ve got a tracker that tracks your [inaudible] costs, so in addition to a fuel clause where you have escrow accounting in the wholesale jurisdiction, you also have this cost tracker. So there was a big catch-up that occurred, if you will, in \u201907 because there hadn\u2019t been an increase in base for five years and now as we go through time, I would expect to see modest increases in wholesale prices. ", "But that $10 million, just to bring it full circle, but that $10 million -- I mean, we already included in our plan the fact that we would have this wholesale increase in \u201908 as compared to \u201907. ", "Edward Hine - Catapult", "And then just to clarify; are these wholesale sales tariff-based or are they kind of like opportunity sales because you are long -- ", "Allen L. Leverett", "These are tariff-based. That\u2019s why I said it\u2019s a formulary tariff. So for example, the primary customer is Wisconsin Public Power and it would be under the terms of a long-term power agreement. ", "Edward Hine - Catapult", "Okay, so this won\u2019t be if you see fuel rising and under recoveries being pressured, it\u2019s not going to be an offset because you have length that is selling into the market?", "Allen L. Leverett", "No, this is a separate jurisdiction. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "-- approved tariff-based rates. ", "Edward Hine - Catapult", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.

Klappa", "Not it\u2019s spring and a young man\u2019s fancy normally turns to the strength of our balance sheet, right, Dan?", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Yeah, I\u2019ve had enough of the cold with winter, so -- ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, the tulips are coming up, Dan. What can we do for you today?", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Snow is finally gone -- just trying to get a little more clarity on the cash flow and then the financing requirements. I guess if you could give me a sense on when this amortization of the gain, kind of how long that will run and when it will fall off, and then be reflected -- ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Dan, the amortization of the gain, and we\u2019ll let Allen fill in all the details, but basically in the form of bill credits, the amortization of the gain will run for three years, particularly for Wisconsin retail customers. So that\u2019s -- you want to think about this over a three-year period for Wisconsin retail. ", "For federal, for our wholesale customers, there will be one-time payments but for Wisconsin retail, three-year amortization. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "And then Michigan is about 18 months, Dan. ", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Will that be a similar size then throughout the period or what we are seeing in the first quarter or --", "Allen L. Leverett", "No, no, it\u2019s very -- I believe it is fairly front-end loaded but you will see this item for the next, you know, at least three years. But you know, I would just stress though what\u2019s built into rates going back to the Wisconsin retail discussion, is the 17% increase. So over time what happens effectively is the gain runs off, what you\u2019ll -- what was an amortization of gain will show up in operating revenues on customers\u2019 bills. ", "So from a cash bottom line standpoint, it is just what account it is coming out of. But from a bottom line, the cash is coming to the company as if you had a 17% increase. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Just a portion of it is coming from the restricted cash account and a portion coming from customers, and that portion, as Allen said, will differ from year to year as the bill credits run off. ", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Right. I was just trying to get a feel for the cash from operations and how that relates to the income statement, but -- ", "Allen L. Leverett", "And I think if you flip to page five of the earnings package, you can see the change in restricted cash is about $88 million. So if you were trying to come to FFO number, then you could take the 344, add all or whatever portion of the 88 from restricted cash you view as operating, at least half of it is, at least the amount associated with the $74 million, and then keep in mind the timing on the pension payments, which was a $48 million cost in the first quarter of \u201908, which we didn\u2019t incur in \u201907 because of the timing of payments is different. ", "I think if you start with the 344, adjust for those two things, you can come to kind of an estimate of the FFO. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Dan, we really think that going forward, it\u2019s appropriate to look at the change in restricted cash as revenue, because in essence, as we get that cash out of the restricted account and into the company, it is taking the place of revenues that otherwise would have come from customers under rates, under the rate case that\u2019s been approved. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "And then in terms of if you wanted more detail, Dan, on the pattern of the credits, we had a discussion in the 10-K where we lay out at least in Wisconsin what we expect the pattern year by year to be in the credits. ", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, and then the last thing I was wondering is, given that the Port Washington and wind is coming into rate, or into operation and the first quarter you have basically $1 billion of short-term debt and your CapEx was ahead of the cash from operations -- what are the financing needs for that coming?", "Allen L. Leverett", "A couple of things on the debt level. Remember of course that during construction, we are putting in effect the construction debt is being, for We Power, is being funded up at the holding company. And then as we do the permanent financings at We Power, we bring that down. ", "So in the first quarter of last year, we had $900 million outstanding. The first quarter this year, end of first quarter we had $1 billion outstanding. But another difference between those two quarters, Dan, is remember we had to buy in our auction rate securities at the utility, so that added $150 million. So apples-to-apples, it\u2019s really 900 versus 850. ", "In terms of financing that I would expect for the rest of the year, I expect to do a financing for the second Port Washington unit. That will be approximately $156 million and in fact, we did the pricing of that last week. That\u2019s a private placement. ", "We expect to reissue the auction rate securities this quarter and then I would expect later this year, probably some time in the fall, we would do up to $500 million worth of unsecured debt at Wisconsin Electric Power Company. ", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Scott [Angstrom] at [Bleinhelm] Capital Management. ", "Scott Angstrom - Bleinhelm Capital Management", "A couple of quick more fuel questions. I\u2019m sure you are having fun with all these fuel questions, so I will add to the pack. Allen, you focused on gas and diesel prices. You did not mention coal. Is that just because of where you are hedged or are there any other reasons?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, in terms of our coal procurement philosophy, we are essentially -- we are covered one year out, so other than transportation costs, which can float and do float with diesel fuels, which that\u2019s why I talked about diesel, really have a locked number on the commodity cost of coal one year out. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "That was included in our rate projection back in the last rate case. In other words, the higher contract price for coal was embedded in the rate case that has been decided and the order in place. ", "Scott Angstrom - Bleinhelm Capital Management", "Got it. Okay, second question kind of thinking about this currency under-recovery and what -- not necessarily a look back but hypothetically let\u2019s say gas prices went to -- I\u2019ll just throw numbers out in the air -- $12 or some range that exceeded the 2% which allowed you to make a filing, and it turned out to be some sort of temporary spike that allowed you to do the filing and then prices came in; would the amount then that you are over earning, whether or not it was actual recover of past under-recoveries, would it effectively be the same thing or would that be held subject to refund going forward?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, any interim increase in fuel that is granted by the Wisconsin Commission is subject to review and refund if circumstances change. And usually the commission takes up to six months once an interim fuel rate recovery increase is in place to do their final auditing and come to a final order. So really by the time we would be getting a final order, my guess is it will be pretty close to the fourth quarter. ", "But let me add one other thing that really takes your hypothetical in a bit different direction -- as the year goes on, we hedge obviously a certain portion of our natural gas costs, a certain portion of our other fuel costs, each month. So as the year goes on, the volatility, unless there is an extreme change in the spot markets for the month ahead or two months ahead markets, the volatility should dampen, not grow. ", "Rick, you agree with that?", "Frederick D. Kuester", "Yeah. ", "Scott Angstrom - Bleinhelm Capital Management", "Okay, so what you are saying then is given the kind of lag in terms of getting these final orders, it is difficult for what I was describing in terms of a temporary spike for you guys to benefit and capture anything you may have lost before?", "Gale E.

Klappa", "There you go. ", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "Just on the fuel costs, assuming that natural gas prices and commodity prices remain flat, I would suspect that in the fourth quarter after getting your final order, you would be inclined to go in for another rate or a fuel clause adjustment. Would that be reading it right?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Nathan, actually again, the rules in Wisconsin require actual and projected to be more than 2% above what you are currently collecting. So again, we would look at the situation at the time but unless our projected fuel costs were above that bandwidth, then we wouldn\u2019t really be able to go in for another adjustment. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "But you are asking for 2009, Nathan?", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "That\u2019s correct, yes. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "So you have to trip the band on an actual basis, so the way -- the scenario you are talking about, say you get your final order from the commission this fall. So then you\u2019d have this new final rate in place. You would take that rate with you into \u201909 and then before you could go back in in 2009, you would have to under-recover on an actual basis in a given month, under-recover and then be projected to under-recover also for the full year. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "And that\u2019s before you can file. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Right. ", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "This is a perhaps a little bit more difficult one to answer, but in a hypothetical situation where gas prices and commodity prices were to remain flat from these levels, what now would be the rate impact of adding the new coal units at Oak Creek versus what you had expected let\u2019s say a year ago?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I don\u2019t think any of us have quite calculated that, but there is no question that once the new coal units come into service at Oak Creek, our fuel recovery clause will flatten or go down. I mean, that\u2019s what we had expected. Now we\u2019ll see what happens with natural gas prices and coal prices. But it\u2019s not going to be a negative, I don\u2019t believe. ", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "Let me ask it a different way -- at what price, let\u2019s say hypothetically natural gas needs to be in order for the actual addition, the savings that you\u2019d get from the low cost coal plants to actually offset the marginal cost of fuel that you would be running otherwise, and therefore the impact to rates would be negligible. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "We\u2019ll have to actually go back and try to calculate that. I don\u2019t think we can do that in the room here without giving you an answer that we -- we want to make sure we give you a correct answer and we don\u2019t -- ", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "But it would be fair to say that the rate increase needed now for customers is increasingly smaller as these fuel costs are coming in higher probably than what you expected maybe six or 12 months ago?", "Gale E. Klappa", "The only reason I think any of us are hesitating is we\u2019ve seen on the spot market for coal pretty substantial increases. I think on the spot market in the first quarter of this year, Powder River Basin coal is up over 20% and Appalachian coal is up over 60%. Now, you look back to last August and natural gas prices are up 95%. But it is so volatile that it\u2019s really difficult to project that far ahead and give you a precise answer. But we\u2019ll certainly give it a shot. ", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "We\u2019ll go next to Paul Ridzon from Keybanc.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Your \u201908 rates are based on your forward look on coal, so how do you protect yourself when your \u201909 coal rates start kicking in? Do you have to trip the bandwidth again?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We would have to trip the bandwidth but much of our, as Allen said, we are covered virtually 100% with contract coal for \u201908 and I am looking at -- and we are probably 60% to 65% covered for next year. So again, that\u2019s embedded in our rates currently. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "But Paul, your predicate is right though. You still have to under-recover on an actual basis before you can come in for interim relief in 2009. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is simply the way the rules work here in Wisconsin. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "I hate to beat a dead horse on this question but I am still a little confused. If we take the sum of the four quarters, skewing -- what will the sum be? Is that the -- ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Are you talking about fuel under-recovery?", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "No, just from Point Beach. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Back to Point Beach, all right. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "I would say it would be about negative $0.12. So if you look at the timing impacts and the fact that, as Steve Dickson pointed out earlier, the fact that these PPA payments effectively are taking the place for us what would have been return on capital, if you net all that together, it\u2019s about a $0.12 negative year over year.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "I thought it was supposed to be just about neutral in the year. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "No, because we lost -- it\u2019s neutral to customers because what they were paying in rates to us is about the same as what we are paying on the PPA, but remember we owned the asset, we were getting earnings. So we are no longer getting earnings from the asset, so that\u2019s why you have negative if you look at a whole year from the sale of Point Beach for the shareholders, it\u2019s a negative $0.12 in \u201908 versus \u201907. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "The $0.12 is the loss of the return of [inaudible] on Point Beach?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, that is correct. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay. I understand now. Thank you. ", "Gale E. Klappa", "All right. Well, I believe that concludes our conference call for today, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for taking part. If you have any other questions, please call Colleen Henderson. She is available in our investor relations office at 414-221-2592. Thank you much. Have a good day.

Such statements are based on management'sexpectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions andother factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors describedin the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differmaterially from those contemplated.

After the presentation,the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. Inconjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website apackage of detailed financial information on its 2007 yearend results atwww.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be availableapproximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "Now I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman ofthe Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin EnergyCorporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Colleen, thank you. Goodafternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our conference call toreview the company's 2007 yearend results. Let me begin as always byintroducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are herewith me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of WE generation; AllenLeverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; Jeff West,our Treasurer, and Steve Dickson, our Controller.", "Overall, I'm very pleased withwhat we accomplished in 2007. We made significant progress on our strategicplan including the sale of our Point Beach's nuclear unit andmeeting the construction schedule for our new natural gas and coal units thatare part of our Power of the Future initiative. We also set new company recordsfor financial and operational performance.", "Allen will review our results indetail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, weearned $2.84, a share from continuing operations in the 2007. Earnings were$2.64 a share from continuing operations in 2006.", "A few weeks ago on January 17, weannounced an 8% increase in the dividend on our common stock. The new quarterlydividend is $0.27 a share, which brings the annual rate to $1.08 per share. Theincrease will be effective with the first quarter dividend payable on March 1.", "This action by our board affirmsthe company's underlying strength and the continued confidence we have on ourlong-term business plan. We have now raised the dividend in each of the pastfive years for a total increase in the quarterly dividend of 35% since thebeginning of 2004.", "Given the projected completion ofUnit II at Port Washington this year, and UnitI at Old Creek next year, I expect that we will reevaluate our dividend policyduring 2009 with the potential to be providing for more significant increasesin the dividend.", "Now, I'd like to spend just a moment or two on ourcontinuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power of the Future plan, asyou know, is fundamental with the principle of energy self-sufficiency. Thecomponents of our focus on self sufficiency include investing in two combinedcycle natural gas fired units at Port Washington, north of Milwaukee, and theconstruction of two super critical, pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, whichitself is south of the city, and our plans to build a significant amount of newwind generation.", "As you recall back in November of 2002, the public servicecommission approved the construction of two natural gas fired units on our Port Washington site. The first unit at Port Washington went into commercial service in the summer of 2005.Engineering and construction for the second unit are now essentially complete,and commissioning work is underway. At year-end, the second unit at Port Washington was more than 90% finished. The unit isexpected to begin commercial service in the second quarter of this year.", "Now, let's turn to the status of the two new coal fired unitsat Oak Creek.At the end of December, we passed an important milestone. The project closedthe year at a little more than 50% complete with unit one and common facilitiesat 60% complete and unit two at 24% complete. The project can be broadly dividedinto three major systems, the power island, the bulk material handling systemsand the cooling water intake system. I would like to brief you on the status nowof each of these three major systems.", "The power island comprises the two units, each with its ownboiler, turban, generator and air quality control equipment. While progress isbeing made across the side, our contractor Bechtel Power Corporation isfocusing their efforts on the time critical activities including the erectionand welding of pressure parts in the boiler.", "In addition, Bechtel is making progress on the unit onesteam turban generator including the setting of the upper casings on the lowpressure turban. The first of six cooling water pumps has also been placed intothe pump station.", "Turning now to Bulk Material Handling, which consists of thecoal handling system and the limestone gypsum system, I am pleased to reportthat the new coal handling equipment was completed and placed in service in thefourth quarter last year. The new system is up and running unloading railcarsand delivering coal to the existing Oak  Creek units. This has allowed us to decommission theold coal delivery system located on the dock area and transfer that area overto Bechtel. Bechtel has now begun work in the dock area to build the materialhandling structures for the limestone and gypsum and the equipment for use for theair quality controls.", "Now, I'll discuss the status of the cooling water system anda little bit later I'll address the permitting issue. We had completed alloffshore construction of the tunnel and the water intake. This tunnel willprovide cooling water to both the existing units and to the two new units at Oak Creek. Our contractoris now completing the onshore civil works associated with the new coolingsystem and is installing mechanical equipments in these and the new Oak Creekpump station.", "I should point out, as we look at progress as a whole, thatNovember and December were very difficult months for construction in Wisconsin with anunusual amount of snow in December that impeded Bechtel's progress. However,Bechtel continues to forecast that the units will be completed on or before theguaranteed schedule, which calls for the first unit at Oak Creek to begin commercial service at theend of September 2009 with the second unit following one year later inSeptember 2010. We're tracking within the approved construction budget for Oak Creek and progress ofthe site continues.", "Now, as you know, there are four major permits needed tobuild the facilities at Oak Creek.These include an air permit, a wetlands permit, a permit from the US Army Corpsof Engineers, and finally, a water pollution discharge elimination permit. Wehave received all of these permits and each of them remains in effect unless itis overturned by a court or an Administrative Law Judge.", "In September of 2005, we resolved all legal challenges tothe air permit. Also in February of '06, we resolved the outstanding legalchallenge to the wetlands permit. Our permit from the US Army Corps ofEngineers was received in May of 2005. To date, no appeals have been lodgedagainst this permit.", "On the last permit, the Wisconsin Pollution DischargeElimination System Permit, a contested case hearing was held during March of'06 and in July of that year. A Wisconsin Administrative Law Judge upheld thedecision by the State Department of Natural Resources to issue the permit. Theparties opposing the permit then filed for judicial review in Dane CountyCircuit Court. On March 5 of 2007 the Dane CountyCircuit Court issued its ruling. The court affirmed, in important respects, thedecision by the DNR to issue the permit but also remanded certain aspects ofthe permit in light of a federal court case called River Keeper II that couldaffect power plants nationwide.", "Following that decision in March of '07, two thresholdquestions had to be answered. The first is whether the new units at Oak Creek qualifytechnically as an expansion of an existing plant and then secondly, whether thewater intake system we\u2019ve chosen is still the best available technology.", "We believed that the additions at Oak Creek qualified as an expansion of anexisting plant, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources also agreedwith this conclusion. However in a decision on November 29 2007, the AdministrativeLaw Judge in the case ruled that the units must be treated as a new facilityfor purposes of this permit. So we have submitted to the Department of NaturalResources here a request to modify the permit, and we expect to submitadditional information in.", "We expect that the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resourceswill issue a draft modified permit for public comment in the first half of thisyear. We have also on a separate track appealed the Administrative Law Judge'sruling to state circuit court here in Milwaukee.We took this action even though we don't believe that the ALJ's decision is afinal order, simply to ensure that we protect our right to appeal. TheDepartment of Natural Resources and the City of Oak Creek have also appealed this AdministrativeLaw Judge ruling and the parties have now requested that all of these appealsto be consolidated into a single case.", "We're convinced that the water intake structure we'rebuilding is the best environmental solution. It minimizes the impact on thelake, results in lower air emissions, less use of coal, and less use of Lake Michigan water than other types of cooling systems.Our plan is to have the first unit at Oak  Creek in service as we set earlier by the end of September2009 on the guaranteed schedule. The second unit would follow one year later in2010.", "Now I'd like to update you on our Blue Sky Green Field windproject that we've been working for a number of months. In February '07, the PublicService Commission approved the project as a traditional utility rate basedinvestment. In late March last year, we signed an agreement with Vestas WindSystems for 88 turbines. Each of the 88 turbines has a capacity of 1.65megawatts.", "The cost of this project is expected to be approximately$300 million, excluding capitalized carrying costs. Construction began inearnest of the site in June of '07. To date all of the foundations andelectrical cabling have been completed, and the turbine components beganarriving at the site in the fourth quarter of last year. 32 Towers are nowerected and are in various stages of mechanical completion.", "We expect to achieve commercial operation of the entirewinds farm by mid year this year. The project continues to be on schedule andon budget. Our new wind farm, by the way, will double the amount of windcapacity operating in Wisconsinand will help us meet the renewable portfolio standard in the state for theyear 2010.", "Now, as you may know, the Wisconsinrenewable portfolio standard increases from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at thestate wide level. The standard sets targets for each of the utilities using anhistorical base line. Using that base line, approximately 8.5% of our retailelectricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015. Meeting the moreaggressive 2015 targets will require several additional projects.", "So, to keep moving forward, we have exercised an option thatwe negotiated with FPL Energy to purchase all rights to a new wind site in Central Wisconsin. FPL will turn the site over to us, andwe expect to install approximately 100 megawatts of new wind capacity there.The projected in-service date for this capacity would be late 2010 or 2011.", "Finally, before turning it over to Allen, I would like toreview the results of our retail rate proceedings in Wisconsin. In May of '07 as you recall, wefiled retail rate cases for our electric gas and steam operations across thestate. On January 17, we received an order from the commission that resolvesall of the cases. Let me briefly walk you through the results.", "The commission authorized $389 million or 17% increase inelectric rates, to recover costs associated with the building of our Power ofthe Future units, costs associated with transmissions, investments in renewablesand efficiency programs and costs related to compliance with environmentalregulations. The commission also authorized a $4 million rate increase forWisconsin Electrics Gas operations, a $3.6 million total increase for our steamoperations and a $20 million increase for Wisconsin Gas.", "The commission reduced the allowed return on equity forWisconsin Electric from 11.2% to 10.75% and left unchanged the financial equityratio range at between 48.5% and 53.5%. For Wisconsin Gas, the return on equitywas also set at 10.75%, but the financial equity ratio was moved down to arange of 45% to 50%.", "Now, I'd like to explain how the 17% electric rate increaserented to the company actually translates into a rate increase of a little morethan 3% for our customers. As you may recall, in our sale of our Point Beachunits, we received more than $900 million of cash proceeds. That's from thegain on the sale and the liquidation of the decommissioning proceeds.", "We committed to use this cash for the benefit of our customers.So on the rate order, the Wisconsin Commission determined that a total of $670million of the Point Beach proceeds would be used as bill credits for Wisconsin retail customers over a three year period.Approximately $316 million of the Point Beach proceeds will beused as bill credits during 2008, $240 million in 2009 and approximately $114million in the year 2010. Therefore, by using the PointBeach proceeds as bill credits, our Wisconsin customers will experience a small 3.2% increasein 2008 and 2009.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Allen who will give youmore details on our financial performance for the past year. Allen.", "Allen Leverett", "Thank you, Gale. I'm going to focus my remarks thisafternoon on earnings from continuing operations. Information regardingearnings from discontinued operations is included in the earnings package. AsGale mentioned earlier, our earnings from continuing operations were $2.84 pershare in 2007 versus $2.64 per share in 2006. On a consolidated basis, our operatingincome was $629 million versus $569 million in 2006 with an increase of $60million.", "Operating income for the Utility Energy segment, which iscomprised of Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Gas and Edison Sault, was $586million compared to $533 million in 2006, for an increase of $53 million.", "Positive earnings drivers for this segment in 2007 includedweather at $41 million, volume growth in our electric business at $15 million, thesettlement of a billing dispute with our largest customer at $9 million and thefull year impact of a rate increase implemented in January of 2006 at $8million.", "The primary negative driver in 2007 was unfavorable electricfuel recovery. This reduced operating income $15 million as compared to 2006. Otheritems in total reduced operating income $5 million. Netting the impact of thepositive and negative factors I just reviewed brings you to the $53 millionincrease in the utility segments operating income for 2007.", "Operating income in the non-utility energy and corporate andother income segments, which primarily includes We Power, was up $7 million.The key drivers of this increase were the placing and service of the new coalhandling facility at the Oak Creekexpansion. This increased operating income $3 million. Other items in totalincreased operating $4 million in this segment. Taking the changes for each ofthese segments together brings you back to the $60 million increase inoperating income for 2007. Other income including our earnings from the AmericanTransmission Company was up $1 million in 2007.", "Total interest expense was down $5 million. This decrease islargely driven by our ability to capitalize interest related to constructionactivity. Consolidated income tax expense increased $41 million as compared to2006. This increase was driven by higher earnings and a higher effective taxrate. In 2006 we recognized approximately $6 million in state tax operating losses;we did not have a similar item in 2007.", "Excluding the benefit of the state item I mentioned for2006, our effective rate was 39.2% in 2007 versus 37% in 2006. Adding theseitems brings you to $337 million of net income from continuing operations for2007 versus $312 million of net income from continuing operations last year. Inearnings per share terms, this equates to $2.84 per share versus $2.64 pershare in 2006.", "Now, turning to cash flow. During 2007, we generated $533million of cash from operations. This compares to $730 million in 2006.However, you should keep two things in mind when interpreting our cash fromoperations on a GAAP basis. First, in 2007, we paid approximately $108 millionin cash taxes in connection with the sale of Point Beachand the liquidation of the nuclear decommissioning trust. Although these taxeswere funded by the proceeds from the sale and the liquidation of the trust,GAAP prescribes that we reduce operating cash flows for these payments.", "In 2007 and going forward, the investing section of the cashflow statement will show an increase in cash as the unrestricted cash isreleased. Back in 2007, we also issued approximately $7 million of bill creditsto retail customers in Michigan.These bill credits were funded by the restricted cash from the Point Beachproceeds. But again, GAAP calls for the same treatment of the cash as describedabove.", "Adding both of these items back to cash from operationsbrings you to an adjusted cash from operations value at $648 million for 2007.In 2008, we will provide both GAAP and adjusted measures of cash flow. Webelieve the adjusted measure is more representative of the company's ability togenerate cash from operations for two reasons. First, the customer credits arebeing funded from the proceeds of the Point Beachsale that are set aside in a restricted cash account as opposed to cash fromoperations. And second, once all of the Point Beachproceeds have been returned to customers, our prices and hence customer billswill reflect the full cost of electricity without any credits.", "So, to summarize, as Gale mentioned, the company willbenefit from the 17% increase in electric rates in the Wisconsinrate order. This increase is expected to have a significant positive impact onoperating cash flows as adjusted. We had capital expenditures of approximately$1.2 billion in 2007. About $540 million of this was dedicated to our utilitybusinesses and $667 million was for the generating units being constructed as apart of our Power of the Future plan. In addition, we paid $117 million individends.", "On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 58.6% at theend of 2007. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 55.3%. These values are ascompared to a 59.5% debt to capital ratio on a GAAP basis at the end of 2006.The adjusted ratio treats 50% of our $500 million of Wisconsin Energy hybridsecurities as common equity. This is the approach used by the majority of therating agencies.", "Capital spending in 2008 is expected to be just under $1.2billion. Given the continued high level of capital spending in 2008 and thefact that no significant assets sales are planned this year, I would expect ourdebt-to-capital ratio to increase slightly in 2008.", "Our goal now is to maintain our debt-to-capital ratio at nomore than 60% during the period we're constructing our new gas and coal-firedgeneration. This is a bit lower than our previous goal of 61.5% and wouldexclude the portion of the hybrid securities that are treated as an equityequivalent by the credit rating agencies. We are using cash to satisfy anyshares required for our 401-K plan, options, and other programs, but goingforward we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "Now, before I touch on 2008 earning guidance, I want toexpand a bit more on the outcome of the rate case in Wisconsin Retail Jurisdiction.Now as Gale mentioned earlier, we received total price increases of $470million on an annual basis across all of our utility operations. Of thisamount, a total of $284 million is going to cover lease payments being made byWisconsin Electric, WE Power, to recover costs that were previously deferredand to cover the projected increase in American Transmission Company's tariffs.", "As such, this component of the increase will not have adirect impact on book income at the utilities, but the balance of the rateincrease will go to cover expected O&M increases and provide a return of andon new investments that are being made at the utilities. To the extent a priceincrease goes to cover an O&M increase, it has no impact on book income.", "Also the reduced rate base from the sale of the Point Beachnuclear plant, essentially offsets the other investments we are making in 2008.This coupled with the reduction in allowed ROE from 11.2% to 10.75% in the WisconsinRetail Jurisdiction means that earnings at the utilities are expected to bedown somewhat in 2008 as compared to 2007.", "Now, there is one other item related to Wisconsin rate case that I believe is ofnote. At the end of 2007, we had nearly $400 million in regulatory assets onour balance sheet related to the deferred fuel and transmission costs as wellas bad debt costs. As a result of this rate case, we have now been grantedimmediate recovery of approximately $85 million of these assets, and almost allof the remainder is expected to be recovered over the next six years throughthe rates that were just set by the Wisconsincommission.", "Now, I'd like to wrap things up with the discussion ofearnings guidance for 2008 as well as the first quarter. Our 2008 earningsguidance remains in the range of $2.80 to $2.90 per share that was provided inour Form 8-K dated January 17th. At a high level, the expected earnings driversfor 2008 are as follows: a partial year earnings from the second unit at PortWashington, a full year earnings contribution from the coal handling and watersystems at Oak Creek and an increased earnings contribution from our investmentat ATC offset by reduced earnings at the utilities that I had mentioned before.", "Now my expectation is that the earnings reduction at theutility will be between $0.13 and $0.23 per share. The biggest variable drivingthis range is electric fuel costs recovery. Our expectation today is that fuelrecoveries for the year will be between fully recovered and $15 million underrecovered. The additional Port Washington unit and the Oak Creek facility should add $0.14 per share,and ATC should add another $0.05 per share. Combining these with the expectedchange of the utility brings you to a year-over-year change between a reductionof $0.04 per share and an increase of $0.06 per share. We're starting at $2.84per share in 2007. Plus this range brings you to the $280 to $290 guidance for2008.", "We will now be giving specific quarterly earnings guidance,but I did want to provide some input to you on what to expect in terms of thedistribution of earnings within the year. This will be the first full year thatwe will be operating with the power purchase agreement from Point Beach.As a result, the quarterly distribution of earnings will be somewhat differentin 2008 as compared to 2007. Because the power purchase agreement is designedto resemble the change in market prices through the year, and those marketprices are usually highest during the summer months, we expect the cost of the purchasepower agreement will be highest in the third quarter.", "In addition, because we no longer own Point Beach,we will not incur the higher operating cost during the quarters when thenuclear units were shutdown for refueling outages. As a result of these factorsalone, I would expect our quarterly earnings to increase by approximately $0.08per share in the second quarter relative to 2007 and decrease by approximately$0.20 per share in the third quarter.", "Also, keep in mind, when you're making projections of ourearnings for the second quarter of 2008 in the second quarter of 2007 we bookeda combined $0.08 per share in earnings from the settlement of the billingdispute with our largest customers and the sale of land in Northern Wisconsinand Upper Michigan.", "So with that I'll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Allen, thank you very much. Overall, we are on track andfocused on continuing to deliver value for our customers and our stockholders.And I believe it's time for Q&A. Our operator will come back on line.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Thank you sir. (Operator Instructions) And we will take ourfirst question today from Greg Gordon of Citi Investment Research.", "Greg Gordon - CitiInvestment Research", "Thanks, two questions Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Hey Greg, how are you?", "Greg Gordon - CitiInvestment Research", "I am good. I apologize if you'd answered this in the contextof the call because I hopped off for a minute. But looking at the renewableportfolio standard in Wisconsin,and looking at your minimum requirements post 2010, beyond the project that youare currently pursuing?", "Gale Klappa", "Right.", "Greg Gordon - CitiInvestment Research", "How much renewable resource will you have to acquire orpotentially have to acquire and if we are all lets say when turbines given thecurrent cost of building them, how much in incremental capital investment mightthat be?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, as you know, we will have to ramp up to the 2015standard. And as I recall, we were probably needing to add roughly 800 to 900megawatts of additional renewables. Greg, you are right, right now, much ofthat looks like wind. But probably we won't be able to do all wind. My guess isthe lion share of it will wind, there may be a biomass project or some otheralternative form of renewable. But by and large the most economic way toapproach it today is wind. And I would say roughly 800 to 900 megawatts ofadditional wind. From a capital standpoint, that\u2019s significant amount of money.My guess is you can look at Allen.", "Allen Leverett", "Today's price, Greg it will be about $2,000 a kw. I would expectit will be somewhat higher than that in the future, but I think it's a workingassumption, assume $2 million a megawatt or $2000 a kw ton scales range so youcan easily get into the $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion range potentially again ifit all comes from one project.", "Greg Gordon - CitiInvestment Research", "So just rough math, because it looks like given your currentcash flow profile you could fund that internally, that's another potential $800million of equity that could add $0.70 a share to earnings over the 10 to 15period, if that were earning what is roughly your current return on equity?", "Allen Leverett", "That's a pretty reasonable assumption, Greg, yes.", "Greg Gordon - CitiInvestment Research", "Okay. Second question is, I know you believe that the waterintake tunnel is going to wind up being the best available technology, or ifnot the best development technology, is still going to wind up being theprimary cooling technology for the plant. Can you tell us what, if any, yourparallel path is to make sure that the plant comes on, and comes on in a waywhere its heat rate and the performance are in line with the contract terms if,in fact, it discloses against you?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure. And I think it's a very good question, Greg. And Ithink to try to simplify it, we have three parallel paths, and I'll ask Rick tohelp out with anything else, if you would like to add. The first path isclearly to work with the regulatory agencies, the Wisconsin Department ofNatural Resources and the Federal Environmental Protection Agency on a newmodified permit, and that work is well underway.", "The second, as I mentioned earlier, is the court appeal ofthe administrative law judge\u2019s decision. A number of us are joined together toappeal the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, not just our company, but theCity of Oak Creek, and the state Department of Natural Resources, which is theagency that issues the permit. So, we have filed and expect the cases will allbe consolidated into a single case. So we have a filed a legal appeal incircuit court here in Milwaukee.", "And the third is really a look that we've had at precedenthere. And I think it's very important to point out that we were permitted tobuild this water intake system. The decision at the time the permit was grantedwas that this water intake system was indeed the best technology availableunder the rules for expansion of an existing plant.", "Well, now the rules have changed in midstream. So we builtthis system in good faith. We still believe it's the best available technology,and we think there is precedent that's clearly evident for when the ruleschange. Once you have been granted a permit and there is, in essence, acompliance schedule or an implementation schedule, it could be put in place.That, if indeed it ends up being cooling towers, then we could open the plantson schedule, operate the plants, and be given time to build the cooling towers,and ultimately comply, if indeed the technology decision turns to coolingtowers instead of the water intake system we've built.", "Greg Gordon - CitiInvestment Research", "You're saying that you think the legal precedent would allowyou to operate the plant with the tunnel as the primary cooling source volumeretrofit at the plant?", "Gale Klappa", "If indeed the decision moves to cooling towers as opposed toour water intake system, we believe the water intake system will ultimatelyrule the day here, and will ultimately be viewed as best technology even for anew plant at this site. But if it doesn't, your conclusion is correct. We thinkthere is precedent here that would allow us to open the plant on time, andoperate until we could come into compliance with a different coolingtechnology. Rick, anything to add?", "Rick Kuester", "No, I think you've covered it Gale.", "Greg Gordon - CitiInvestment Research", "Thank you, gentlemen. ", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Doug Fisher ofWachovia.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "Hi there.", "Gale Klappa", "That's your new T-Shirt with the big W on it?", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "Just in terms of ATC investments in '08, '09, '10, can youshare anything with us about the amount of money? I guess ATC might beconsidered a little bit overcapitalized, at least this one, as someone else whowas another investor in it was telling me. What is the budget going forwardthere?", "Allen Leverett", "Well I guess overcapitalization is in the eyes of beholder,Doug. Something is different, different people will have different views onthat. But in any case, let me talk some about our investment in 2008 in ATC. Ifyou look at our equity investment as of the end of '07, it was just under $240million. I think precisely it was $238 million as what we show on the balancesheet.", "I would expect that we'll make a capital contribution to ATCin the neighborhood of $21 million in 2008. We'll have just over $50 million ofearnings; they'll pay just over $40 million of dividend. So I would say on anet basis, our investment in ATC will go up about $31 million in 2008 if youroll forward from that $238 million number.", "So pretty healthy growth in our equity investment at ATC.Their allowed rate of return course is 12.02%. So I would expect that we'd beable to earn that on an incremental amount of investment at ATC. I'd rather notput specific numbers out there for \u201809 and \u201810 and beyond, but I would say 2009is a pretty similar looking year to 2008 in terms of the capital that we wouldbe putting into ATC. Is that helpful?", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "Yes, it's very helpful. I appreciate that, and byovercapitalized, that\u2019s obviously referring to the regulatory on that. And thencould you walk us through on point, how you are going to be handling thatamortization of that gain on the income statement, on the cash flow statement,on the balance sheet as we go through the next three years?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, I would be happy to do that. And I think before I dothat, let me just sort of make sure, always when I try to understand theaccounting, to always keep guiding principal in my head and it helps me, Doug,and it might help you as well. From the company standpoint, in terms of the waythe income statement at the bottom line, in terms of bottom line on net cash,it's as if we got the 17% increase that Gale talked about.", "From a customer\u2019s point of view, it's 3% in '08 and asimilar amount in 2009 and the thing that bridges the gap between the twoobviously is the use of these proceeds that's been put in restricted cash. Butagain, always have in your mind, when you look at the company segment, bottomline, we received a 17% increase. So, with that background maybe, Doug, turn topage 4, in the earnings package and let's look for a second at the incomestatement.", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "Right, it shows up.", "Allen Leverett", "Right, so in 2007, and I am looking now at the 12 monthsended December 31, 2007, operating revenues will always be reported on a net ofcredits basis. So, whatever the customer pays, net of credits, is what will bereported, shown on the operating revenue line.", "So, obviously to come back to a position where we got therate increase that I talked about, come back to that position on the incomestatement, there has to be an offsetting entry. But scan your eye down theincome statement, to that line item called amortization of gain and it's acontra expense of $6.5 million that offsets, in effect, that net of creditrevenue presentation, and you come back to a net number when you come down onthat operating income, as if we'd see the rate increase that Gale talked about,because that is true from the company's perspective of what we received.", "So just to review, as we provide the credits to show therevenues top line net of the credits, there will be an offsetting entry callamortization of gain on the income statement. Okay, so that's the incomestatement.  If you will flip then --", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "Then, Allen, the amortization is exactly equal to the threenumbers that Gale shared with us, the interest?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, remember Doug the numbers that Gale talked about werefor the Wisconsin jurisdiction alone. Theywill also be providing credits in FERC and Michigan. For the FERC and Michigan, credits will be on top of thecredits that Gale talked about. And in addition to the credits that Gale talkedabout, remember these funds are unrestricted accounts, so we expect that theyall are in interest, I mean they will in interest. So what will happen in 2010,we would expect you give back that interest, but the numbers that Gale talkedabout were just a principal balances.", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "And what's the scheme in FERC and Michigan,is it similar to Wisconsin,or is it different?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, each of the three jurisdictions, believe it or not,are different, Doug. Michigan,what they are doing there is they are giving the credits. We are giving thecredits back over 18 months, and so that began in December of last year andwill go for the next 17 months, so that will be over an 18 month period, asopposed to the three-plus year period in Wisconsin. The FERC amount, I expect,will ultimately be a lump sum but there is an outstanding case at the FERC onthe amount of credits that goes back to the FERC jurisdiction. But I expectwhatever the final amount is, it will be given back as lump sum at some point,and I'm still hopeful that will happen in calendar '08.", "Gale Klappa", "And three years in Wisconsinfor retail customers, and there will be a true up in 2010. I mean, essentiallythe numbers in '09 and '08 that I described to you are in our rate order, andthen as the account or as interest as this restricted cash account or aninterest, we'll see what is there for 2010 and that'll true up. We wereestimating the $114 million in 2010 but that will be trued up, and then asAllen said, 18 months in Michiganand high probability of lump sum for the FERC wholesale customers.", "Allen Leverett", "The lump sum yet to be determined, but the accountingtreatment, Doug, is the same accounting treatment across all the jurisdictions.It\u2019s just varying timeframe over which the credits are given and the amount ofthe credits, okay.", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Well, I thoroughly confused you, Doug", "Allen Leverett", "So that's the income statement, would you like me to move onto the balance sheet treatment?", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "Yes, please.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, okay, if you'll turn to page 5 on the balance sheet,basically what will happen as we provide the credits, we will bring down firston the asset side, the restricted cash balances. So if you look on the balancesheet that's presented on page 5, those are actually broken into two pieces.There is a $323.5 million of restricted cash under investments, and there is$408.1 million of restricted cash under current assets.", "So, in effect, as you give the credits, that cash getsbrought down. As that cash is brought down, you discharge the regulatoryliabilities that are shown down in the regulatory liability section. And thoseare embedded, and if you look at the current liability section, the regulatoryliability line, and if you look at the deferred credits and other liabilitysection, there is another regulatory liability line. Embedded within those twolines are the regulatory liabilities related to this point of each transaction.", "So as we give the credit, you bring down the cash and at thesame time you would lose the regulatory liabilities. So, a couple more movingparts, if you will, on the balance sheet. Okay.", "And then, finally, on the cash flow statement. What happenson the cash flow statement, again, since you report revenue on a net of creditbasis, in effect, cash provided from operations is reduced for the credits onan after-tax basis that you've given to customers. Okay. The offsetting entrythere is in investing. So you'll actually have a positive flow from investingthat comes out of the restricted account. But again, regardless of whichstatement you're looking at, we'll come back to the guiding principle, which isget 17% rate increase as you buy the company and the thing that reduces theGAAP is the unwinded credit. So hopefully, that's all clear as mud.", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "No, that was very helpful, and that was good. Just one lastquestion on the jurisdictional breakdown of the proceeds, percentage wise?", "Allen Leveret", "It's roughly at again, these are rough percentages, 87% in Wisconsin retail.", "Gale Klappa", "It's a little more than 8%, I believe, in Michigan.", "Allen Leveret", "And the remainder would differ?", "Gale Klappa", "And the remainder would differ. And also remember, Doug, ofthe proceeds from Point Beach, $85 million was immediately used forregulatory asset recovery at Wisconsin.", "Doug Fisher -Wachovia", "All right. Thank you. Sorry to torture you with thatquestion.", "Gale Klappa", "", "It's all right.", "Allen Leveret", "Okay, no problem.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "And we will take our next question from Michael Lapides ofGoldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "Hey guys, congratulations on a good quarter and a good year.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Michael. Michael, were you out there with Eli,this morning?", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "I was not out there with Eli, I was actually e-mailing lastweek with oldest brother, and sent along congratulations.", "Gale Klappa", "Good for you.", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "Couple of real quick questions on environmental CapEx.You\u2019ve still got some decisions and the commission still has some decisionsregarding some pretty significant environmental CapEx scrubbers, et cetera, forsome of your older coal plants. We would love your thoughts on when you willgain clarity on that, when the CapEx for that would likely be determined, whenyou would kind of make a go or no-go decision, in terms of going forward withit?", "Gale Klappa", "Good question, Michael. The principal decision that isbefore the Public Service Commission Wisconsin right now is for air qualitycontrols, principally scrubbers, at our four existing coal fire units at Oak Creek. Under ourconsent decree, we would need to either scrub those units by 2012, or retirethem.", "And SCR is also, as Rich is saying. So, we have applied tothe Wisconsin Commission with a formal request to receive approval for movingforward, and basically investing in the environmental upgrades of the existing Oak Creek units, andexpected capital expenditure there would be roughly $750 million. The case iswell underway, in fact public hearings were held last night, and myunderstanding is that in the two public hearing sessions from the public, therewas overwhelming support among those who showed up to testify on behalf ofmoving forward and installing the environmental upgrades.", "I would expect that the commission, if it stays on itspublic schedule, would make a decision certainly in the first half of thisyear, probably by middle of the second quarter. But, that's the biggest one.", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "And when would you start construction for that?", "Gale Klappa", "Rick, immediately?", "Rick Kuester", "Yeah. Very, very soon.", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "A follow-up question. When we think about the bulk of thepower of the future related, especially, to Oak Creek plant when you filed your2009 rate case, how much will be left? Meaning how much of the capital investedare you already recovering earning on, and earning a return on enough capitalright now in your '08 and '09 rates? And how much will you likely file for inthe '09 case? Am I right that we are at a point where you are alreadyrecovering earning on, and earning a return on enough capital, the bulk of theexpenditures?", "Allen Leverett", "We are essentially earning a return on all of theinvestments.", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "Yeah.", "Allen Leverett", "Okay. The return off doesn't start until the unit goescommercial, with those final lease payments. So, in answer to your question,Michael, in this '07 case that separates '08 and '09, essentially all of theinvestments for the coal unit, you got a provision to have a return on thatinvestments.", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "Right.", "Allen Leverett", "So, when you get to 2010, there is little that would be leftthat you have to get an additional increase in rates, at least for return on.Now the return off component or depreciation, if you will, that would have tocome in that 2010, in that 2009 case for 2010, rate making.", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "And I assume it's the same for O&M as well, meaningDO&M on the plant. Once it goes live, you wouldn't start recovering thatO&M.", "Allen Leverett", "Some of that goes as you \u2013 it\u2019s almost pay as you go,because we are of course starting the staffing efforts for the coal plant. Andso, a certain amount of expenses were included in this last case, for that. So,some of that O&M is paid as you go. In fact, lots of people have to hirewell before the plant goes on line, because they have to do training and thelike.", "Gale Klappa", "Michael, I'd like to add to what Allen is saying. This year,2008, Rick's (inaudible) wind group will have about 35 million of additionalO&M, compared to 2007. The lion's share of that is being driven by staffingthat Allen mentioned, of the staffing and training in anticipation of Oak Creek opening, the brand new second unit at Port Washington, and the operation of the Wind Farm. So,much of what you are referring to, Allen, is absolutely correct, is alreadycovered in the rate case that we just completed.", "Allen Leverett", "And just to be, and I'm sure you are clear on this, Michael,but I want to make sure the other people on the call are clear. Your questionto me was about the rate making and how we're covering this caring cost in ratemaking.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Yeah.", "Allen Leverett", "But obviously the rate making, and what's in rates in thecurrent period, is different from the income that's recognized. ", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Understood.", "Allen Leverett", "Okay.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Understood. Lastquestion and this one may be on the easy side, are settlement discussion talkspossible in the litigation related to Oak  Creek in the cooling water towers?", "Gale Klappa", "Well the answer is, yes, they are possible.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Are they under way?", "Gale Klappa", "We've had some discussions back and forth. Nothing to reportat this point in time. ", "Michael Lapides -Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you guys, you'll all have good path, too, then.Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you. You take care.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Reza Hetafi withPolygon Investments.", "Reza Hatefi - PolygonInvestment", "Hello, Raza. How're you doing?", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "", "Good, how are yourselves?", "Gale Klappa", "We're doing well.", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "Allen, I'm sorry if you mentionedthis earlier, but could you give us CapEx breakdown for the next three years,between your existing operations, as well as the Power Of  The Future?", "Allen Leverett", "I'll be happy to do that, Reza.And this detail will also be in the 10-K, that we'll file before too long, butI'll go ahead and give you a preview, so to speak of that. If you look at 2008,so the current year, I would expect to spend right at $1.2 billion on a totalbasis, as I mentioned. $660 million of that I would expect to be at the utilityand the balance would be fully powered for the PPF units.", "Moving to 2009, I expect to spendjust over $800 million in capital, call it $816 million in capital. $592million of that at the utility, the balance at WE power. Then moving to 2010, Iwould expect about $753 of capital at the utility, still a total of $800million for the consolidated group. So, the balance would be WE power.", "So just to review, $1.2 billionin 2008, essentially $800 million in 2009 and $800 million again in 2010. Andthen like I've said, the detailed breakdown and the numbers down to the firstdecimal place will be in the 10-K, but that gives you at least a broad sensefor what we're looking at the next three years, including 2008. ", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "So, that seems like a nice rampon the utility level going to $753 in 2010 from the $500 to $600 ballpark, youguys have been at.", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, and the big, big driver in that as you go from really7 to 8, 8 to 9, 9 to 10, as you look at the utility, is the assumedenvironmental spending. So, as Gale was talking about, you get $750 million forenvironmental, that's sort of sprinkled throughout those years and a bit ofthat $750 is in 2011 and 2012. But that\u2019s what largely contributing to that runup if you will.", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "Great, and then, I am sorry if you mentioned this. Butcouple of other drivers for the year were weather, for both electric and gas$20 million and $21 million pre-tax versus '06. Where were they versus normalweather?", "Allen Leverett", "Actually, it was a pretty modest impact versus normal. As yousaid right there, you just talked on '07 actual versus '06 actual, that\u2019s the$41 million pre-tax. But if you look '07 versus normal it's only a $9 millionswing. So really, I would say that '06 was a bit more anomalous from a weatherstandpoint than '07. '07 was pretty darn close to normal.", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "And, could you refresh us again, I guess you were runningthrough bunch of numbers earlier, but this 284 of continuing operationsearnings. Nice finish to the year versus original guidance. What were the majorcouple of drivers against that.", "Allen Leverett", "Well, as you look at the guidance in October versus where wecame out ultimately. Is that your question?", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "Right.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, well there are really three things. When we gave thatguidance, I believe our conference call was on October 31, so we're justgetting into the heating season in Wisconsin.So, I was a bit conservative on my underlying projection for weather, we didbetter than I expected on weather, we did better than I expected on O&M.", "And then finally, I had to make pretty conservativeassumptions about where we would end up on recovery of transaction cost relatedto Point Beach. So, when we made that guidanceassumption for 2007, we assume little, if any, of those transaction costs,would be recovered. So, it was one of these sort of happy circumstance, whereall three of those key areas sort of broke our way, did better on the revenues,better on O&M, and we were treated fairly, I think on the transaction costrelated to Point Beach.", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "And so the transaction cost is a detriment going to '08 asone of the negative drivers I guess?", "Gale Klappa", "No. The transaction cost would not, that's completely behindus. The negative would be the fact that the sale of Point Beach,actually reduces, I mean comes out of it. It's not an earning asset, onceyou've sold it, obviously. So, essentially compared to '07, where the asset wasearning for nine months of the year, there is about $0.12 differential, becauseit's not in our rate base in '08. Now that\u2026", "Reza Hetafi - PolygonInvestments", "Yes, sorry, yes. Great, great year, appreciate you guys.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, take care Reza.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Paul Ridzon ofKeybanc.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc", "Reza just asked my question actually.", "Gale Klappa", "Alright, well, we appreciate you hanging in there, Paul.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc", "Alright.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc", "Take care.", "Operator", "We'll move next to Dan Jenkins of State of Wisconsin Investments.", "Gale Klappa", "Dan, Happy New Year.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Hi, how are you?", "Gale Klappa", "I wouldn't stand out on this one street too long tonight, itwill be up to you, you know what a snow down, Dan?", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Yeah, I'm waiting for that to stop, myself.", "Gale Klappa", "What can we do for you, Dan.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "I have a few things, just first on permitting litigation orwhatever you want to call it. What's the timetable for that process to getfinalized? Do you have any idea how long it's going to take to get a finaldecision, or is it just really up to the courts and you don't really have aclue or could you give us some insight on that?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure, I think we have a bit of a clue. As I mentionedearlier in the call, we believe the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resourceswill issue a modified water intake permit in the first half of this year. Ithink we're very much on track for, would be a draft permit for public comment,but I think we're very much on track with that. Then obviously, once the DNRgets public comment, they will issue a final permit. The public comment periodis something less than 60 days. I believe for the public its 30, and EPA mayhave 45 days.", "So that\u2019s something less than 60 days, and then after that,obviously an environmental group or someone else could contest it, but again Ibelieve that the draft modified permit we believe and hope, it will give ussome ability to continue to move forward with construction and with testing aswe have been able to do so far. So almost impossible to tell when there mightbe an absolute final court resolution as it goes on through several judicialprocesses. Alright, the key question is do we expect to be able to continue tomake progress and stay on track at Oak  Creek, and our solid hope is yes.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "So, do you expect then a final permit, probably sometime inthe third quarter that would be reasonable?", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019m going to ask Jim Fleming, we go through the draft permitstage public comment, and then the final permit. This is our legal counsel Jimfor --.", "Jim Fleming", "I think we're hopeful we'll get a draft permit around May 1,and then a final permit around July 1.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Okay, how about you mentioned that you are also involved inappealing the court decision. Is there any dockets out for that yet or --", "Gale Klappa", "That one is a little\u2026 there is no timeframe set yet. Well, Ibelieve the first administrative hearing on this is next week?", "Jim Fleming", "Because there were actually three judicial review filings,the three courts that are involved, three judges are involved, need toconsolidate those into one and there is a hearing on that next week, but thatshould not be controversial.", "Gale Klappa", "So we're in a bit of a interesting situation there with thelegal challenge though. Under Wisconsin law,an appellate is not allowed to challenge an order until it is literally a finalorder. And our reading of the Administrative Law Judge's opinion here is thatit is not a final order. So the first, after assuming there is a consolidationof these cases, our appeal, WDNR's appeal and the City Oak Creeks into a singlecase. So the next decision that would have to be made is whether or not we'rein an appealable stage, whether or not this is a final order. Jim?", "Jim Fleming", "Yeah, we actually, probably just we're not in an appealablestage and the AOJ's order is not a final order. We're asking the court for aclarification of that and as you can tell, this really is a protective measureat this point in time. Is to make sure we don't lose our appeal rights. In casewe were wrong and there is a final order and we just sat back and didn't doanything.", "Gale Klappa", "Dan, over time, when one clearly looks at the facts in thiscase, I believe the environmental groups that have appealed this, frankly, arenow in a very difficult position. What they are advocating for is anenvironmental solution that would cost an awful lot more money, it would costcustomers more money and would result in poor environmental performance. But atthe end of the day, this is a very practical state and I believe the facts willcarry the day and the facts are this is the best environmental solution.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "So, I think you've mentioned before, what would be theadditional cost you did have to build the cooling towers?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, certainly north of $300 million.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, we've said $300 million before Dan. We did not finalizethat cost, we're doing some more detailed work, but it would be in the range of$300 million to $400 million.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "And that would be for more CO2, more sulfur dioxide, morenitrogen oxide, more use of lake water, and making an awful lot of nuisance.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Alright, but sometimes since it's the price of being some ofthese procedures. So, we will see how it works out, I guess, looking at yourworking capital on the cash flow statements. You mentioned that part of thatwas, I think, the $108 million for the tax payments related to the Point Beach,but year-over-year difference it\u2019s about $300 million. So, I was curious, whatelse is in there that's causing that difference?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, you add two things really. We talked about the highertaxes and higher affective rates. So, that's certainly affected the cashpayments. And but also it was more about '06 than it was about '07. We had somevery significant improvements in working capital in 2006, if you couldn'trepeat again in 2007 and those were largely Dan the ones in 2006, were relatedto really getting much more optimal about gas and storage, for the gasutilities.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Okay. So, basically '07 is too low and '06 is probably toohigh?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes. That\u2019s why we're looking at it. In terms of the wayworking capital is affecting the years.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Right. Okay. Then you mentioned, the items that affected theearnings, and you already talked a little bit about the weather impact, but youalso mentioned the mine settlement and then you had the '06 rate increase. Thatmine settlement I guess that would -- we should look at that as one-time item,is that correct?", "Allen Leverett", "", "I don\u2019t expect another settlement with them in 2008, ifthat's your questions. That's for sure.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "So what kind of net impact should we think of for the mostrecent rate increase going from '07 to '08?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, let me talk to that, and maybe another way to kind ofthink about the guidance, if you will, and also can get at your question. It'shard to look at year-over-year changes when you are going from a year where,essentially, all your jurisdiction were in for rate cases, and as we thinkabout it, we had Michigan, FERC and Wisconsin cases across all of our products.So it's kind of hard to look at weather impacts and so on when you get so manyrates resets.", "So maybe a simple way to think about it is, start with theloss of earnings from the Point Beach sale and that'sabout $0.12 a share, because we have that for three quarters in 2007, of coursewe won't have it at all in 2008. Essentially that negative $0.12 is offset byrate base growth. If you take the two of those, match them together, and it's azero.", "And now, I will talk about a couple of other factors. Wetalked about the reduction in the rate of return. So, Dan, if you take what isessentially a static equity base of the utility between '07 and '08 factor inthat we expect to earn less on that static equity base. Add to that, theincreased earnings though from PTF and ATC and assume for a moment that we werefully recovered on fuel, okay. You make all those assumptions that brings youto something close to not at, but something close to the high end of ourguidance range, and then you move within the guidance range based on not solelybut a big driver where you move within that range its based on where we end upon fuel.", "Gale Klappa", "So actual fuel recovery.", "Allen Leverett", "Right, so again its little hard for me to talk aboutyear-over-year when you have so many rate resets, but maybe it\u2019s easier tothink of it in terms of those drivers.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Okay, and I was wondering on if you're seen any economic impactfrom the economy yet, as far as either maybe slower residential growth ashousing has slowed down or on the industrial side. I know a number of utilitieswho have said they are starting to see some impacts in a sore economy?", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah, good question Dan. I think, a couple of point. We haveseen customer growth slow a little bit. I think for the year our electriccustomer base grew by about 7/10 of 1% we have been seeing slightly north of1%. So I think from the standpoint of sheer customer growth, we're seeing a bitof a slowdown. On the commercial and industrial side, though, we have not seenit yet. The fourth quarter was actually a very strong quarter for us on largeindustrial electricity usage and commercial usage. Healthcare was up 5% in thequarter, hotels and logging up 4%, chemical production among our large chemicalproducing customers up 7% mining equipment say Joy Global and SirusInternational up very strongly. So many of our manufacturing customers arestill operating at very high levels of capacity specialty steel we has aanother strong quarter and of course we're continuing to see very good, verysolid commercial growth around Milwaukee.So at the moment, knock on wood, we really haven't seen any other than customergrowth, we haven't seen any material impact from the nationwide economicslowdown.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Okay. And I was curious, on interest expense, you mentionedthat's net of the AFUDC given the amount of construction you have gone on. Ijust wondered if you could just give me what the gross is versus the net. Howmuch of an impact does the AFUDC have in?", "Gale Klappa", "So in effect, what\u2019s the cash interest cost incurred by year? If you look at 2006, our cashor gross interest cost, if you will, was $213 million. If you look at our cashor growth interest cost in 2007, it was $241 million. So that gives you a feelfor cash, interest comps, and in our 10-K of course that will be coming outthat will all be laid out and you can see the chart for three years bycomponent.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Okay. And then the last thing I was wondering is, just whythe financing plans are vary? And then also given the fact you also have quitea bit of short-term debt, are you going to maintain that or you're going toterminate that out as well?", "Gale Klappa", "Well in terms of financing that I would expect for 2008 inthree pieces, I would expect the permanent financing for the second gas unitprobably in the April-May timeframe that will be around $158 million. I wouldexpect to do term financing at the utility, so specifically, Wisconsin ElectricPower Company I'd expect to do term financing at that level in this calendaryear up to $500 million.", "And then we're looking at doing up to $250 million of termfinancing at Wisconsin Energy this year as well. As you roll the 2009, at thispoint I don't expect any more term financing at the holding company, wouldexpect to do some term financing at the utility and then we would do the firstpermanent financing expected the first permanent financing for a coal unit in2009.", "Dan Jenkins - Stateof WisconsinInvestment", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Great. Thank you for your questions.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Edward Heyn withCatapult Capital Management.", "Gale Klappa", "Good afternoon, how are you?", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "Good, how are you doing?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes, fine.", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "Good. Just wanted to ask you a quick question on the newpermit that the DNR is looking at. I know that you guys sent some comments tothem after the ALJ decision stating your case. Can you kind of walk through howthey are going to judge this new permit?", "Gale Klappa", "Pretty simply, I think we can capitalize it for you, Ed.There are set of rules under the Federal Clean Water Act which set out thecriteria by which a permitting agency like the State Department of NaturalResources here in Wisconsin, the set of criteria that they must look at to maketheir decision. The set of criteria, there are three tracks under these sets ofcriteria that they can walk down and apply the criteria against the technologyand the criteria by the way allow a decision that is very site specific.", "So, that's what the DNR will be looking at. Their frameworkis the Federal Clean Water Act rules as promulgated by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and then specifically, the tracks under which they aresupposed to examine with specific criteria of how to make this decision. Andagain the permitting agency in this case the Wisconsin Department of NaturalResources has not only the leeway but the ability to make a very site specificdecision for the individual plant site. Jim, anything to add?", "Jim Fleming", "No, thanks.", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "Okay. And then you mentioned that you would expect anappeal, in the best case scenario you get this permit and it's a new permit, sothe appeal clock starts over?", "Gale Klappa", "I didn't say I expect an appeal. I said an appeal will bepossible as a rule, but we have no way of knowing whether there would be appealor not.", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "Okay. If the environmental agencies were to issues anappeal, could that process stretch on into your kind of in-service and doesthat cause any problems if it gets to that point?", "Gale Klappa", "I wouldn't expect the environmental agencies to lodge anyappeal because after the comment period, basically both the WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources and the Environmental Protection Agency at thefederal level would have had their opportunity to comment.", "So assuming the draft permit goes final, then it would onlybe an environmental group that might want to appeal. And certainly given thelack of speed in the court system, appeals could go on literally for years ifthey were taken to several different levels of judicial review. But again Ithink the important point is we believe there is President or basically acompliance or implementation schedule that would allow the plant to open whenconstruction is finished and then use the current system we have in place, thewater in-take system in place, until a final decision through the courts wouldbe made if there is a court appeal related to what is, at the end of the day,the best available technology.", "Unidentified CompanyRepresentative", "We certainly believe the regulatory agencies have thatdiscretion, and we'll certainly ask them to exercise that discretion.", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "Got you. And then just one last quick question, youmentioned that the current rate deal is 3% increase for the credits over thefirst two years.", "Gale Klappa", "3.2% a year Ed.", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "And what does that equate to on the last, in 2010?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, in 2010 we can't really you give you affirm answerbecause we will be filing another case in '09 for rates that would go intoeffect in January of 2010. There will be some bill credits still remaining tohelp offset whatever increase we apply for in 2010 until we really but we'relong way away from filing a case for 2010 rates.", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "I guess that was kind of to my question because if you justlook at it without another rate increase, isn\u2019t the rate increased from '09 to'10 just on this decision going to be almost a double-digit increase? And thendoes that cause problems when you are in front of the commission again for your'09 rate cases because I was kind of getting out?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, I\u2019m not sure you get the double-digit numbers quite,because it's really going to depend upon what amount of bill credits are stillremaining in this restricted cash account in 2010, and we believe there shouldbe at least $140 million of bill credits remaining in 2010. So I really don'tthink it's my current belief, again a lot is going to turn on what happens tofuel prices going forward, that's going to be a very big variable for allutilities, but for a moment I don't see it has been draconian rate case, Ireally don't.", "Edward Heyn -Catapult Capital Management", "Okay, great. Well I appreciate the color. Thanks a lot.", "Gale Klappa", "You're more than welcome Ed. Thank you very much. And thatconcludes our conference call for today ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so muchfor participating.

This conference is being recorded to rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information on its 2008 year-end results at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Carlene, thank you very much. Good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our conference call to review the company\u2019s 2008 year-end results. Before we proceed with our normal format, let me just mention one very quick thing that some of you may have heard on the news within the last two hours. Apparently at about 11 O\u2019clock this morning, we had an explosion in the coal handling area of the Oak Creek Power Plant.", "Now, this area is where the coal trains are unloaded. The facilities are new, but the facilities are operational, so not under construction. We had contract workers in making some repairs in that area and apparently this is an area where coal dust can build up and apparently we had an explosion. From what we\u2019ve learned so far from the site, there are approximately five injuries, we believe that four maybe critical.", "The situation at the site is stabilized, the plants are continuing to operate the existing Oak Creek units are continuing to operate. This area is relatively far away from the power block of the new constructions for the two new units, but we wanted to make you aware of the incident that occurred at about 11 O\u2019clock this morning.", "Let me begin, our call as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of Regeneration; Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; Jeff West, our Treasurer and Steve Dickson, our Controller.", "Allen, of course will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our new release this morning, we\u2019ve reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $3.03 for 2008, this compares with $2.84 a share for 2007. While we did see a decline in sales of electricity to our commercial and industrial customers because of the slowdown in the economy, our 2008 earnings were boosted by our power of the future investment in the newest generating unit at Port Washington, by the strong customer demand for natural gas during the cold winter months in 2008 and by effective cost controls across our business.", "Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with our performance. With customer satisfactions and network reliability to progress on our power of the future plan, the company made great strides during the year and in a tough economy, we posted solid financial results.", "Now I\u2019d like to touch briefly on the impact of the economic climate is having on our service area. Generally, our region has a well-diversified industrial and commercial base, which tends to help mitigate the impact of economic downturns. However, in this economy, we\u2019re seeing three sectors that have been dramatically affected, primary metals such as foundries and specialty steel companies, automotive and automotive part production and paper production led by declines of these three sectors, our electricity sales to large commercial and industrial customers declined by 9% in the fourth quarter, as compared with fourth quarter of 2007.", "At this point though, based on what we\u2019ve seen in January, we don\u2019t see a need to modify our 2009 sales forecast that we provided you in December. As you would expect, we\u2019re also seeing a slight increase in past due receivables. You may remember; that we currently have some protection in Wisconsin, because we use escrow accounting for any residential bad debt above the level currently collected in rates. We\u2019re actively monitoring also our past due accounts and we\u2019re working with customers on payment plans. On a more positive note, we expect to see at least a 10% increase in state and federal energy assistance dollars for our residential customers this year.", "Now, I\u2019ll spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our power of the future plan is fundamental with the principal of energy self sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self sufficiency, include investing in two combined cycle gas-fire units in Port Washington, North of Milwaukee, the construction of two super-critical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is South of the city and building a significant amount of renewable generation.", "As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, all units at Port Washington in our complete and in service. Instructions was finished on time and on budget, the units are among the most efficient in the Midwest market, they are operating well and our customers are now benefiting from the low price of natural gas that fuel these units.", "Let me turn now to the status of the two new coal-fired units at Oak Creek. As you may recall in last summer, we have the two other owners of the expansion units at Oak Creek reached an agreement with Clean Wisconsin and Sierra Club. The groups that had been actively opposing a water intake permit for the plant.", "Under the settlement agreement, the environmental groups withdrew their opposition, just brought to a close the ongoing litigation and administrative challenges to the permit. Few months later, the deadline past for any appeals of the water intake permit, so all litigation matters regarding the permits of the Oak Creek expansion are resolved.", "On the construction front, based on Bechtel\u2019s revised schedule Unit 1 and the common facilities were at 85% complete at the end of December and Unit 2 was approximately 37% complete. Bechtel continues to target commercial operation of Unit 1 by the end of this year, by the end of 2009 and Unit 2 by the end of August of 2010. Progress this winter has improved versus last winter, in part because many of the critical buildings are enclosed and largely projected from the weather.", "Progress on Unit 1 is gradually shifting now from constructions to commissioning. In fact, the numbers of the systems are already in start-up phase and I\u2019m really pleased to report that the cooling water intake system was placed in the commercial services just few days ago on January 18. This means we\u2019re drawing water through the tunnel supplying it to the four existing units of Oak Creek site.", "Of course the tunnel will also supply cooling water to the new units when they go operational. Since our last call, we\u2019ve also successfully unloaded limestone at the site using the newly build dock equipment and storage facilities. We\u2019ve also taken delivery of our first train load of the two unit\u2019s coal, which will be used to commission the new units.", "Most time critical activities remain in the power block at the Oak Creek, it was also focused on completing the air quality control equipment and the duct work to allow first fire-on-gas to occur this summer. We\u2019re also working on the air, water, chemical and lubrication systems of our essential to be operation of the plant. Despite the schedule delay, we\u2019re pleased with the progress being made at the site.", "Of course, as we told you on December, Bechtel filed a formal claim seeking relief under the contract. Bechtel deciding a number of factors that they believe have caused a change in the schedule. The factors include weather conditions in the two most recent winters, heavy rains this past spring and what Bechtel believes to be changes in local labor conditions. The claims for schedule and cost relief related to these factors totaled $413 million. Bechtel also stated its belief that the weather events constitute a force majeure.", "Now, we don\u2019t believe there is a contractual basis for some of the claims that Bechtel has submitted. For example, we disagree that Bechtel is entitled to either cost or schedule relief as a result of the alleged changes in the local labor market. Bechtel also filed a $72 million claim for the alleged effects of changes and delays prior to the issuance of the full notice to proceed with construction in July of 2005. We believe this claim is without merit and as Bechtel was fully compensated for any and all impacts of the delayed start.", "Finally, Bechtel have asked for six months of relief from liquidated damages, beyond the September 29, 2009 guarantee date for Unit 1 and the three months of relief from liquidated damages beyond the September 29, 2010 date for Unit 2. We\u2019re reviewing the claims; we\u2019ve asked Bechtel for additional information. We expect the claims to be a resolved through the contracts formal dispute resolution process. If we\u2019re not able to reach agreement in non-binding mediation, we will move to binding arbitration, which is called for under the contract.", "Now, as we assess these developments, I believe there are several key points to keep in mind; first, we\u2019re still recovering carrying costs associated with the construction of these units. So, under the terms of the lease agreements, between Wisconsin Electric and W.E. Power, we are recovering based on a mix of debt and equity, our capital carrying costs as construction continues on the Oak Creek Project. We\u2019re allowed to recover our carrying costs up to the total budget for the project, that\u2019s been approved by Wisconsin Commission.", "So we believe our ability to recover cash carrying costs should be largely unaffected by the slight in the construction schedule. I would also like repeat the point I made last fall, about the ultimate recovery of any potential cost increases. We believe that we have several important layers of protection for recovery of our costs. For example, to conclude that an additional cost is not ultimately recoverable, we would have to believe that the cost will not qualify for recovery under at least four opportunities.", "First, that the remaining contingency in the project is not sufficient to offset the cost. Second; that the cost would fall outside the 5% band that that the commission has deemed as reasonable or prudent costs above the approved amount for the project. Third; that the cost was not caused by a force majeure event as defined by the lease agreements. And finally, after an opportunity to demonstrate prudency that the costs would be ultimately deemed to be improved.", "One more important point, liquidated damaged payments will be due from Bechtel on Unit 1, unless it is determined at any days that maybe granted for weather release, equal or exceed the delays in the schedule. As we move forward, we will continue to provide updates to you on any major developments with the claims through our SEC filings and on our regularly scheduled calls.", "I\u2019ll turn now to the subject of renewables. The state of Wisconsin as you will recall has enacted a renewable portfolio standard that increases from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standards sets targets for each of the utilities using an historical baseline, using that baseline approximately 8.5% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in the year 2015.", "Meeting the aggressive 2015 targets will require several additional projects. Of course, with the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm in 2008, we took a major step toward meeting Wisconsin\u2019s goal to reduce its carbon footprints, with a total of 88 turbines, each with a capacity of 1.65 megawatts. Blue Sky Green Field is the largest wind farm to-date in Wisconsin. It was completed last year under budget and ahead of schedule.", "To continue on a path of carbon reduction, we exercised an option with FPL Energy and acquired in excellent wind site in East Central Wisconsin in Colombia County. In October of last year, we filed for our approval to build our newest wind project, which is called the Glacier Hills Wind Park. The public service commission deemed our application to be complete just a few days ago on January 27. So, the commission\u2019s 180-day review period has now begun.", "The site can accommodate between roughly 130 and 200 megawatts of new capacity, depending on the final layout and the turbine equipment that we select. The first full-year of operation for Glacier Hills is expected to be 2012 and just a reminder of that construction is also underway on a major upgrade of the air quality control of the existing coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We expect the cost of this facility will be roughly $885 million including allowance for funds used during construction with the instillation of wet flue gas de-sulfurization and selected catalytic reduction facilities. These controls should be completed in 2012.", "As we look ahead, we expect to file a general rate case on our normal cycle for our Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas utilities in the first half of this year. The rate cases as you recall in Wisconsin are based on forward-looking test periods. Hearings should take place this fall and we would expect that new retail rates would go into effect in January of 2010.", "Finally last December, our Board of Directors approved a new dividend policy for Wisconsin Energy\u2019s common stock. Our new policy as you recall provides for an annual dividend of $1.35 a share in 2009, which is a 25% increase over the dividend in 2008. Our policy also targets a dividend pay out ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings in each year from 2009 through 2011 and 45% to 50% after 2011. The first quarterly dividend for 2009, which was declared by our Board a few days ago will be payable on March 2, at a rate of $33.75 a share.", "Now I will turn the call over to Allen, who will give you more details on our financial performance for 2008. Allen.", "Allen Leverett ", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2008 year-end earnings from continuing operations were $3.03 per share. I will focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows for the year and discuss our earnings guidance for 2009. Now, you may want to refer to page seven of the earnings package as I make my remarks.", "Our consolidated operating income in 2008 was $661 million as compared to $629 million in 2007 or an increase of $32 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $582 million, a decrease of $4 million versus the last year. Before I discuss the primary drivers, I would like to remind you of a couple developments that caused significant changes in individual items in the income statement.", "First, in September of 2007 we sold our Point Beach Nuclear Plant and entered into a long-term power purchase agreement with the new owner. Since, we no longer own Point Beach, our results in 2008 did not include operating or maintenance costs related to this facility nor did we incur any depreciation of the commissioning costs associated with plant. Of course, our fuel and purchase power cost increased as a result of the power purchase agreement we now have.", "Our income statement in 2008 reflected $488 million related to the amortization of the gain on the Point Beach sale. The amortization included a one-time refund of $62.5 million to our wholesale customers, a one-time amortization of $85 million offsets certain regulatory assets and the balance related to bill credits that were provided to our Wisconsin Electric retail customers in Wisconsin and Michigan.", "I would like to briefly expand on this item. The January 2008, Wisconsin rate order resulted in about a 17% increase electric rates. This increase was needed to recover higher costs associated with transmission expense and environmental expenditures as well as the lease payments in O&M costs associated with our new power plants and our continued investment in renewables.", "However, our customers as a group saw only about a 3% rate increase in 2008 rate order, as the balances is being funded through bill credits from the gain on the sale of Point Beach. In 2009, we expect the bill credits will total approximately $242 million. While we look at the bill credits as a form of revenue, GAAP requires us to report the bill credits as part of the amortization of the gain, because we\u2019re collecting the cash from the restricted cash accounts and not from customers. As we have previously discussed, once all the Point Beach gain has been returned to customers, the full 17% increase will be paid by customers and at that point reflected in operating revenues.", "With this as background, I would like to address the primary drivers in our utility operating income for 2008. First, price increases to our retail and wholesale customers resulted in $165 million increase in revenues. The conversion of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant for being an asset owned by Wisconsin Electric to an owned by FPL Energy with an associated power purchase agreement, reduced operating income $116 million.", "Additional planned operations and maintenance expenses at our power plants decreased operating income $37 million. All other factors in this segment reduced operating income to net $16 million. Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which primarily includes We Power, was up $41 million. The key drivers of this increase were a full years earnings contribution from the new coal handling facility at the Oak Creek expansion, which was placed into service in October of 2007 at a cost of approximately $175 million and a partial year of earnings contribution from Unit 2 at Port Washington, which was placed into service in May of 2008.", "Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $10 million in 2008, compared to an operating loss of $5 million from 2007. This decrease was primarily related to reduce real estate sales during 2008. In the future, we project to have only slight operating losses in this area, as we expect to have minimal business operations in this segment. Taking the changes for each of these segments together brings you back to the $32 million increase in operating income for 2009.", "During 2008, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company decreased $9 million. Other income declined $33 million because of lower carrying costs on regulatory assets. These regulatory assets are now component of rate base, so the carrying costs are included in revenues rather than other income.", "Total interest expense was down $14 million; although we do have higher gross interest expense because of increased debt levels associated with our construction programs. Our gross interest expense was reduced by lower short-term interest rates and higher capitalized interest.", "Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $1 million because of higher pretax earnings. Our effective tax rate for 2008 was 37.7%, compared to 39.1% last year.", "I expect that our effective tax rate in 2009 will be between 35% and 37%. Combining all of these items brings you to $358.6 million of net income from continuing operations for 2008 for earnings of $3.03 per share.", "During 2008, we generated $737 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $205 million from the same period in 2007. This increase was primarily driven by higher cash earnings as a result of better recovery of regulatory assets and reduced cash taxes. On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $1.82 billion. The adjusted number includes the $345 million of cash impact from the bill credits and the one-time amortization of the gain.", "Under GAAP, the cash from the bill credits is reflected in the change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity, but from a management standpoint, we consider this as a source of cash as it directly relates to the bill credits and the one-time amortization. We plan to provide both GAAP and adjusted measures of cash flow as long as the bill credits continue.", "We believe the adjusted measure is more representative of the company\u2019s ability to generate cash from operations for two reasons. First, the customer credits are being funded from the proceeds of the Point Beach sale that are set aside in a restricted cash account and second, once all of the Point Beach proceeds have been returned to customers, our prices and hence customer bills will reflect the full cost of electricity without any credits.", "During 2008, we completed nearly $1 billion in long-term debt financings. The proceeds were used to provide long-term financing for Port Washington Unit 2, as well as to reduce short-term debt balance into both Wisconsin Energy and the operating companies. These offerings largely mitigate the need for long-term debt offerings in 2009, and allowed us to fund a $289 million contribution for our pension plans and other post employment benefit trusts in January of this year.", "Looking to 2010, we expect to complete nearly $900 million in long-term financing in We Power in connection with the completion of the new units at Oak Creek. On a consolidated basis, we have approximately $1.6 billion of available undrawn credit facilities that expired in March and April of 2011. Our commercial paper balances at the end of 2008 were approximately $600 million on a consolidated basis.", "This balance is well within the limits of our credit facilities. The Commercial Paper at the Wisconsin Energy level is primarily being used to provide construction financing for the Oak Creek Units, while the Commercial Paper at the operating utilities is used to provide working capital.", "Now I would like to move on to a discussion of capital expenditures in 2008. Our total capital expenditures were approximately $1.1 billion in 2008, about $607 million of this was dedicated to our utility businesses and $529 million was from generating units being constructed as part of our Power the Future plan.", "In 2009, we expect to spend between $825 million and $875 million of capital to support our Power the Future construction program, additional wind generation and ongoing utility infrastructure improvements. At the $825 million level, we will about $10 million below our previous forecast of 2009 capital spending. We also paid $126 million in common dividends in 2008.", "On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 58.5% as of December 31 and we were at 55.4% on an adjusted basis. This is essentially flat compared to our December 31, 2007 levels of 58.6% and 55.3% adjusted. The adjusted amounts treat half of our $500 million in hybrid securities as common equity, which is the approach used by the majority in the rating agencies.", "I would expect our debt-to-capital ratio to increase slightly as of December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008. Our goal remains to maintain our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at no more than 60% during the period we\u2019re constructing our new coal-fired generation. We\u2019re using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "As we discussed on our last conference call, given market returns in 2008, we expected to make significant contributions to the trust that find our pension and other post employment benefits. I expect that our FAS 87 pension expense will be about $22 million, which is roughly the level as compared to last year.", "Now, I would like to wrap things up with the discussion of earnings guidance for 2009, as well as the first quarter. Our 2009 earnings guidance remains in the range of $3.5 to $3.15 per share that was provided in our press release last December. We expect the primary earnings drivers in 2009 to be as follows. A negative impact of the downturn in the economy, continued implementation of our Power the Future plan, including a full-year earnings contribution from the second unit at Port Washington and the water system at Oak Creek and an increased earnings contribution from our investment in ATC.", "The full-year earnings contribution from the second unit at Port Washington and water system at Oak Creek should add $0.11 per share. I estimate that the downturn in the economy will reduce earnings about $0.15 per share net of the O&M actions we have taken in response. An increase in the earnings contribution from ATC and other small items should add a total of $0.06 per share. Combining these factors brings you to a year-over-year increase of $0.02 per share. So, staring at $3.03 per share in 2008 plus $0.02 brings you the low end of our $3.5 to $3.15 guidance range for 2009.", "You will note that I did not mention electric fuel cost recovery as a variable driving our estimated range of earnings this year. At this point, our expectation is that we will be in a fully recovered position in 2009, which is where we ended up in 2008. Essentially, the increase in the cost of coal is expected to be offset by the substantial drop in natural gas and diesel fuel prices that have occurred in the past few months.", "We expect a total earnings contribution of $0.39 per share from our Power the Future program in 2009. This includes a full calendar year contribution from the two units at Port Washington as well as the water and coal handling systems at Oak Creek. We will not be giving specific quarterly earning guidance, but consistent with our past practice, I will provide you some input on what we expect in terms of the distribution of earnings within the year.", "As we discussed in the past, our fuel recoveries have a significant impact on our quarterly earnings. Last year, we were in under-collected position in the first quarter and in July. We received relief for higher rates to cover the increased fuel costs. During 2009, we expect to be in an over-collected position for the first quarter because of the significant decline in natural gas prices.", "In addition to 2008, we did not receive the benefit of earnings on our Port Washington unit until it went into service at May of 2008. This year we will benefit from earnings in all four quarters. So, with that I will turn the things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa ", "Allen, thank you very much. As you can tell from report we had a very solid year both operationally and financially. We are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research", "Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research", "When I try to think about the rate filling that you are going to make in the first half of this year, you use a forward test here, correct?", "Gale Klappa ", "It would be a two-year forward-looking test year.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "So we\u2019ll be looking at sort of 2010 average rate base.", "Gale Klappa ", "Well again, two-year forward-looking test years, so we would look at 2010 and 2011 at 2010 and 2011 rate base.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Citi Investment Research", "Great and rate base includes, CapEx minus depreciation obviously, but plus does that also include any dollars that you put into the pension including that $289 million you put in January?", "Gale Klappa", "It\u2019s meant to include the total capitalization of the company, Greg. So, to the extent that you invest in working capital, your inventories all that, a whole range of things to drive capitalization get included in the rate making formula.", "Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research", "The point being that is, it\u2019s seen as funds on which you ought to be allowed to recoup your investment?", "Gale Klappa", "That\u2019s right.", "Rick Kuester", "It seen as part of the capital base of the company, that\u2019s right.", "Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research", "Okay, I just wanted to make sure. Looking at where interest rates and equity risk premiums have gone over the last year, would it be your expectation that you be requesting a the higher return on equity in the case, same lower and how are you thinking about positioning for the case?", "Gale Klappa", "Greg, candidly, I don\u2019t think we would be asking for a higher return on equity than we\u2019re currently allowed. In part, I think we have to be in the commission would expect us to be sensitive to the economic climate. So, my sense is that at this stage of the game, again we haven\u2019t put all the final pieces together yet for the filing, because that wont take place for a number of bunch yet.", "My sense is, we would stay at a request of a 1075 return on equity and that the big driver actually and if you look at where we\u2019re at, about 83% of all the Power the Future costs are already reflected in rate decisions of the commission has already made. So, one of the drivers for this upcoming case, as we know bring these units into services will be the remaining carrying costs on our Power the Future investment, but I think you will see based on all of the things we\u2019re doing in the company. I think you\u2019ll see a pretty modest rate increase request.", "Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research", "Great and when did the Bill credits associated with the nuclear asset sale roll off?", "Gale Klappa", "Periodically, they would roll off in 2011", "Greg Gordon - Citi Investment Research", "So, there is another year of them and to the\u2026", "Gale Klappa", "About a full-year of them, no question about that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Fleishman - Catapult.", "Ted Hine - Catapult", "It\u2019s actually Ted Hine. I just have a quick question. I think, Allen mentioned that the fuel recoveries, but also just on weather. Could you give us a feeling a sense of where you stand on at the end of \u201808 on actual benefits or hurt from weather and also on fuel recoveries?", "Allen Leverett ", "Weather, Ted was almost a neutral, if you combine gas and electric together, cooling degree days were down in 2008 versus 2007. So, we had a cooler than normal summer, but then of course also a cooler than normal January and December of 2008. So, when you combine the two factors at a consolidated level, almost a neutral impact of weather.", "Gale Klappa ", "Actually my wife says we had no summer, on this ride and just to break that down for Q4, we had a, a very cold December of 2008 very cold. In fact, based on the heating degree days, it was the second coldest December in about 19 years and our customers in December used 13% more natural gas than they did in December of 2007. So, Allen is actually right. Basically, our earnings were hurt by the cool summer, but it got cold in a hurry, but never warmed up, but it got cold in a hurry and really we had very, very strong consumer demand for natural gas in the fourth quarter and in particularly in December.", "Allen Leverett ", "And in terms of fuel recovery Ted, I think you also were asking that question. For the year as a whole, at least as viewed by the shareholders were neutral on fuel recovery, and then we made a filing with the commission actually to refund approximately $8.5 million to customers associated with fuel recovery in 2008. So, shareholder fully recovered and I would say that customers will receive somewhere in the order of $8.5 million in refunds.", "Gale Klappa ", "And that would be a one-time bill credit we would expect for the commission would act pretty quickly, probably have a one-time bill credits to customers in the range Allen talked about in February or early March.", "Ted Hine - Catapult", "And then just one last question on the fuel recovery. What was the actual under recovery, when we\u2019re looking at the first quarter trying to do our earnings estimates for that? What was the actual under recovery in the first quarter of last year?", "Allen Leverett", "It\u2019s about $15 million under recovered in the first quarter of \u201808.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hi, guys really two questions a little bit separate from each other. First of all, Allen when we think about major construction projects post Power the Future, I mean if you\u2019ve got the South Oak Creek environmental retrofits and you have got the second winds plant construction? Can you talk a little bit about how much of the materials, the labor, the ENC contract. How much of that\u2019s locked down versus how much is kind of open price change?", "Gale Klappa", "First of all on Oak Creek, what we call ourselves Oak Creek air quality control project. The commission is already approved that is under construction, engineering is almost complete and we have locked down virtually all of the costs. All the major equipment has been procured and as Rick is pointing out, the steel is also locked down in terms of the price and procurement.", "So, not much variability that we would expect other than we need to get appropriate labor productivity, but we are pretty well fixed in terms of the procurement and the costs related to the air quality controls at Oak Creek. Now on the other hand, Michael the Glacier Hills Wind project is in the earliest stages of review by the commission. So, we have not locked in any pricing as of yet.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, so if the cost of wind turbines just kind of moving your way a little bit you\u2019ll be able to be capture. Your customers will capture the benefit of the lower facility; it might have a slight impact on your forward rate base there.", "Gale Klappa", "That is absolutely correct.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "The potential size of this wind farm, you could see that the investment cost of that wind farm being easily $500 million.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Right, understood, I mean what\u2019s the in-service date needed?", "Gale Klappa", "We would want to bring Glacier Hills Wind during 2012.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "All 500 megawatts?", "Gale Klappa", "Preferably, actually at the end of 2011, so we\u2019d have a full-year of service in 2012.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m sorry, I missed that. So, if it\u2019s 500 megawatts breaking ground late this year?", "Gale Klappa", "200 at the upper end about 200 megawatts and projecting around the cost of the fact size wind farm roughly $0.5 billion and then we would assuming the commission gives that go ahead in the timely fashion. We would strive to bring it in right of end of 2011, for our full-year of service in 2012.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Right because that gets you though to the, what is that I think the 8% required renewable portfolio outstanding?", "Gale Klappa ", "Michael it doesn\u2019t. It would get us with the other things we have in mind about 65% of the way there. We are also going to propose not in the next few months, but as we move forward and as actually as the renewable portfolio standard become clear, we\u2019re going to propose adding some modest amount of slower and perhaps a 50 megawatts biomass land and then we\u2019ll look and see where we are, but Glacier Hills does not get us to where we need to be by 2015. I think what we have on the table we can see how they get 65% of the way there.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it, last item just on the pension contribution, Allen, can you state what the pension contribution was you made January and more importantly what you expect to make over the next one or two years?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, the total contribution Michael was $290 million, $270 million of that, $290 million was for the pension trusts to fund the qualified pension benefits and then the remaining $20 million was for other post employment benefits, not related to pension, so things like retiree medical. Sitting here today, I can\u2019t predict, today Michael what market returns if any will look like in 2009, but at this point, I wouldn\u2019t expect to be making contributions in 2010 or \u201811. So, we will see what market returns are like this year.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Michael, I was looking forward to the Hard Rock in Vegas, but I think its going to be conference room in New York.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You know third year in a row for the conference room in New York. I think I\u2019ll tell you when I meet you for golf in Vegas one day.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Reza Hatefi \u2013 [Unidentified Company].", "Reza Hatefi - Unidentified Company.", "Allen, you were mentioning some of the economic issues being offset by O&M cuts, could you quantify O&M increase or decrease year-over-year from 2008 to \u201809?", "Allen Leverett", "I would expect in terms of overall O&M. So, just take regulatory amortization, so the side rates you just look at what I would view as controllable O&M in the business. We see that being essentially flat. In fact, it might actually be down slightly in 2009 as compared to 2008. So, when I talked about the net $0.15 per share negative impact, I\u2019m already netting out of that, originally what we might have expected to be some O&M increases, which now we\u2019re not going to see those increases.", "Gale Klappa", "Reza two things, we have done which we haven\u2019t discussed on the call, but we\u2019ve talked about elsewhere. We have frozen officer salaries for 2009 and we have also put in place of limited hiring policy. We will not be replacing any non-critical positions and not hiring additional people other than what are needed for the Power the Future investments.", "We obviously need to train operations people and maintenance folks for the new Power the Future assets that are coming online. So, clearly we will be hiring in that area, but only operations critical positions will be replaced. So, pretty much a limited hiring freeze and the freeze in officer salaries in a lot of other of very intelligent cost reductions that we don\u2019t believe will affect operational performance, but we\u2019re taking a very hard look as are all companies and what we absolutely must spend in \u201809.", "Reza Hatefi - Unidentified Company", "Okay and pension I\u2019m sorry, I missed that number. What is it, how much higher is it in \u201809 versus 2008?", "Gale Klappa", "That the FAS 87 expense is actually above level, I would expect at about $22 million. So, the $22 million away and I would say about $22 million in 2009, again that the FAS 87 expense.", "Reza Hatefi - Unidentified Company", "Okay, is the expected online time of the Oak Creek plant still the same as your previous guidance?", "Rick Kuester", "At the moment, Bechtel is still focusing and targeting on year-end 2009 for Unit 1 at the end of August 2010 for Unit 2. We will know, they\u2019re making good progress, we will know a lot more is in terms of a specific in service dates. As we come out of this spring and get into early summer. ", "There are number of milestones that they are targeting to meet and we\u2019ll have a much better feel probably by the end of June, but real likelihood of making me undergone \u201809, but I will say this in fact Rick and I, we\u2019re talking about this just a few minutes ago and that progress has been made nowhere, the book-ends are reasonably clear as to when we could expect the units to come online, but so far, that is Bechtel\u2019s continuing target, they are working toward it.", "Reza Hatefi - Unidentified Company", "Okay Allen, you\u2019ve mentioned I think $0.39 guidance for Power the Future for 2009. How much that is associated with the $0.39?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, that\u2019s an after-tax consolidated contribution Reza, from the four factors that I\u2019ve mentioned our full-year earnings from Port Washington one, full-year from Port two, as well as the earnings on the water handling system and the coal handling system. So, that all after tax consolidated basis after bottom line.", "Reza Hatefi - Unidentified Company", "At the top your head, I know you have the optionality of issuing debt as per the debt ratio and agreement, but then you could also issue some back leverage so to speak that. I\u2019m just wondering within that $0.39 calculation what the total debt is?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, I think the reasonable working assumption is that you look our consolidated capital structure, which at this point at least there is roughly 45% equity if you treat half of the hybrids as equity and half as debt, 45% equity, 75% debt on a consolidated basis. So, to your report Reza, the differential in the debt between the subsidiaries in holding company. In fact that back leverage brings 45, 55 capital structure and so when I quote $0.39 of share its levered on that basis 55% debt.", "Reza Hatefi - Unidentified Company", "Do you recall what the power of future earnings were in \u201807 and \u201808.", "Allen Leverett", "2007 we only had one of the units at Port Washington, so each unit is on the order of $0.14 a share, so we probably have on the order of $0.14 share, Reza in 2007 and 2008 we would have half of years earnings from Port two, so add $0.07 or 14 gives you 21 and I believe we had about the 21 think about a nickel probably from the coal handling system so total with the $0.26 or 26, 27 somewhere in that range for 2008 and $0.11 to issue to 39 in the 2009", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc. Please state your question ", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "Q4 guidance $0.72. I just wondering what the big drivers are that allowed $0.13.", "Allen Leverett", "We mention one thing we didn\u2019t give fourth quarter guidance per se although we certainly back into we gave guidance for the year at 290 and one way to look at it essentially they were three positives that helped overcome the impact of the economy and lower electric sales and the positives are pretty simply one weather two weather three weather, no I am kidding. But, weather was a big factor as I mentioned earlier consumer demand for natural gas in December was off the charts.", "We have 13% increase in natural gas send out in December compared to December of year ago so weather was a big driver obviously we have the earnings that Allen mentioned in the Q4 of \u201808 from the operation of second unit at Port Washington that was in Q4\u201907. We had good fuel recoveries in good control and those things together offset to decline in Energy sales particularly to our large commercial and industrial customers.", "Yes, Paul the guidance that we gave early December with our press release when we reaffirmed the 290 that was based on I didn\u2019t get have November results and as actually turned out; we had a pickup also in November from weather. So, just to reiterate what Gale is saying not only December weather, but we got a help from November weather better performance on O&M and then fuel also broke our way relative to the forecast that I had when we reaffirmed the guidance for the year early in December.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "What happened to fuel in the fourth quarter?", "Rick Kuester", "Well, in terms of fuel in the fourth quarter the figure that I have, we were essentially neutral. If we take cumulative for the three quarters Q1, Q2 and Q3 together for 2008, we were essentially in a neutral position going into the fourth quarter and we at least from the shareholders standpoint, remained in a neutral position and in fact built up that roughly $8.5 million over the recover balance, which we expect to return to customers as Gale mentioned earlier in the hopefully on February.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "But, you didn\u2019t book that?", "Rick Kuester", "No, we didn\u2019t book that, but again I took your question to be ones the differential between where you finally came in on the fourth quarter versus your financial plan or your forecast that you based your guidance on at December and honestly, when I did my guidance in December, I was still thinking that there was a chance that we could end up with under recovery.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "You still thinking 0-20 under recovery then?", "Rick Kuester", "No, I would say, going into the fourth quarter it could have been a couple million dollars under recovery. I certainly wouldn\u2019t have expected a big one, but we didn\u2019t see that and in fact we were neutral from a shareholders standpoint, if I understand your question.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "And for Q\u201907 you were under recovery, correct?", "Rick Kuester", "Let say, let me go back herein the forecast that were my recollection and my under recovery that I can see in \u201807 is about $36 million under recovery in the fourth quarter of \u201807.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "Kind of you gave an earnings walk, but you got us to 305, but you reiterating 305 to 315 where do we see the upside opportunities?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, the reason that I would step and I\u2019m sticking at the 305 to 315, if you look at the differential between the 290 and the 303, while as we discussed that\u2019s driven big factor is weather. So, at this point at least although January was cold, there are a lot of months to go in the year, so I wouldn\u2019t want to step out there and say that weather for the year is going to be net adder versus the financial plan.", "Gale Klappa", "Although, a lot of moving parts and we\u2019re working on all of them. So, we feel we can get some more in the and as Allen said, we have a pretty good feel for how to get to the 305 and we are working on the moving parts to see what we can do beyond that.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, and on sales, as Gale mentioned in the script. Sitting here today, we don\u2019t see a need to change the sales forecast outlook that we put out there in December, but being very candid results were kind of mixed in January. So, we are not changing our sales forecast, but the results were somewhat mixed in January. So, I think that\u2019s still might potentially be a downside force we will see.", " ", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Was there pending fuel legislation in Wisconsin, has that been resolved? ", "Gale Klappa ", "No, that has not yet been resolved. The Wisconsin Commission basically came to a conclusion that it changed in how the fuel recovery mechanism works in Wisconsin that any change in that mechanism would require legislative approval, and our latest understanding is that the commission and the governor will propose a legislative change sometime during 2009. Given the time it takes to get a bill through the legislature my guess is we will not see any change in the fuel rules for 2009. If there were to be change passed from the legislature probably would take effect to 2010.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Whatever they do I\u2019m sure they are going to make it harder for us to figure out what\u2019s going on into fuel because investors.", "Gale Klappa ", "Well, wait the whole idea if there is a change would be make it more transparent and easier to administer.

I think our, typical industrial customer probably saw in January about 1.3% to 1.5% rate increase, but to make a long story short and we will get you the numbers, the bill credits would step down in \u201809, step down again its 2010 there maybe some modest amount left in 2011 we will have to see.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, if you look at retail. So, we are talking about Wisconsin and Michigan retail, It provided approximately $316 million in credits in 2008 and then in 2009, my expectation would be to provide roughly $240 million worth of credits.

We would expect Wisconsin credits unless the commission decides to do it differently, we would expect Wisconsin credits to run through 2010 and 2011.

Basically, the rate stays in affect with one exception and that is we had a special agreement with our commission last year that if we over recovered last year we would refund and that\u2019s what Allen has mentioned about an $8.5 million refund that we filed to be able to provide the customers and hope to do so, with very shortly here.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "Okay and then moving on to the sales work forecast. I take it you guys are in conversation with some of your large industrial customers, and given the trend you saw in the fourth quarter versus what you\u2019ve guided to in terms of I think like 6% or so, decline in 2009. I guess it certainly implies some improvement or stabilization in the outlook during the year in 2009. Is that the case that\u2019s what your customers are telling that you were kind of in the worst part of the decline right now and they expect to be using more power in the third or fourth quarter?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, based upon the interviews and just to be more specific, we have done interviews. I would say fairly structured interviews with roughly our top 100 customers and listening to what they\u2019re saying, obviously they all have their own view and they\u2019re in different sectors, but we would indicate that we would start to see a turnaround in electric sales into the third quarter of 2009, but of course, who knows if they are right or not, but if you look at what they\u2019re telling us that certainly would imply.", "And Steve, what were doing right now, I\u2019m getting weekly reports, since we have pretty much automated meters on all large customers. We can poll that the meters on a weekly basis at least and it\u2019s a blunt instrument, but try to at lest to get a snapshot of what\u2019s going on with key customers.", "So, that\u2019s not to say that won\u2019t get surprise, I mean we still may get surprised, but we are trying to get as much real time data we can to ascertain what\u2019s going on and that\u2019s certainly something that we will keep you all apprised of on our earnings calls, and one other Steve just to clarify what Gale was saying on the fuel, obviously we are filing a general rate case as he said and within the context of that general rate case, you will also file fuel information and you are filing all those work papers in the first half of this year, included with those work papers will be a forecast o fuel.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "Great, so I guess on that point Allen from if we continue to have kind of a week gas and power price outlook that it seems like your O&M is relatively stable, you are not really increasing the CapEx, that much versus the current run rate. So, the real moving pieces are fuel and these bill credits and so, it seems like if we get a nice tail and from fuel it could actually result in a headline amount that shouldn\u2019t be that bad for customers? Is that a fair way to think about it?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes, I think that\u2019s a very fair way to think about it and one other point that Allen was alluding to, I really think the visibility that our customers have about there future markets and future orders is very limited right now. It\u2019s interesting to see and we\u2019ve practiced Allen said a lot of our large customers, I have looked at four or five virtually every other day and in one instance, one of our largest customers who gave us their input and what they\u2019ve thought their usage and production would be in late November ramped 12% above what they thought they were going to do in January.", "In another instance, another large Wisconsin customer was dead on, but is now saying they\u2019re not sure about February. So, I think that the visibility Steve is, just not great given where the economy is in the uncertainty, but I think the good news is, that the mixed results some better, some worse, but it came out in terms of what we were seeing for January for our largest customers on a composite basis about exactly where we thought it would.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "Finally, when will you file for the rate case?", "Gale Klappa", "Sometime in the first half of this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "", "I wanted to just ask a question on the recovery of fuel. You\u2019ve mentioned that in 2008, you agreed to give all over recovery back to customers. Is that the case in 2009 and if we have $4.50 gas will there potentially to be sent to shareholders? Or how does that work?", "Gale Klappa", "We had a special stipulation as you mentioned with the consumer groups and with the consumer groups and with the commission for 2008. The normal fuel rules will apply for 2009 and as I mentioned earlier, the normal fuel rules work off a bandwidth plus or minus your projected fuel recovery amount. So, depending upon how the fuel markets work and what our actual fuel costs are and actually it also what our actual MISO costs are in terms of purchase power. We will operate within that 2% bandwidth for 2009.", "Nathan judge - Atlantic equities", "Just as far as going back to your EPC contract to Bechtel and the negotiations going on there. Could you just give us an update on timing as you see at currently, I think you\u2019ve mentioned some comments on the call, but could you be a bit more specific and give us more color on that, that will be appreciated, thank you.", "Gale Klappa ", "We\u2019ve covered in the early remarks, obviously the fact that Bechtel filed basically two major claims in late December and there is a very specific process laid out in the contract to resolve any disputes and essentially, if mediation and management discussions don\u2019t work, then the contract calls to move to binding arbitration.", "We\u2019re in the discussion mediation stage right now; I expect that will take a fair amount of time, just because of the modest data involved in the amount of data interchanged that\u2019s needed and if that doesn\u2019t work and we go to binding arbitration. I think we have estimated that the whole process to take 12 to 18 months. I\u2019m looking at our correct legal council on each degree. That\u2019s his best shot 12 to 18 months if we go to binding arbitration.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "First, I just wanted to verify, I think you said there is you have no plans to issue any debt in \u201809 is that right?", "Gale Klappa ", "Dan I have no plans to issue any long-term debt. Obviously, we\u2019ll continue to be an issuer of commercial paper and we\u2019ll look at market conditions, if market conditions are good for utility long-term debt, say in the latter part of the year, say in late third, end of the fourth quarter, we may consider doing something with Wisconsin electric power company, but that the point that I was trying to make with my comments, we don\u2019t have to do that. We\u2019ve got some flexibility with the right conditions during this year. If we don\u2019t like the conditions, we can wait until 2010.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "Okay, on the Bechtel claims, I think you said it was $413 million, is that right?", "Allen Leverett ", "Well, they\u2019re essentially two large claims. The first one is 413 and second one is for 72 if my memory serves me right.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "Okay, so the combined it\u2019s like 485 then.", "Allen Leverett ", "Yes, now that is on a total project basis and of course we have two co-owners that own roughly 15% of the facility. So, to judge any impact on Wisconsin Energy you basically take 485 and subtract 15%.", "Allen Leverett ", "Which works out to be about $412 million.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "How much is related to the labor market charges that you\u2019ve mentioned I think you said you\u2019re currently disputing that part?", "Gale Klappa", "Bechtel has not really broken out. Frankly, we have asked repeatedly for a detailed explanation of their belief of the cost they\u2019ve incurred because of weather they could not have reasonably expected, but they have not in their claim broken out weather versus labor. So, I cannot give you a straight answer or a definitive answer on how much is labor and how is weather. We would like to have that information and we\u2019re pressing for that as well.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Okay, so they have an itemized kind of different areas of dispute?", "Gale Klappa", "We think that\u2019s something we definitely want to see.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "Okay and then if I could just get a little more color on some of your large customers in the economy? Have you had any that have actually shutdown, I know in Janesville they had a big auto plant, I know that\u2019s not in your service territory, but if you had any big customers that have actually shutdown that, probably wouldn\u2019t comeback when the economy comes back?", "Gale Klappa", "The only one that really comes to mind and this was announced actually about 18 months ago. There is a major Delphi auto parts operation near Oak Creek that announced when Delphi, went into bankruptcy sometime in the past 18 months that they would be as part of the reorganization closing the Delphi plant, but that has really been closed to ideal now for six months to eight months.", "Beyond that, we\u2019ve seen production cutbacks virtually across the board and as I mentioned most dramatically with primary metal companies like foundries and specialty steal operations, automotive and automotive products and paper, but beyond that and of course the loss of two large paper mills for the second half of last year that permanently closed. The Niagara and the Kimberly mills that were formally owned by Stora Enso in Eastern and Northern Wisconsin, those two mills have closed, but Delphi and those two mills is about yet, everything else is just kind of reduced production levels.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin", "I was wondering on your O&M, it was up quite a bit both in the fourth quarter and year-to-date the other O&M. Is that related to maybe some reclassification due to Point Beach or is there other things going on there or what?", "Gale Klappa", "Allen will explain because there is a lot of moving parts because of the commission order and the recovery of regulatory assets and the amortization of the game. So, you really have to work your way through the pieces to get a clear picture.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes. In the right case Dan and when I say the rate case this would have been the case we filed in \u201807, new rates that we are in effect of beginning of \u201808 and we had increases in the [ATC Terra], PTF leads costs and then amortization and recovery of other deferred costs. If you take all those three together and that was about $263 million, which you would see in the O&M account.", "The other impact if you are looking at \u201808 versus \u201807 we had in effect a one-time recovery if you will of bad debt cost, which were $44 million in the first quarter of \u201808, that also runs through the O&M account. So, if you look at transmission PTF recovery of deferred costs essentially that was $307 million. Then we had increase in O&M it\u2019s a power plants and delivery area that was $62 million so all that\u2019s together $369 million. Then we have the nuclear units that come out. So, that\u2019s $120 million in the other way and that gets you roughly $250 million increase in O&M. Steve, you had one other factor. ", "Steve Dickson ", "Yeah Dan your question I thought also focused on the fourth quarter and if you remember last year, we sold the Point Beach plant in the fourth quarter. So, on an annual basis if you\u2019re comparing O&M, as Allen said, we have these large increases for the regulatory items, but offsetting that was reduction in an O&M to the Point Beach. That lasted through the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter it\u2019s comparable on Point Beach wouldn\u2019t have that positive benefit as compared to the first three quarters. So, that\u2019s one of the key factors on why the fourth quarter O&M looks even higher.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Maurice May - Power Insights. ", "Maurice May - Power Insights", "Yes, actually Paul Ridzon asked both of my questions exactly and so thank you Paul", "Gale Klappa ", "That\u2019s concludes our conference call for today. Ladies and gentlemen, we appreciate you talking part. If you have any other questions Colleen Henderson is available in the Investor Relations office, her direct line 414-221-2592.

(Operator Instructions).", "Before the conference call begins I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation other than historical facts, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information on its 2009 first quarter results at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on our conference call to review the company's 2009 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of. Regeneration; Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; and Steve Dickson, Controller.", "Allen will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $1.20 a share for the first quarter of 2009. This compares with $1.04 a share from the same period in 2008. Our stronger earnings this quarter were largely driven by a reduction in our cost of fuel and purchase power.", "On April 27, we filed with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to reduce retail prices for our electric customers in Wisconsin, in light of the significant drop we've seen in the cost of fuel, particularly natural gas and diesel. Based on actual fuel costs to date, and projected data for the remainder of this year, we expect that our annual fuel costs for 2009 would be about $67 million less than what we had been collecting in customer rates.", "Now, I would like to touch briefly on the impact of the ongoing recession across our service area. Generally our region has a well diversified industrial and commercial base which helps to mitigate the impact of most economic downturns. However, in this economy we're seeing three sectors that have been dramatically affected. They are ore mining, primary metals and paper production.", "Led by declines in this three sectors our electricity sales to large commercial and industrial customers dropped by 17.8% in the first quarter, as compared to first quarter of 2008. Electricity used by small commercial and industrial customers declined by 2.3%. Consumption of electricity by residential customers was down 3.5%, driven primarily by milder winter weather.", "Now, over the past few weeks, we have seen anecdotal evidence that industrial production and economic output in our region maybe stabilizing. Stabilizing at levels that are clearly below what we expected as we entered 2009. There are, however, some bright spots. Our largest customer, the iron ore mines in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan had been planning to close their mines for the entire month of July. They've now announced they will operate through July, and they plan to add 600,000 tons of production in their forecast for 2009.", "In the heavy machinery sector for mining equipment, major producers actually increased their electricity consumption in the first quarter of this year by an average of 5%. In the healthcare industry across southeastern Wisconsin, we're continuing to see positive growth of electricity use in the first quarter of 4% over the comparable period last year, and several major hospital and health service expansions remain on track.", "And finally, energy used in the gaming and entertainment sector was up 4% for the quarter, reflecting a major casino expansion that was completed late last year.", "Now, I would like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our power of the future plan is fundamental with the principle of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle gas fired units at Port Washington, north of Milwaukee, construction of two supper-critical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of city and building a significant amount of renewable generation.", "As we've discussed on previous calls, both units at Port Washington are in service, construction was completed on time and on budget. The units are among the most efficient in the Midwest market, they are operating well and our customers are now benefiting from the low price of natural gas that fuel these units.", "Let's turn now to the status of the two new coal-fired units at Oak Creek. Based on Bechtel's revised schedule, Unit 1 and the common facilities are approximately 92% complete, and Unit 2 is approximately 45% complete. Progress on Unit 1 is shifting rapidly from construction to commissioning. Many of the electrical systems, load centers and controls have been handed over to start up, while construction crews continue to finish up the large mechanical systems, such as the boiler and the turbine generator.", "Completing the duct work, needed to convey the air and exhaust gases through the boiler and through the air quality controls to the chimney stack is now a critical activity at the site. This work is nearing completion as the access points are being closed in preparation for firing the boiler on natural gas. The internal surfaces of the boiler tubes must be chemically cleaned before the boiler can be fired; of course, this cleaning process is scheduled to start later this month.", "During April, our contractor also completed the necessary hydrostatic pressure tests on the feed water system. This system will supply high pressure, high temperature water to the boiler.", "Regarding the Hitachi Supply Turbine Generator, Bechtel completed the lubricating oil flush last month. This ensures that the system, which supplies oil to the main turbine generator bearings are free of contamination from construction. And I'm pleaded to report that the turbine generator was placed on turning gear for the first time last night.", "As I mentioned in our last call, the cooling water intake system was placed in the commercial service on January 18. This means we are drawing water through the tunnel and supplying it to the four existing units at the Oak Creek site. Of course, the tunnel will also supply cooling water to the new units when they become operational. I should add that the first of six circulating water pumps for the new units is scheduled to run for the first time next week.", "Bechtel is continuing to target commercial operation of Unit 1 by the end of this year, and Unit 2 by the end of August, 2010. Over the past few months, Bechtel has made significant progress at the site, including making up the time that it had previously lost in piping installation. Bechtel is behind its plan for turning over individual systems from construction start up. Bechtel has delivered a recovery plan and is adding resources in an effort to recover the schedule.", "We will have a better feel for the likely completion date for Unit 1, once first fire is achieved and that first fire milestone is currently scheduled to take place in mid-August.", "Now, as you know, Bechtel filed a formal claim last December seeking relief under the contract. Bechtel is citing a number of factors, including weather conditions in the winters of '06-'07, and '07-'08. Heavy rains in the spring of '08 and what Bechtel believes to be changes in local labor conditions. Claims for schedule and cost relief related to these factors totaled $413 million. Bechtel also stated its belief that the weather events constitute a force majeure.", "We don't believe there is a contractual basis for some of the claims that Bechtel submitted. For example, we disagree that Bechtel is entitled to cost or schedule relief as a result of alleged changes in the labor market. Bechtel also filed a $72 million claim, the alleged effects of changes and delays prior to the issuance of the full notice to proceed back in 2005. We believe this claim is without merit, and that Bechtel was fully compensated for any and all impacts of the delayed start.", "Finally, Bechtel has asked for six months of relief from liquidated damages beyond the September 29, 2009 guaranteed date for Unit 1, and three months of relief from liquidated damages beyond the September 29, 2010 guaranteed date for Unit 2. We are reviewing the claims, of course, and we've asked Bechtel for additional information. We expect the claims will be resolved through the contract's formal dispute resolution process.", "A step of that process called for management meetings to see if we could reach a resolution. This step has been completed and we were unable to resolve our differences with Bechtel. Currently, we are in the nonbinding mediation stage of the process. If this step is not completed successfully, then we are likely to begin binding arbitration by early fall. Binding arbitration could certainly carried on until mid-year 2010.", "As we assess these developments, I believe there are several key points to keep in mind. First, we are still recovering carrying costs associated with the construction of these units. Under the terms of the lease agreements between Wisconsin Electric and W.E. Power, we are recovering based on a mix of debt and equity, our capital carrying costs as construction continues on the Oak Creek Project. We're allowed to recover our carrying costs up to the total budget for the project that's been approved by Wisconsin Commission. So we believe our ability to recover cash carrying costs should be largely unaffected by a slight change in the construction schedule.", "I would also like to repeat an important point about the ultimate recovery of any potential cost increases. We believe we have several layers of protection for recovery of our costs. So for example, to conclude that an additional cost is not ultimately recoverable, you would have to believe that the costs will not qualify for recovery under at least four opportunities.", "First, the remaining contingency in the project is not sufficient to offset the cost. Second, that the cost would fall outside the 5% band that the commission has deemed reasonable for prudent costs above the approved amount for the project. Third, that the cost was not caused buy a force majeure event as defined by the lease agreements. And finally, after an opportunity to demonstrate prudency that the cost would be ultimately deemed to be imprudent.", "One more important point; liquidated damage payments will be due from Bechtel on Unit 1, unless it is determined that any days granted for scheduled release are equal to or exceed the delay of the schedule. Of course, as we move forward we'll provide you with updates on any major developments through our SEC filings and on our scheduled earnings calls.", "Now turning to renewables; the State of Wisconsin has a renewable portfolio standard that increase from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each of the utilities using an historical baseline. So using that baseline, approximately 8.5% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.", "Meeting the aggressive 2015 targets could require a mixture of additional projects and short-term purchase power agreements. Of course, with the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm last year, we took a significant step toward meeting Wisconsin's goal to reduce its carbon footprint. With a total of '88 turbines, each with a capacity of 1.65 megawatts, Blue Sky Green Field is the largest wind farm to date in Wisconsin. It was completed under-budget and ahead of schedule.", "To continue on the path of carbon reduction, we acquired FPL Energy a wind site in Colombia County in East Central Wisconsin. In October of last year, we filed for approval to build our new wind project, which is called the Glacier Hills Wind Park. The Public Service Commission deemed our application to be completed on January 27, so the Commission's 180 day review period is now underway. The site can accommodate between 130 and 207 megawatts of new capacity, depending on the final layout and the turbine equipment that we select. The first full year of operation under our plan is expected to be 2012.", "Construction, as you may know, is also underway on a major upgrade of the air quality controls of the existing coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We expect the cost of this facility will be about $960 million. That includes allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of wet flue gas de-sulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities. We expect these controls to be completed in 2012.", "In other recent developments, on March 13, we filed a general rate case on our normal cycle for our Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas utilities. Filing includes a request for a $76.5 million or 2.8% increase to support electric operations. A $38.9 million or 4.6% increase for Wisconsin Gas operations. A $22.1 million offer 3.6% increase for Wisconsin Electric and Gas operations, and $2.7 million for our two steam utilities.", "On evaluating our electric operations, we concluded that a 6.1% increase could clearly be justified, but we are limiting the electric request to take into account the difficult conditions our customers face in today's economy. We plan to make up for the difference by continuing to manage company budgets and proposing to recover certain costs over a slightly longer period of time.", "The increase in electric rates that we've requested will continue to support investment in our power of the future plan, upgrades to the transmission grid by the American Transmission Company, employee benefit costs, and very slightly higher (inaudible). The Wisconsin Commission will hold hearings on our request in the fall and we expect new rates to be effective in January of 2010.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to Allen, who will give you more details on you financial performance for the first quarter.", "Allen Leverett", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, our first quarter 2009 earnings from continuing operations were $1.20 per share. I'll focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows for the quarter and discuss our earnings guidance for 2009.", "You may want to refer to page six of the earnings package as I make my remarks. Our consolidated operating income was $243 million as compared to $218 million in the first quarter of 2008 or an increase of $25 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $260 million or an increase of $10 million versus last year.", "The largest single factor impacting our utility operating income related to favorable recoveries of fuel. In the first quarter of 2009, we experienced $28 million in favorable fuel recoveries, as compared to the first quarter of 2008, where we realized $14 million in unfavorable fuel recoveries. On a quarter-to-quarter comparison, this led to a $42 million favorable impact on operating income.", "In addition to the fuel recoveries, our first quarter 2009 benefited from $28 million of other pricing increases, largely related to the January, 2008, Wisconsin Retail Rate Order, net of bill credits. On the negative side, the decline in retail electric sales resulted in a $20 million reduction in operating income. We experienced $15 million in increased amortization related costs and we recorded a $10 million reduction in revenues, because of the PSCW mandated refund.", "Our depreciation expense increased $5 million on a quarter-to-quarter basis, due in large part to the wind additions in May, 2008. While 2009 has been slightly colder than normal, we estimate that weather had a negative $5 million impact, as compared to 2008, because the prior year experienced an extremely cold first quarter. Other items had a net negative $5 million impact.", "I will expand on our discussion on fuel recoveries and electric sales later in this presentation as I look at the full year. However, I did want to mention at this point that the $10 million refund mandated by the PSCW is not expected to have a net impact on our earnings this year. We anticipate that this refund will be offset by approximately $10 million in fuel credits that are expected from MISO over the rest of the year.", "Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which primarily includes W.E. Power, was up $14 million. The key drivers of this increase related to a full quarter's earnings contribution from Unit 2 at Port Washington, which was placed into service in May, 2008. Our earnings also benefited from the water intake system at Oak Creek that was placed into service in January of this year.", "Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $1 million in 2009, compared to an operating loss of $2 million in 2008. This improvement reflected the shutdown of our Minergy operation at the end of last year. Taking the changes for each of these segments together brings you back to the $25 million increase in operating income for 2009.", "During the first quarter of 2009, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased $3 million. Other income declined $3 million, primarily because of lower property sales. Interest expense increased $2 million, because of the interest expense associated with Unit 2 at Port Washington, and additional long-term debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $4 million, because of higher pre-tax earnings, offset in part by a lower effective income tax rate. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 36.5%, compared to 38.6% last year. I expect that our annual effective tax rate in 2009 will be approximately 37%. Combining all of these items, brings you to $142 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2009 or earnings of $1.20 per share.", "During the first quarter of 2009, we generated $20 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is down $324 million from the same period in 2008. While our cash earnings were up, there were two large factors that reduced our cash from operations. First, we contributed $289 million to our benefit plans in January of 2009, of which $270 million went to fund our pension plan.", "In the first quarter of 2008, our contributions to benefit plans totaled $48 million. The second factor which reduced cash from operations related to a reduction in our accounts payable, primarily as a result of falling natural gas prices. This was partially offset by lower receivable balances. On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $78 million, as compared to $432 million in the first quarter of 2008. The adjusted number includes $58 million of cash impact from the bill credits in 2009, and $88 million in 2008.", "Under GAAP, the cash from the bill credits is reflected in the change and restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From a management standpoint, we consider this, the source of cash as it directly relates to the bill credits. Our total capital expenditures were approximately $171 million in the first quarter of 2009, which is down from the $348 million in the first quarter of 2008.", "On an annual basis, we expect our capital expenditures to be about $300 million lower than 2008 capital expenditures, as we move closer to the completion of our Power the Future construction program. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 58.5% as of March 31, and we were at 55.5% on an adjusted basis. This is essentially flat compared to our December 31, 2008 levels even when considering the $289 million contribution to our benefit plans in January of this year.", "I would expect our debt to capital ratio to increase slightly by the end of this year as compared to last year. Our goal remains to maintain our adjusted debt to capital ratio at no more than 60% during the period we are constructing our new coal-fired generation. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "Now, I would like to wrap things up for the discussion of earnings guidance for 2009, as well as the second quarter. Our earnings guidance for 2009 remains in the range of $3.05 to $3.15 per share, as we discussed in our last call. We expect the total earnings contribution of $0.39 per share from our Power the Future program in 2009. This includes a full calendar year contribution from the two units at Port Washington, as well as the water and coal handling systems at Oak Creek.", "In 2011, when we expect both of the new Oak Creek units to be online for a full year, assuming a favorable resolution of the Bechtel claim, we project an additional $0.75 per share of earnings from our Power the Future program. Although our bottom-line guidance for 2009 is unchanged, I did want to discuss our latest outlook for electric fuel cost recovery, as well as electric sales.", "Previously, we expected to be in a fully recovered position on fuel costs in 2009. As it turns out, prices for natural gas and diesel fuel have dropped more than we expected, and we were in a $28 million favorable recovery position as of March 31 of this year.", "The drop in natural gas prices was a key reason for our filing with Public Service Commission of Wisconsin last week to reduce the fuel recovery rate for our retail electric customers in Wisconsin. However, since the new fuel rate can only be implemented on a perspective basis, we now estimate that the company will be in a positive recovery position of approximately $20 million for calendar year 2009.", "Now, although this is a positive development, we now expect that the downturn in the economy will have a more negative impact on our electricity sales than we previously expected. Our sales of electricity to large commercial and industrial customers were down almost 18% in the first quarter. On a comparable basis, the sales outlook that we provided last December assumed a 15% reduction in electric sales for the first quarter.", "The previous electric sales outlook [called] for an annual 6% reduction in electricity sales to large commercial and industrial customers in 2009. When we included projected sales to the Cleveland Cliffs mines in Michigan, the previous outlook was for a 9% decline. The previous forecast also reflected a 2.5% reduction for small commercial and industrial customers in 2009 and sales to residential customers being essentially flat.", "Taking into account what we are seeing across the economy, our new outlook for 2009 forecast an 11% reduction in electric sales to large commercial and industrial customers, excluding sales to Cleveland Cliffs, and a 15% reduction including those sales. Sales to small commercial and industrial customers are now expected to fall 6%, while residential sales are projected to decline 2% on a weather normalized basis.", "I currently expect the net impact of these further sales reductions to also be about $20 million on a pre-tax basis, as compared to our prior forecast. So we currently expect the fuel recovery and the net impact of the change in sales forecast to offset each other. And our 2009 guidance remains in the range of $3.05 to $3.15 per share. Our current forecast for earnings in the second quarter is $0.38 to $0.43 per share. This expectation reflects lower recovery to fuel as a result of the recent rate reduction and lower retail electric sales.", "With that I'll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Allen, thank you very much. Overall, we are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Paul Ridzon from KeyBanc, please state your question.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "One of the trends I think we have all been surprised by is the fact that industrial sales seemed to have less of an impact than people had feared, given that latter rates are set on monthly peak demand charges rather than absolute megawatt hours. Is that kind of how your rates are structured?", "Gale Klappa", "Paul, you are absolutely right. Particularly, with our large, commercial and industrial customers the demand component is a significant portion of their bill. And what we are seeing, anecdotally, with the pretty significant decline in kilowatt hour sales to major manufacturing firms. We are seeing them reduce weekend production. We are seeing them reduce second and third shift production. When they do run, they are running pretty much at full capacity. So you are absolutely right, in that. We haven't seen a significant margin erosion as one might expect if you just looked at an 18% decline in sales.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "I guess the biggest risk is that they actually shutdown and what do you see as far as that trend?", "Gale Klappa", "We stay in pretty good close touch with our customers at the moment and we did see this happen obviously late last week. We have one major additional shutdown and that's the engine plant that has been a long time Chrysler engine manufacturing plant near Kenosha. That's one of our 20 largest customers. Obviously, Chrysler went into bankruptcy. That plant will not operate, nor will any other Chrysler plant until Chrysler emerges from bankruptcy.", "And then the current thinking is that that plant will shutdown permanently at the end of 2010. Although, the state is making a major effort to try to extend the life of the plant, but the only major customer that I see at risk in terms of complete shutdown at the moment would be the one we saw announced last week and that's Chrysler.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "And what are the wholesale markets currently offering as far as margins relative to kind of the special rates that these large industrials get?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, really that's not a very big impact if any impact on our earnings, because if you think about where our earnings come from, probably 90% to 92% of our earnings are coming from our retail regulated operations. We have formulary tariffs for our wholesale power business. And so, the month-to-month or day-to-day gyrations in the wholesale market are not having a major impact on us. But I will say and I'm looking at Rick to see if he has any additional information.", "We have seen a major decline in the MISO prices across the first quarter. We have very, very efficient new natural gas units at Port Washington, they are among the most efficient in the country, and there were times, when our natural gas units were being dispatched into the MISO market ahead of our base load coal. So, really the world has kind of turned upside down with natural gas prices at $3. But in terms of just day-to-day impacts of the MISO market not a huge impact on earnings.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc", "Okay. Allen talked about a $10 million offsetting impact of MISO refund relative to the fuel refund to customers. What was that item?", "Gale Klappa", "It's called revenue sufficiency guarantee money. Essentially, its dollars that generators are paid to make sure that the system is well supported and functioning well, and, that proper reserves are in place in any given hour. And FERC ordered basically a recalculation of RSG payments to generators, compared to what MISO had been paying to generators. Those dollars, theoretically, are being collected by MISO from those who owe the money, which is largely power marketers and the dollars will flow to the generators we believe over the course of the remainder of 2009. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, originally, Paul, we had expected to just flow those dollars back to customers as we received them. What the Commission ordered us to do, instead of that is say, all right, look, you anticipate $10 million from the stream of revenues later in the year, go ahead and give back the $10 million now and then obviously the company will retain those $10 million later in the year to offset the $10 million that we are giving to customers this month.", "Gale Klappa", "So in essence there are two different fuel actions taking place. This month, there is a one-time refund to customers for fuel [over] recovery in 2008 and for this particular refund that we talked about the RSG revenues and then in addition to that the lower ongoing fuel recovery rate went into effect on May 1. Is that responsive and helpful?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes. So we should continue to see April benefit from lower fuel in the second quarter?", "Gale Klappa", "The answer is yes.", "Operator", "Leslie Rich from Columbia Management, please state your question.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Allen was zipping through those percentage declines in the different customer classes.", "Gale Klappa", "He zips pretty good.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Yeah, he is very zippy. And I want to make sure I understand your current expectations versus previous. I believe at the beginning of the year, you had forecasted 3% decline in total retail sales. Is that still your current thinking, or you are thinking it's going to be down 6%?", "Allen Leverett", "Our original forecast for the entire retail across all classes, Leslie, so residential, commercial and industrial, small as well as large, including the mines, the original forecast was for about 4% reduction overall. And what I would say today again on the same basis, about an 8% reduction.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Across all classes?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "Okay and then that translates into about $20 million pre-tax?", "Allen Leverett", "It roughly translates into about $40 million. My assumption is that we can offset about $20 million of that within the business and then the other $20 million is assumed to be offset with fuel.", "Gale Klappa", "That would be the first quarter fuel positive recovery.", "Operator", "Then [Cedilla Merky with CDP US], please state your question.", "Cedilla Merky - CDP US", "Couple of things, one, can you, given the changes in gas prices and everything like that, when the coal units go into operation, what are you currently kind of estimating are the fuel savings associated with displacing purchase power (inaudible) with natural gas?", "Gale Klappa", "I am we have the precise number in the room with us, but our 2.8% requested rate increase for 2010 reflects both the increased investment costs as the units come into service, but it also reflects the fact that our two new coal units will dispatch a very significant amount of time and lower our fuel costs. So, the net of the two is about a 2.8% increase.", "Cedilla Merky - CDP US", "Okay. And secondarily, what's the latest with regards to your carbon sequestration [pilot project] update?", "Gale Klappa", "Glad you asked that question. In fact, we'll be having our annual stockholders meeting day after tomorrow and we plan to update our stockholders on the progress of the test. It is certainly promising. We've had over 3,600 hours of operation of the technology. And late last fall for the first time, technology achieved the kind of results in the field that we have seen it achieved in the laboratory. In other words, it was capturing more than 90% of the carbon from the emission stream that was being captured.", "So very promising, we believe the testing now will extend several more months. All the partners of the project have agreed to continue the testing on into probably the end of 2009 at our Pleasant Prairie Plant. Then we are all comfortable enough with the results that we are seeing that a commitment has been made to scale up the technology by a factor of 10. Install that scaled up technology at American Electric Power's Mountaineer Plant in West Virginia. So that would be the next step.", "And by the way, and Rick's pointing it out, that particular plant in West Virginia that AEP owns has the geologic capability of sequestering the CO2. So that also would be the next step in commercialization of the technology, but overall pretty promising.", "Operator", "Justin Maurer with Lord Abbett, please state your question.", "Justin Maurer - Lord Abbett", "Good afternoon, guys. Couple of follow-ups to Paul's questions; first, on the industrial customers, just so that I understand the way the rates are structured. Again, you talked a little bit about that they are not working weekends or working more shifts, is there anything they can do to lower their costs, if you will, by scheduling differently? Or is it kind of a fixed cost to them to a certain extent anyway?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, some of our customers are on different versions of real-time pricing. So they can react to market prices. But the truth of the matter is many of our large industrial customers don't have with their running a lot of capability to shift. For example, one of our large customers melts steel and when they are operating that melter is operating full bore. So yes, there are little things that can be done around the edges. But what our customers are looking at, and you would expect this, is they are looking at what maximizes their total production costs.", "In other words, they are looking at labor, they are looking at overtime, so they are looking at the whole package of their costs and saying when should I run to minimize my cost and maximize my production? And right now what we are seeing them do, largely, is run weekdays during the day. So eight hour shifts during weekdays. And I wouldn't frankly expect unless the economy gets materially worse for that to change.", "Justin Maurer - Lord Abbett", "Okay. Is there a way to frame it up though, to say okay, of our average customer, to the extent there is such a thing that two-thirds of their cost is fixed, if you will, a third is variable or is it not that straightforward?", "Gale Klappa", "Justin, I wish it was that straightforward, but for each different customer, it really is different.", "Justin Maurer - Lord Abbett", "Everybody is trying to guesstimate kind of the direction of the economy as we move into the spring, that there was a huge shutdown in November- December or January-February, maybe a little bit late in March. Where do you get a sense, like you said you are very close contact with your customers, are they seeing not great, but reasonable sequential improvement as we get into April here, early May or is it still kind of choppy?", "Gale Klappa", "Justin, I don't think we are seeing any material sequential improvement. What I think we are seeing and we are now looking at data literally each day and each week. For the past four weeks, we have seen very good stabilization. If you look at our forecasts and you look at what's actually happening in the industrial sector, the last four weeks, we have been about dead on. As I mentioned earlier in our prepared remarks, I think we are seeing clear signs of stabilization, but at a lower level. So to put it to vernacular, I'm thinking and hoping that we are scraping along the bottom right now.", "Justin Maurer - Lord Abbett", "Then just so I am clear on the fuel recovery and the rebate, so the up front portion of that was already paid in the first quarter in March, correct? And then balance of that will unwind, if you will, as we go through the rest of the year?", "Allen Leverett", "There are two refunds, Justin. There is one refund that's roughly $8.6 million that was associated with 2008. So that was accrued for in 2008. The dollars were collected in 2008 and those dollars are being returned to customers this month. So there are $10 million. And that's the $10 million charge that we took in the first quarter of this year. So we go ahead and give that $10 million back in May, and then the company expects though to receive the $10 million throughout the remainder of the year.", "Justin Maurer - Lord Abbett", "Okay. So to Paul's question of the second quarter, those two amounts would net each other, although, I guess you took the charge in the first quarter so you're still benefit?", "Operator", "Once again, Andrew Levi with Incremental Capital, please state your question.", "Andrew Levi - Incremental Capital", "Did you give guidance for the second quarter, did I miss that?", "Gale Klappa", "Allen gave you a range of guidance. I think he can repeat it for you.", "Allen Leverett", "I'm sorry you missed it Andy, I can repeat it. It's $0.38 to $0.43 Andy for the quarter.", "Andrew Levi - Incremental Capital", "There you go, that's why the stock came in. And second question; then you mentioned about $0.75 of incremental earnings for 2010, is that what you said, too?", "Allen Leverett", "What I said was we have two coal units that we are building. And I would expect at this point at least that both of those units would be online for all of calendar year 2011. So, given that we would expect $0.75 of incremental earnings in 2011 for those coal units and then some of that $0.75 will then materialize in 2010 based on the final timings of Unit 1 and Unit 2. But in 2011, if you assume both are online for full-year that's $0.75 of earnings incremental.", "Gale Klappa", "What we are trying to do Andy is to give you sense of additional earnings from power of the future, once all the units are completed are in their first full-year of operation.", "Operator", "Scott Engstrom with Blenheim Capital Management, please state your question.", "Scott Engstrom - Blenheim Capital Management", "Just further nuisance on the new retail volume forecast you have. I assume your initial forecast, for example, called for a weak first half and maybe a better flat or stable second half. I'm wondering how much of the new forecast really represents the kind of a plunge here in the first quarter, or how much of it reflects less optimism on the second half of the year?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, to tell you the truth, Scott, it was a bit of both. Let me explain what I mean by that. If you look at the forecast, our original forecast for the first quarter, for residential, we were just slightly worse than that forecast. In fact, on a weather normalized basis, you might make the case that we are actually in line with the weather normalized forecast.", "On small commercial and industrial we are actually a bit better than our forecast for the first quarter. Then as you heard from our prepared remarks on large commercial and industrial, we were quite a bit worse. So for residential and small C&I, I expect the back half to be worse than what we had originally expected, therefore quite a bit worse than last year. And the reason we believe that is because of what we are seeing with unemployment trends.", "Our original underlining forecast had about 8%, 8.5% unemployment. It's likely to go say 9%, 9.5%. I think our state currently is at around 9%. Generally, what we see with electric sales, there is a bit of a lag effect. So what I'm saying is, if underlying unemployment is going to be that much worse in the back half of the year, we should see some really further degradation versus our original forecast for those two classes, but large C&I, worse thing in that right now. We saw it in the first quarter. So I would hope to begin to see a little bit of improvement there, but its improvement relative to a much lower forecast now within the year.", "Gale Klappa", "Obviously, we are trying to be appropriately conservative against what we are seeing. Particularly, I mean, we are kind of in uncharted territory. We have looked back in our records and this company has been very good at keeping records for decades. And we have not seen, and I don't think many companies have, this kind of precipitous decline in this shorter period of time ever. So we want to make sure we are appropriately conservative in terms of estimating what the second half looks like and it looks flat. It looks worse from a small C&I standpoint.", "Scott Engstrom - Blenheim Capital Management", "Could you just remind me what's your flexibility then as with respect to the rate case filing, on volumes?", "Gale Klappa", "We are very early in the rate case process. In fact, hearing dates have not yet been set, so there will be plenty of time over the course of the next four to five months as testimony is prepared, as rebuttal is put in, and as hearings take place, for us to refine our forecast and we would expect exactly to do that. We just filed the case in March and we will know much more three or four months down the road as we see more of what's happening in the real world and in the economy. So, we will refine our numbers in the rate case as we move forward and the process gives us plenty of opportunity to do so.", "Operator", "(inaudible) of Wisconsin, please state your question.", "", "Unidentified Analyst", "We're just talking about the rate requests. I missed the amounts that you mentioned before for the requests you are asking for?", "Gale Klappa", "Okay. I'll be happy to go over that again for you. Get back to the page where we have listed each one of them. [Dan], we made the filing on March 13, on our normal cycle with the Wisconsin Commission. For the electric business a $76.5 million or 2.8% increase, for Wisconsin Gas, $38.9 million or a 4.6% increase, for the gas operations of Wisconsin Electric, $22.1 million or a 3.6% increase, and then we have two small steam utilities, and for the two steam utilities $2.7 million.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Then as far as your request to change the fuel recovery for the declines that you've seen, will that go into effect sooner or when do you expect to see the impact from that part?", "Gale Klappa", "In fact, Dan it's already in effect. We filed right at the end of April for a fuel cost reduction going forward. So reduction in the fuel cost recovery rate. The Commission acted with more speed and turned that request around and the new lower fuel recovery rates went into effect, May 1.", "Allen Leverett", "So we filed April 27, I believe and the new rates went in May 1 for fuel.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was curious looking at the income statement. It looks like the other O&M was down about $35 million. What was driving that decline?", "Allen Leverett", "In terms of O&M, and unfortunately, it's not a very simple story; if you adjust we had a one time amortization of a regulatory asset in the first quarter of last year. So if you adjust for that that was about $44 million. So if you adjust for that, O&M was actually up about $25 million. But then, when you look at that $25 million, $15 million of that $25 million was associated with the increased amortization costs that I talked about. Of that $15,million roughly half was related to transmission, half was related to amortization of the [PTF] costs, and then the other $10 million was related to just O&M that was sprinkled throughout the business that was really no one big category that was driving that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "Day-to-day O&M was almost flat.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. I was curious on the Bechtel. I think I asked you last time, if you had gotten any sort of breakdown as to the various claims, and how much was related to each one. Have you been able to obtain that information from Bechtel yet? And if so, are you able to share that with us?", "Gale Klappa", "Good question, Dan. At this point there has been no additional breakdown of the elements of the claim.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then the last thing I was curious about is kind of related to, looks like you have about $800 million of short term debt, and so, I was curious, is that draws on your bank line or is that CP, or what's that?", "Allen Leverett", "It's commercial paper, Dan. And at this point, my financing plan for 2009 wouldn't call for any permanent or term financing at the holding company. The plan does call for about $250 million worth of term financing at Wisconsin Electric Power Company. And then what I would expect to do in calendar 2010, or late this year, essentially coincident with the in service date of the coal plant is do the permanent financing for the coal plants. That would be around $900 million if you put the two units together. So essentially, that $900 million will be used to pay-off short-term debt at the holding company. This year, expect a very modest amount of term financing, only about $250 million and that of the utility.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You are welcome. And the bank lines are undrawn. Operator, do we have any other questions?", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) [Julian Vermilion-Smith] with UBS. Please state you question.", "Julian Vermilion-Smith - UBS", "Just wanted to follow-up, last year you guys had talked a bit about potential legislation in Wisconsin and adjusting the fuel clause. Any updates on that front?", "Gale Klappa", "Very good question. The Wisconsin Commission does believe they need some legislative change to make it clear that they have the authority to change the administrative operation of the fuel. There is some discussion that the administration will have a complete energy package, a state energy package that would be presented to the legislature later this year.", "We believe that if the administration does follow through with an energy package piece of legislation that provides fuel rules or at least the authority for the Commission to change the fuel rules administratively would be in that package. There is also some discussion about potentially having a separate line item in the Governor's budget bill that might give the authority to the Commission to administratively change the fuel rules.", "So everything is in a bit of a state of flux as you can imagine, as the legislature is in a session, but if I were a betting man, I would say that before the end of the year, there would be something in front of the state legislature to clarify the Commission's authority to essentially change administratively the operation of the fuel rules.", "Julian Vermilion-Smith - UBS", "Thank you. From that regard, would you assume that going forward in 2010 say, in that time frame, the rules would be adjusted? Would there be sort of a sufficient amount of time for the Commission to come back and make that change official?", "Gale Klappa", "I believe there would be. There would be time so that for the calendar year 2010 we would be all operating under revised fuel rules.", "Operator", "There appear to be no further questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Klappa for any additional or closing remarks.", "Gale Klappa", "Well that concludes our conference call for today. We appreciate you taking part. If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to call Colleen Henderson in our Investor Relations office and her number is 414-221-2592. Thank you very much. Have a good day.", "Operator", "And that does conclude today's conference call.

Thank you for holding, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's conference call to review our second quarter 2009 results. (Operator Instructions)", "Before the conference call begins I will read the forward-looking language:", "All statements in this presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.", "During the discussion, reference to earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. ", "After the presentation the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. ", "In conjunction with this call Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information on its' 2009 second quarter results at www.WisconsinEnergy.com.", "A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our conference call to review the company's second quarter results.", "Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation, Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Fleming, our General Counsel, Jeff West, the company's Treasurer, and Steve Dickson, our Controller. ", "Allen will of course review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.54 a share for the second quarter of 2009. This compares with $0.49 a share for the same period in 2008. ", "Now I'd like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our power of the future plan is fundamental to the principle of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle gas-fired units at Port Washington, north of Milwaukee, the construction of two supercritical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city, and building a significant amount of renewable generation.", "As we've discussed on previous calls, both units at Port Washington are in service. Construction was completed on time and on budget. The units are among the most efficient in the Midwest market and our customers are now benefiting from the low price of natural gas that fuels these units.", "Let's turn now to the status of the two new coal-fired units at Oak Creek. Based on Bechtel's revised schedule, Unit 1 and the common facilities are now more than 97% complete and Unit\u00a02 is approximately 62% complete. I'm pleased to report that we reached a major milestone at Oak Creek on July 23 when the main Unit 1 boiler was fired successfully for the first time using natural gas. This milestone, of course, can only be accomplished after the essential plant systems are built and the instrumentation and controls are in place. ", "Looking forward at Oak Creek, the critical activities from now to the commercial operation of Unit 1 include blowing steam through the boiler tubes and piping to clean them of all scale and construction debris. These steam blows are scheduled to begin as early as today. After the steam blows are complete the unit will be fired on coal and the generator will be synchronized to the grid. Bechtel will then tune and test the plant up to full load before beginning a series of required performance tests. The performance tests include a 15-day reliability run.", "Bechtel continues to target the commercial operation of Unit 1 by the end of December this year. The first fire milestone occurred approximately five and a half weeks later than Bechtel's target schedule; however, Bechtel has developed a plan that if successful would recover that time by making up one week of the schedule between now and first fire on coal and then making up the remainder of the time during fine-tuning and testing. Bechtel also continues to target commercial operation of Unit\u00a02 by the end of August 2010.", "Now, as you know, Bechtel filed a formal claim last December seeking relief under the contract. Bechtel cited a number of factors, including weather conditions in the winters of 2006 and 2007, heavy rains in the spring of 2008, and what Bechtel believes to be changes in local labor conditions. The claims for schedule and cost relief related to these factors total $413 million. ", "Bechtel also stated its belief that the weather events constitute a force majeure. ", "Now, we simply don't believe there is a contractual basis for some of the claims that Bechtel has submitted. For example, we disagree that Bechtel is entitled to cost or schedule relief as a result of alleged changes in the labor market. Further, we do not believe that Bechtel has complied with the contractual requirements for filing the claims.", "Bechtel also filed a $72 million claim for the alleged affects of changes and delays prior to the issuance of the full notice to proceed back in July of 2005. We believe this claim is without merit and that Bechtel was fully compensated for any and all impacts of the delayed start.", "Finally, Bechtel has asked for six months' of relief from liquidated damages beyond the September\u00a029, 2009 guaranteed date for Unit 1 and three months' of relief from liquidated damages beyond the September 29, 2010 guaranteed date for Unit 2. ", "As we've mentioned to you in the past, we expect the claims to be resolved through the contract's formal dispute resolution process. We were unable to resolve our differences with Bechtel in non-binding mediation, so we recently initiated binding arbitration, which is the final stage of the dispute process. The arbitration is likely to be completed some time in 2010.", "As we assess these developments, I believe there are several key points to keep in mind. First, we are still recovering carrying costs associated with the construction of these units under the terms of the lease agreements between Wisconsin Electric and We Power. We are recovering, based on a mix of debt and equity, our capital carrying costs as construction continues on the Oak Creek project. We're allowed to recover our carrying costs up to the total budget for the project that has been approved by the Wisconsin Commission, so we believe our ability to recover cash carry costs should be largely unaffected by a slight change in the construction schedule.", "I would also like to reiterate an important point about the ultimate recovery of any potential cost increases. We believe we have several layers of protection for recovery of our costs. ", "To conclude, for example, that an additional cost is not ultimately recoverable you would have to believe that the cost will not qualify for recovery under at least four opportunities - first, that any remaining contingency in the project is not sufficient to offset the cost; second, that the cost would fall outside the 5% ban that the Commission has deemed reasonable for prudent costs above the approved amount for the project; third, that the cost was not caused by a force majeure event as defined by the lease agreements; and finally, after an opportunity to demonstrate prudency, that the cost would be ultimately deemed imprudent.", "One more important point before we move on. Liquidated damage payments will be due from Bechtel on Unit 1 unless it is determined that any days granted for schedule relief are equal to or exceed the delay in the schedule. Of course, as we move forward we'll provide you with updates on any major developments to our SEC filings and on our scheduled calls. ", "Now turning to renewables, the State of Wisconsin has a renewable portfolio standard that increases from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each of Wisconsin's utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.5% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in the year 2015. Meeting that aggressive 2015 target will require a mix of additional projects and short-term purchased power agreements.", "Of course, with the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm last year, we took a major step toward meeting Wisconsin's goal to reduce its carbon footprint. With a total of 88\u00a0turbines, each with the capacity of 1.65 megawatts, Blue Sky Green Field is the largest wind farm to date in Wisconsin. It was completed under budget and ahead of schedule.", "Last summer as you might recall we also completed the purchase from FPL Energy of a new wind farm development site in East Central Wisconsin. This site is called the Glacier Hills Wind Park. In October of 2008 we filed for approval to build on the site and our application was deemed complete in January of this year. That started a 360-day review process by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. ", "In May we also announced a conditional agreement with Vestas Wind Systems for turbines capable of producing approximately 162 megawatts at an attractive price. Then just a few days ago the Wisconsin Commission issued a draft environmental impact statement for the project. Public hearings are now expected to be held in late October or early November of this year, and a final decision by the Commission on our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity should be made in January of 2010. Assuming Commission approval, the first full year of operation for Glacier Hills is expected to be 2012.", "We're also developing proposals to build between 50 and 100 megawatts of new biomass generation. We're fortunate to be close to significant forest lands that can be harvested in a sustainable manner and are producing large amounts of wood waste which we can purchase to fuel these plants. As compared to wind, the benefit from an operational standpoint of biomass generation is that we can dispatch these plants. We're now in the final stage of completing our feasibility review and I expect we will make an announcement regarding our biomass plans in the very near future. ", "Construction is also under way on a major upgrade of the air quality controls at the existing coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We expect the cost of this new environmental facility will be $960\u00a0million. That includes allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas to sulphurisation and selective catalytic reduction facilities. These controls are scheduled to be completed in 2012.", "Turning now to the rate reviews that we have under way, on March 13 we filed a general rate case on our normal cycle for our Wisconsin Energy and Wisconsin Gas utilities. The filing included a request for a $76 million or 2.8% increase to support electric operations, a $39\u00a0million or 4.6% increase for Wisconsin Gas operations, a $22 million or 3.6% increase for Wisconsin Energy gas operations, and a $2.7 million increase for our two steam utilities.", "Since we filed the case in March our forecasted electric sales for the 2010 test year have declined. To reflect this updated data we filed supplemental testimony in early July that increased our request from $76 million to $126 million. So the previous rate increase request of 2.8% for our retail Wisconsin customers has now risen to 3.9%. This new amount also reflects an increase in available Point Beach bill credits in light of lower sales expectations. We did not change our requests for our gas or our steam utilities. ", "A schedule was set by the Commission for the case at a prehearing conference on June 25. The next milestone will be the filing of direct testimony by Commission staff and interveners, and that is due on September 3rd. Technical and public hearings are likely to be held in the fall and we expect new rates will be in effect in January of 2010.", "We also filed this month for an electric rate increase of $42 million in Wisconsin Electric's Michigan jurisdiction. This request is driven primarily by the need to recover our investment and our operational costs associated with the new Oak Creek units. ", "We're proposing to implement this request in three phases. The first phase is for approximately $22 million and primarily reflects the commercial operation of the first Oak Creek unit. This increase would be expected to occur in conjunction with the commercial operation of Unit 1. The second phase would occur when the Michigan Commission issues its decision for the 2010 test year. That is anticipated to be in July of 2010. Assuming our request is approved, this amounts to an additional $16 million. Finally, if our request is approved when the second Oak Creek unit enters commercial service, the final amount - approximately $4 million - would become effective. In Michigan, of course, any amounts that we would self-implement are subject to refund with interest at the cost of equity.", "The Michigan Commission has not yet set a schedule for hearing our requests, but under Michigan law the Commission must act within a year of the filing or the rates would become effective as filed.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Allen, who'll give you more details on our financial performance for the second quarter. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Thank you, Gale. ", "Now, as Gale mentioned earlier, our second quarter 2009 earnings from continuing operations were $0.54 per share. I'll focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows for the first six months and discuss our earnings guidance for 2009.", "Our consolidated operating income was $119 million as compared to $108 million in the second quarter of 2008, for an increase of $11 million. Operating income in our Utility Energy segment totaled $90 million, which is comparable with the second quarter of 2008. ", "On the positive side, we had a $10 million reversal of a charge that we took in the first quarter related to revenue sufficiency guarantee credits from MISO, which I will expand upon later. ", "Our utility non-fuel O&M costs are $12 million lower than last year in the second quarter as we took action in response to economic conditions. These actions included a hiring freeze. ", "In addition, while we experienced an unseasonably cool June, it was closer to normal than last year. More favorable weather resulted in a $4 million increase in operating income as compared to the prior year. ", "We also had fuel recoveries that were $2 million better than in 2008. ", "Partially offsetting these factors was a $23 million decline attributable to lower retail sales as a result of the downturn in the economy. ", "Our utility depreciation expense is $4 million higher as a result of higher plant balances. ", "When we net all other factors together, we come to flat utility operating income as compared to the second quarter of 2008. ", "Now I wanted to briefly discuss the $10 million reversal of the first quarter charge related to MISO credits. In the first quarter we told you that we took a $10 million charge because the Wisconsin Commission had ordered us to refund $10 million of MISO-related credits that we hoped to receive later this year. At that time we expected to be neutral for the year if the credits came through; however, because of the uncertainty associated with the credits, our policy is to recognize them only when they are received.", "In May the FERC issued rulings that significantly reduced the amount of MISO credits that we were to receive. As a result of the FERC rulings we requested the deferral letter that would allow us to recover from customers any refunds that we gave them that were not ultimately covered by credits from MISO. The Wisconsin Commission granted the deferral and based on this we were able to reverse the first quarter charge. ", "In summary, on the first quarter conference call we told you that we expected the first quarter charge to reverse by the end of the year as the MISO credits were received. Now, with the deferral, the charge was reversed at the end of the second quarter.", "As expected, our non-utility operating income was up $11 million. The key drivers of this increase relate to a full quarter's earnings contribution from Unit 2 at Port Washington, which was placed into service in late May of 2008, and the water intake system at Oak Creek that was placed into service in January of this year. We do not expect to see this large of an increase in the third and fourth quarters as the earnings from Unit 2 at Port Washington will be comparable for these quarters. ", "Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $2 million in 2009 and in 2008. Taking the changes for each of these segments together brings you back to the $11 million increase in operating income for this quarter.", "During the second quarter of 2009 earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased $2 million and all other income was relatively level.", "Interest expense increased $5 million because of interest expense associated with Unit 2 at Port Washington as well as additional long-term debt issued during the fourth quarter of 2008. ", "Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $2 million, primarily because of higher pre-tax earnings. I expect that our annual effective tax rate in 2009 will be approximately 37%. ", "Combining all of these items brings you to $64 million of net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2009 or earnings of $0.54 per share. ", "During the first six months of 2009 we generated $232 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is down $341 million from the same period in 2008. While our cash earnings were up, there were two large factors that reduced our cash from operations. ", "First, we contributed $289 million to our benefit plans in January of 2009, of which $270\u00a0million went to fund our pension plan. In the first six months of last year our contributions to benefit plans totaled $48 million. ", "The second factor which reduced cash from operations related to working capital items primarily associated with inventory balances. ", "On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $335\u00a0million as compared to $728 million in the first six months of 2008. The adjusted number includes $103 million of cash impact from the bill credits in 2009 and $154 million in 2008. Under GAAP, the cash from the bill credits is reflected in the change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From a management standpoint we consider this a source of cash as it relates directly to the bill credits and the one-time amortization.", "Our total capital expenditures were approximately $365 million in the first six months of 2009, which is down from $642 million in the first six months of 2008. On an annual basis, we expect our capital expenditures to be about $275 million lower than 2008 capital expenditures as we move closer to the completion of our power of the future construction program.", "On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 58.2% as of June 30, and we were at 55.2% on an adjusted basis. This is essentially flat compared to our December 31, 2008 levels, even when considering the $289 million contribution to our benefit plans in January of this year. I would expect our debt-to-capital ratio to increase slightly by the end of this year as compared to last year. Our goal is to maintain our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at no more than 60% during the period we are constructing our new coal-fired generation.", "We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "In the second quarter we continued to see the economic recession impact our electric sales. Generally, our service territory has a well-diversified industrial and commercial mix that helps mitigate the impact of economic downturns; however, in this economy we are seeing four sectors dramatically affected. They include iron ore minor, paper production, primary metals and the automotive part sector. ", "Our electricity sales to large commercial and industrial customers dropped by 21.8% in the second quarter as compared to the second quarter of 2008. Excluding sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines, our large commercial and industrial sales were down 16.2%. Electricity used by small commercial and industrial customers declined by 5.4%. Consumption of electricity by residential customers was up 0.2%. ", "Over the past several weeks we have seen strong anecdotal evidence that industrial production and economic output are stabilizing. Several sectors have held up well in this economic downturn. The health care and food products segments have remained constant in their energy usage when compared to last year, and most of the other segments have leveled out after a double-digit drop in sales.", "During our first quarter call we provided new guidance on our electric sales forecast for 2009. I would like to comment on where we see our annual sales in light of the second quarter results. Our second quarter sales came in slightly lower than our May forecast. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales came in about 11% less than the second quarter of 2008. We had expected a 9% decline. The majority of the decline came from the large commercial and industrial class, which had a decline of 22% versus a forecasted decline of 16%. ", "Taking into account the results of the second quarter, we are adjusting our overall annual sales outlook slightly. Our previous outlook for electric sales called for an 8.1% decline in kilowatt hour sales in 2009 as compared to 2008. We now estimate the decline will be approximately 8.5%. However, based on what we've seen in the detailed sales mix by customer class, we are not changing our gross margin or our annual earnings estimates. ", "Our earnings guidance for 2009 remains in the range of $3.05 to $3.15 per share. Our first six months came in stronger than we expected because of cold winter weather, favorable fuel collections, and cost reductions across every segment of our business. As we mentioned in the first quarter call, we expect the favorable fuel collections to partially reverse in the second half of the year; however, I still expect that we will be in a positive fuel recovery position of approximately $20 million for calendar year 2009. ", "In addition temperatures in July have been well below normal and cooling demand has been low. Our current forecast for earnings in the third quarter is $0.46 to $0.51 per share. This projection is below our earnings in the third quarter of 2008 largely because of the timing of electric fuel cost recovery as compared to last year as well as the cool July weather.", "So with that I'll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Allen, thank you very much. ", "I would just like to add - before we open up for questions I'd like to add some additional perspective on the downturn in industrial energy use across our region. ", "The numbers clearly show weak production levels and there has been a significant loss of manufacturing jobs throughout our service area; however, the overall unemployment rate in Wisconsin remains better than the national average at 9.2%, and while many manufacturers have eliminated second and third shift operations and all weekend work, we are not experiencing a significant number of new plant closures. As Allen said a bit earlier, we've seen over the past few weeks strong anecdotal evidence that energy demand from our large commercial and industrial customers is stabilizing. ", "On another positive note, a modest amount of customer growth is continuing in our region. At the end of June we were serving nearly 3,400 more electric customers and approximately 2,300 more natural gas customers than a year ago. Overall we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "And now we would like to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) ", "Your first question comes from Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley.", "Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley", "You've made the update to the rate case based on what you're seeing in terms of the evolving expectations for electricity demand. Is that the only adjustment you'll be able to make? I know you said you think you're seeing a stabilization of demand, but if you were to see a significant change in demand between now and, let's say, November and December, would you be able to make another adjustment or would it be too late in the rate case cycle?", "Gale Klappa", "Greg, very good question. Essentially the way the process works in Wisconsin is up until the time that we filed additional direct testimony we had a window to update our data and we were able to do that. Pretty much now, as we work our way between today and the decision by the Commission, the sales data and the sales forecast is about locked in. ", "What we will, though, have an opportunity to update is fuel. But the historic practice of the Wisconsin Commission is to take a look at the November strip for natural gas, for example, and update the fuel forecast numbers very late in the process so that they have a pretty good up-to-date look at what our fuel costs are going to be before the final decision.", "So no additional update, we would not expect at all, on the sales forecast, but we would expect very updated and current fuel numbers to factor into the decision in December.", "Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley", "And in the interim really your earnings power at the utility on an ongoing basis, I'm presuming, will be predicated on, one, economic conditions hopefully being comparable to what's in the filing and you getting consistent rate-making treatment, but in the short run is it fair to say that, to summarize what you've said on the call, anyway, you're offsetting the softness of sales partly through the benefit of how steeply fuel has dropped and the way your fuel adjustment clause works and partly through temporary cost reductions?", "Gale Klappa", "Correct. You're absolutely right, Greg. In the near term probably the single biggest impact on our earnings will be the weather.", "Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley", "When I look at your CapEx budget, the last time I checked you gave a forecast out through 2011. There's a little over $400 million in there for renewables. Which projects does that include? Does that include a placeholder for any of these biomass or not-yet-announced additions that you need to meet that mandate?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, the expenditures that we had certainly for 2009, 2010, 2011, that would be more related to wind projects, primarily to Glacier Hills, so that would just be wind projects. Longer term, as Gale talked about with biomass, there certainly could be expenditures past 2011 for biomass, but in that three-year outlook from '09 to '11 we didn't include any capital expenditures for biomass.", "Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley", "So any incremental renewable projects that you enter into to meet your mandate above and beyond what you've explicitly announced would be additional CapEx? I just wanted to make sure there wasn't some amount in that '11 number that was sort of notional for future projects. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "I don't view any of the '09 to '11 numbers as notional; however, as Gale talked about, we're still in the midst of the approval process with the Commission, so although we expect a good result there, we haven't brought that to completion yet. ", "Greg Gordon - Morgan Stanley", "The environmental spending is for the Oak Creek project, for which the last year is '12? ", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct. And all of the environmental spend that you see or virtually 100% of the environmental spend you see in the breakdown of our capital projections is for this huge environmental upgrade at the existing Oak Creek units.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "The $11 million from the construction projects, can you break that out between Port Washington and the water intake?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Sure. The $11 million I would say that roughly - well, let me talk about it in terms of maybe the first half. I think $16 million in the first half of the year was from Port Washington No. 2, so that gives it to you for the first half. Then of the roughly $11 million within the quarter I would say that probably $1.5 million was the water system and the balance was Port Washington. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "And then what was the absolute fuel over or under recovery in the quarter?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Sure, let me just go through that. And maybe in terms of the quarter, the absolute for the quarter was a $4.4 million under recovery for the quarter, second quarter. And that's about, I mean, if you compare, Paul, to the second quarter of 2008, that's about a $1.5 million swing positive, meaning that we were about $5.9 million under recovered in the second quarter of 2008 and then the second quarter of this year, $4.4 million under recovered for a positive swing of $1.5 million. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "I thought we had a month of still very strong over recoveries in the quarter. How did we switch to getting negative?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, in the second quarter, you remember, we had the fuel rate refund - excuse me, the reduction in the fuel rate. And so what we're collecting now is lower than what we had in the past.", "Gale Klappa", "We had one, April, was a positive month; then new fuel recovery rates when into effect in very early May, so you see May and June being slightly lower. ", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "But you're under recovered, so did fuel move between the time you set your new rates to the time you started buying gas?", "Gale Klappa", "No, Paul, but remember, April is a shoulder month with very low demand, so you're not going to see huge swings in fuel one way or another in the month of April and we didn't. But now we have the lower fuel rate in effect, and I think what really Allen is telling you is that we think we will be reasonably recovered, maybe a slight slip in the second half in terms of actual fuel costs for the second half compared to fuel recovery rate. We might see a $4 slip in the second half, but we expect to be pretty close to fully recovered with a new fuel recovery rate in the second half.", "Allen L. Leverett", "For the year, Paul, just to be clear, so for the first half of the year we were about $24.2 million in a positive recovery situation on fuel, so that's for the first half of the year. And then as Gale mentioned, we for the second half of the year would expect to be under recovered about $4.2\u00a0million. So for the year we would expect to be in a $20 million positive recovery position on fuel.", "Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Can you just update us on how bad debt is tracking and remind us of recovery mechanisms?", "Gale Klappa", "Allen and I can both handle it. Actually, we're doing reasonably well and surprisingly well on bad debt. Essentially, arrears greater than 60 days are only about $7 million higher than a year ago and essentially we have protection for arrears greater than what is in rates, what is being collected in rates on the residential side of the business, where we can escrow essentially bad debt write-offs above what is being collected in rates for residential customers. So we're really hanging in there just fine at the moment, Paul.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "Gale or Allen, I was hoping to get a little more granularity on the O&M cuts - I think, Allen, you cited a $12 million impact in the quarter - just to understand how much if any of that is sort of ongoing. And when I think ongoing I think sort of full year '10 versus '09, and then maybe you can think about the last two quarters of this year. ", "Gale Klappa", "Both Allen and I will give you our views. ", "First of all, you are correct. Our ongoing operation and maintenance expenses in the second quarter of this year were $12 million less than Q2 of a year ago. Probably the biggest driver is the hiring freeze. ", "We began really to take action on very specific initiatives to reduce costs even lower really in the third quarter of last year. We began to see some troubling signs in demand and with the economy, and we really started to take action, I think, quite early. So we've had a hiring freeze in place for many months now and that is the biggest single driver of the reduction in O&M.", "But, Jay, we've got literally hundreds of initiatives - cost reduction, cost control initiatives - going on all across this enterprise, many of them very little things like completely re-thinking the number of copiers we need in the offices. But it just gives you an idea of the depth to which we're looking at efficiency and cost.", "And I might add, if you look back for a little bit longer look, our full-time equivalent headcount is 11% lower or about 590 people lower than it was at the end of December, 2004, and that is even in view of the fact that we've added about $1.2 billion of generation-related assets that have to be managed with new people. So I'm very pleased with what we're seeing in terms of our employees focusing on costs and the results that we're seeing from cost reduction.", "And then, Jay, to your question about will we continue to see some benefit from cost reduction in the second half, I think the answer is yes in large part because the initiatives we have under way will continue and so will the hiring freeze.", "Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Although - and Gale mentioned this, Jay - you remember we really started seeing the benefits of that hiring freeze in the second half of this year, so I don't think it would be appropriate to say all right, well, we started that in the second half of '08; you already had started those initiatives. So incremental I wouldn't expect to see yet again the sort of impacts that we saw in the first half of the year.", "Gale Klappa", "Percentages. ", "Allen L. Leverett", "A lot of those [inaudible] in the second half. ", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "Is my recollection right? I thought you had described first quarter O&M as flat, so if these initiatives were under way I'm a little confused as to why we didn't see much of it in the first quarter, now we're seeing it in the second quarter. Is there some lack of predictability to it given it's driven by a hiring freeze?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes, there's one other item related to amortizations in the rate case. There were $15 million of regulatory amortizations that we had to take in the first quarter of this year that did not occur in the first quarter of 2008, and I think that was about $15 million. So that $15 million of costs went through the income statement in the first quarter.", "Gale Klappa", "And it masked some of the underlying O&M savings.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "Last question, on the Bechtel dispute, now that you've gone to binding arbitration, how transparent is that process going to be? I know we got an update last quarter, now we get one here. Will there be updates throughout that process or does now it sort of go behind closed doors and sort of pop out when we get a final decision in '10?", "Gale Klappa", "A very good question, Jay. Under the contract that we have with Bechtel, the binding arbitration process is supposed to be confidential. If there are any material developments, though, obviously we would announce those developments. But day-to-day back-and-forth, what schedule is being followed, that is all under confidentiality per the contract.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "And now that you're in binding arbitration I assume settlement sort of happens if it's going to occur at the 11th hour. There's certainly no incentive for either party to sort of go to settlement prior to that.", "Gale Klappa", "Jay, it's very hard to make that decision or really comment on that because it really depends upon, I think, how motivated Bechtel might be as the hearing process and testimony process really unfolds. ", "But, again, I think we feel like we have a very strong case here.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "Your coal and transport needs for the new coal units, have they been contracted yet or are they yet to be contracted?", "Gale Klappa", "For the new Oak Creek units?", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "Yes.", "Allen L. Leverett", "We've got coal on the ground right now and we have delivery scheduled. ", "Gale Klappa", "And rail contracts in place.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "You mentioned that you're going to have the opportunity to kind of put in a new fuel forecast for the 2010 rate year and so the numbers you quoted at the beginning of the call - a 3.9% rate increase\u00a0 is that the full rate including your forecast of fuel and purchased power at the time or is that just the base rate increase?", "Gale Klappa", "No, that would include any fuel forecast changes, so the 3.9% across the retail group of customers is a net, basically, of base rate increases and fuel changes.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "And what was the vintage of the fuel and power forecast determining that 3.9% increase?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, we filed in March and I don't think we changed anything but the sales forecast with our July testimony, so that would have been early first quarter.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "I'm just curious if you were to kind of mark your open position for fuel and purchased power, to mark it based on a decline in gas prices and the big drop in power prices, if you've got any sense for what that - if you were to do that forecast today if it might be a little bit less than 3.9% or potentially flat?", "Gale Klappa", "I don't think it would be flat in part because we have a very big percentage of our power supply coming from coal-fired units and our purchased power agreement from Point Beach for the nuclear generation. And those costs, I mean, we have long-term coal contract costs, we have a long-term cost-specific purchased power agreement with FPL, so those costs are not subject to huge change. ", "The big swing, if there is a swing, would be in the portion of our generation from gas-fired generation or MISO purchases. ", "Steve, it's just things move around so much day-to-day and we'll just have to see as we get closer to December. But I do think it's a positive the way the Wisconsin Commission updates its fuel forecast numbers to make as accurate a decision as they can.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "Can you just remind what portion of your generation output at [WeCo] is kind of tied to gas prices?", "Gale Klappa", "Less than 15% in terms of just our own generation.", "Steve Gambuza - Longbow Capital", "So I guess it's that piece plus whatever purchased power you have that would really be moving?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes. And Rick is saying it will shift a lot next year as we bring the Oak Creek units on, but you're right, it's two pieces - it's our own gas-fired generation and then the affect of gas on the margin in MISO for purchased power. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities.", "Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities", "Just a quick question on the rate case. I understand that staff testimony is due, I think, September\u00a03rd, but have you had any indication or input as to how the recent higher revenue request has been received in the state?", "Gale Klappa", "We had one front-page story in the Milwaukee paper, probably a dozen customer calls, and really that's about it. ", "I think one of the other factors in play here is that every single Wisconsin utility has filed for a rate case this year, so the five major utilities that operate in Wisconsin all have filed for rate cases, and our 3.9% increase is at the low end of anybody's ask. I think Wisconsin Power and Light is up above 9%; some of the others are in the 5% to 7% range. ", "And clearly what's driving the lion's share of our request is recovery of the final stages of power of the future, and I think folks have a good understanding that we've had to invest in infrastructure that's going to serve customers here well for the next 50 years.", "Neil Kalton - Wells Fargo Securities", "And I guess it would be fair to say that the incrementally higher request is probably not a big surprise, right?", "Gale Klappa", "No. We had signaled that that was likely to happen as we got more economic data and real world experience with what the first several months of our industrial demand looked like.", "But, again, if you think about what fundamentally happened, the original ask was a 2.8% increase; it went to 3.9%, so it's not like there was a huge, dramatic change.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Allen, can you talk about what you think your earnings sensitivity is this year for kind of like every 1% change in your demand forecast for the back half of the year? ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, when you say demand, maybe if I could answer it in terms of energy rather than demand, I would guess that for the year if you saw a 1% change in overall sales it's probably on the order of $20\u00a0million. If you were then looking for just six months it's probably $10 million. And those numbers are margin figures, Michael, so not total revenues. ", "Gale Klappa", "Pre-tax.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes, so pre-tax gross margin, those are, I think, reasonable numbers - rules of thumb.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, I just want to make sure I follow you. So in other words, if actuals deviate from your demand forecast for the rest of the year by 100 basis points for kilowatt hour sales, it's roughly $10\u00a0million pre-tax.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes, pre-tax gross margin, right.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I know that a number of the other utilities in the state have filed cases. What's kind of the range of ROE and equity layer requests by some of your peers in the state versus what you've asked for?", "Gale Klappa", "I think, Michael, most of the companies that have filed in the state have essentially asked for the same capital structure going forward as is in place today and the same return on equity. ", "So, for example, we said that even though we think the cost of capital has been re-priced and risk has been re-priced - and you could make an argument that the cost of equity is higher than two years ago - we would, in light of the economic conditions, just ask for 10-7-5 is our allowed return on equity and roughly a 52% to 53% equity layer in our capital structure, again, unchanged from the prior rate decision.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "I remember - and it's been a little bit since I've looked at it - is that 52% or 53% based on your GAAP equity layer or is that based on your regulated equity layer and is GAAP likely higher or lower?", "Gale Klappa", "It's based on the regulated, but I'm not certain whether the GAAP is - ", "Allen L. Leverett", "Meaning it includes some debt equivalents.", "Gale Klappa", "All right.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, I'll take this offline.", "Operator", "", "Well, Mr. Klappa, we have no further questions, sir, so I'll turn it back to you.", "Gale Klappa", "Outstanding.

This conference is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. ", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made. ", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. ", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website, a package of detailed financial information on its 2009 year end results at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call. ", "Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Arlene, thank you. Good afternoon everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our conference call to review the company\u2019s 2009 year end results. ", "Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy Management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation; Alan Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, our venerable General Counsel; Jeff West, Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, Controller. Allen will of course review our financial results in detail in just a moment. ", "As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.20 a share for 2009. This compares with $3.03 a share for 2008. While we saw a significant decline in the sale of electricity, because of the recession and a very cool summer, our 2009 earnings were boosted by a full year\u2019s contribution from our Power, the Future investments in the second generating unit at Port Washington, and the water intake system at Oak Creek, and by significant cost reductions across our business. ", "Overall I\u2019m very pleased with our financial and operational performance. From customer satisfaction to network reliability, to progress on our Power the Future plan, the company made great strides during the year, and in a tough economy, we posted solid financial results. ", "Now I\u2019d like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power the Future plan is fundamental to the principle of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle gas fired units at Port Washington, north of Milwaukee; the construction of two supercritical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city; and building a significant amount of renewable generation. ", "As we\u2019ve discussed on our previous calls, both units at Port Washington are in service. Construction was completed on time and on budget. The units are among the most efficient in the Midwest market that are operating well, and our customers are now benefiting from the low price of natural gas that fuels these units. ", "Let\u2019s turn now to the status of the two new coal fired units at Oak Creek: I\u2019m delighted to report that Unit 1 has passed all of its performance tests and was declared commercial today at a minute after midnight. The critical performance measures included an efficiency test, various emission tests, a capacity test, and a 15-day reliability run. ", "I\u2019d like to mention to you that the results of these tests are of particular note. The efficiency tests or what we call the heat rate test, measures the efficiency at which the unit converts fuel into electricity. The more efficient the unit, the less coal we have to burn, and therefore the lower the cost for each unit of electricity produced. ", "For Unit 1 of the Oak Creek expansion, the demonstrated heat rate is 5% better than the guarantee, and places this unit among the best four or five coal fired plants in the country in terms of efficiency. ", "With regard to emissions, we have been even more impressed by the plant\u2019s initial performance. The recorded emission levels for each of the 15 pollutants measured at the stack were significantly lower than the levels allowed by our air permit. In many cases such as sulfur dioxide, particulate matter, and mercury, the levels were actually a fraction of that allowed. ", "The guaranteed capacity as you know of each unit is 615 megawatts net. This means that the unit must be capable of delivering 615 megawatts into the transmission network. Well, during the testing, the output was measured at 622 megawatts, and we believe the unit can actually deliver significantly more than 622 megawatts, based on the extra margin available in both the boiler and the steam turbine generator. ", "Of course time flies when you\u2019re having fun, but we first announced our Power the Future plan ten years ago, to break Wisconsin\u2019s dependence on expensive out of state energy, and to ensure a reliable supply of electricity to our customers in the decade ahead. With today\u2019s announcement, we have take in a huge step towards completing the Power the Future plan. ", "As you know, the new coal units at Oak Creek have been particularly challenging. Four of the project\u2019s five major permits faced legal challenges, all of which have now been resolved. We had to battle two of the worst winters in history, including the \u201807, \u201808 winter, which saw the highest recorded snowfall in Milwaukee in 100 years, but with the focus and determination of Bechtel, and thousands of skilled craft workers, we were able to complete this first unit at Oak Creek within 120 hours of the revised guaranteed in-service date. ", "As for Unit 2, I\u2019m pleased to report that Bechtel continues to make good progress. Unit 2 is now approximately 87% complete, and Bechtel has started turning over the major systems from its construction group to its start-up team. The boiler and feed water systems have been successfully pressure tested in Unit 2, and the unit\u2019s piping is now being chemically cleaned to prepare for first fire on gas. That\u2019s the next major milestone, first fire on gas, and it\u2019s scheduled for mid April. ", "The turbine generator has been installed at Unit 2. It\u2019s been aligned and enclosed, and the turbine bearing oil is currently being flushed in preparation for the turbine to be placed on the turning gear. Although the new guaranteed in-service date is November 28 for Unit 2, Bechtel is still targeting commercial operation by the end of August. ", "Now as we reported to you in December, we have settled all claims with Bechtel that were raised in the arbitration proceeding. Through its claims, Bechtel was seeking additional construction costs of $517 million, and schedule relief of seven months and four months for the completion of Units 1 and 2 respectively. ", "Our settlement includes the following elements: We agreed to pay Bechtel $72 million, including a $10 million payment that was made in December, and $62 million to be paid in six additional installments tied to the achievement of specific project milestones. As one of three co-owners, we are responsible for approximately 85% of the $72 million. Bechtel received 120 days of scheduled relief for Unit 1, and 60 days of scheduled relief of Unit 2. This extended the guaranteed turnover date for Unit 1 to January 27 of this year, and for Unit 2 till November 28, again of this year. ", "Finally, Bechtel released us from all matters related to their claims in the arbitration, and in return we\u2019ve released Bechtel from all matters related to our claims in the arbitration. As we move forward, we will continue to update you on the progress of Unit 2, as well as recovery of any costs that might be above the approved amount. ", "Turning now to other important developments over the last few months; a bill containing an extensive set of policy recommendations, designed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases was introduced in the Wisconsin legislature. The bill would establish statewide goals for carbon dioxide reductions, increase the requirements for generating electricity from renewable sources, and establish new efficiency targets across the state. ", "First, the bill would strengthen Wisconsin\u2019s existing renewable portfolio standard, by moving up the deadline for the 10% mandate from the year 2015 to 2013; and the bill would also set new goals of 20% renewable by 2020 and 25% by 2025. Next, the bill would set a state-wide goal to achieve a 2% reduction in energy usage by the year 2015 and annual reductions thereafter. The bill would also authorize the Wisconsin Commission to allow an investor owned utility to earn a return on capital that would be invested in energy conservation or efficiency equipment that would be installed on a customer\u2019s premise. ", "Finally, the bill proposes a number of changes to the regulation of nuclear power plants. One of those proposals would allow the Wisconsin Commission to approve a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build a new nuclear plant. ", "The next steps include a series of public hearings that are set to take place between now and late February. We expect some form of the bill would then be considered by both houses of the Wisconsin legislature. Of course our renewable investment plans were designed to meet the standards that are currently in place in Wisconsin. These standards call for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. ", "The standard sets targets, as you may recall for each of the utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewables in the year 2015. With the completion of our Blue Sky Greenfield Wind Farm in 2008, we took a major step toward meeting Wisconsin\u2019s goals to reduce its carbon footprint. With a total of 88 turbines, each with a capacity of 1.65 megawatts, Blue Sky Greenfield is the largest wind farm to date in Wisconsin. It was completed under budget and ahead of schedule. ", "Then in 2008, we purchased a new wind farm development site that\u2019s approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. The site was purchased from FPL Energy as part of our sale of the Point Beach Nuclear Plant. This site, which we call the Glacier Hills Wind Park, is an ideal location for our newest wind farm. Last week the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines capable of producing between 135 and 207 megawatts, depending of course on the turbines we select. ", "As part of the authorization, the Commission changed certain of the criteria, which could impact our ability to cite a few of the proposed turbines. The precise number of turbines therefore at Glacier Hills will be determined in the coming months, as we incorporate the commission\u2019s citing requirements into the project design, but we\u2019re pleased to be moving forward on what will certainly be a sizable new wind farm to help us meet the renewable mandate in Wisconsin. ", "The first full year of operation for Glacier Hills is projected to be 2012. Our current estimate for capital costs for Glacier Hills ranges from $335 million to $414 million, again depending upon which turbines are selected. Our range of estimates does not include any AFUDC or reimbursable transmission costs. ", "Last fall, we also announced our plans to build a 50 megawatt biomass fuel power plant at a paper mill site in northern Wisconsin. The paper mill is owned and operated by Domtar Corporation. The purchase of wood, waste wood, and saw dust will be managed by Domtar. We\u2019re fortunate to be close to significant forest lands that can be harvested, and are being harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to fuel the plant. ", "Diversification of our renewable energy supply is one of our important goals. As compared to wind, the clear benefit from an operational standpoint is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. Our gross investment in this biomass project is expected to be approximately $250 million, with a targeted in-service date in late 2013. With the potential investment tax credit of 30%, our net investment would be approximately $175 million. Our current plan is to file for construction authority with the Wisconsin Commission by the end of the first quarter of this year. ", "Finally, we\u2019re also considering approximately 12.5 megawatts of solar projects, with a targeted in-service date of 2013 for the initial investment. Of course, all of these projects are subject to commission review and approval. ", "Construction is also underway on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the existing coal fired units at Oak Creek. We plan to invest approximately $960 million. This is the second largest construction project in our company\u2019s history, and that $960 million estimate includes allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of a Wet Flue Gas Desulfurization, and selective catalytic reduction facilities. Expect these controls to be completed in the year 2012. ", "Turning now to rate case developments; as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission in December authorized adjustments to electric, natural gas, and steam rates for Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. The Commission approved an increase of approximately $85.8 million or about 3.35% in retail electric rates for Wisconsin Electric. ", "The Commission also approved a decrease of approximately $2 million or about a third of a percent for natural gas service for Wisconsin Electric, an increase of approximately $5.7 million or seven-tenth of a percent for natural gas service for Wisconsin Gas customers, and a decrease of about $400,000 or about 1.6% for Wisconsin Electric\u2019s downtown Milwaukee steam utility, and a decrease of approximately $100,000 or a little less than 0.5% for our Milwaukee County steam operations. All of these rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2010. ", "In addition, the Commission lowered the return on equity for Wisconsin Electric from 10.75% to 10.4% and for Wisconsin Gas from 10.75% to 10.5%. The capital structure of the utilities remains unchanged. The authorized common equity range for Wisconsin Electric is 48.5% to 53.5%, and for Wisconsin Gas, the equity range is 45% to 50%. ", "In Michigan, on December 16 the Public Service Commission there approved our modified self-implementation plan, to raise electric rates in the state of Michigan by approximately $12 million or 9.5%, effective with the commercial operation of Unit 1 at the Oak Creek expansion. This rate increase is subject to refund with interest, depending upon the Michigan Commission\u2019s final decision on the company\u2019s $42 million annual rate request. We expect the Commission to issue its final order in July of this year. ", "Last, but certainly not the least, in January our Board of Directors approved an increase in the annual dividend from $1.35 to $1.60 a share. Our dividend policy continues to target a pay out ratio of 40% to 45% of earnings for this year and for 2011, and starting in 2012, we\u2019ll be targeting a 45% to 50% payout ratio. The first quarterly dividend for this year will be payable on March 1 at a rate of $0.40 a share. ", "Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Allen, who will give you more details on our financial performance for 2009. Allen.", "Allen Leverett", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2009 year end earnings from continuing operations were $3.20 a share. I will focus on operating income by segment, and then I\u2019ll touch on other income statement items. I\u2019ll also discuss cash flows for the year, and cover our earnings guidance for 2010. ", "Now, our consolidated operating income in 2009 was $664 million as compared to $659 million in 2008, or a slight increase of $5 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $554 million, a decrease of $27 million versus 2008. ", "As Gale mentioned earlier, our utility operations were hurt by lower sales of electricity. Our Management team worked hard to mitigate the decline in sales with strong cost control measures. Our operating income was approximately $66 million lower, because of a decline in retail electricity sales associated with the economy. In addition, we estimate that weather reduced our operating income by $30 million, primarily driven by the cooler summer. ", "Depreciation expense was $12 million higher in our utility segment. Partially offsetting these unfavorable factors were favorable fuel recoveries of $19 million, reductions in our O&M costs totaling $38 million, and pricing increases totaling $17 million. The O&M reductions came across all areas of our company. We lowered staffing levels, and we reduced other controllable areas of spending. The net of these items, plus another $7 million in favorable variances brings us to the $27 million reduction in utility operating income. ", "Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which primarily includes We Power, was up $31 million. The key drivers of this increase were a full year\u2019s earnings contribution from Unit 2 at Port Washington, which was placed into service in May of 2008, and earnings from the water in-take system at Oak Creek, which was placed into service in January 2009. ", "Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $10 million in 2009, compared to an operating loss of $11 million in 2008. In the future, we project to have only slight operating losses in this area, as we will have minimal business operations in this segment. Taking the changes for each of these segments brings you back to the $5 million increase in operating income for 2009.", "During 2009, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased by almost $7 million. Our total earnings from American Transmission Company were $59 million in 2009. Other income increased by $11 million primarily because of increased AFUDC and large utility construction projects, including the air quality control systems at our existing Oak Creek Plants.", "Net interest expense increased almost $3 million. Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $1 million because of higher pretax earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2009 was 36.6% compared to 37.7% in 2008.", "This decline was primarily a result of a greater level of wind and production tax credits. I expect that our effective tax rate in 2010 will be between 35% and 36%. Combining all of these items brings you to $377 million of net income from continuing operations for 2009 or earnings of $3.20 per share.", "During 2009, we generated $629 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is down $108 million from the same period in 2008. Now as we discussed on prior conference calls, during 2009, we contributed $289 million to our benefit trust, which is approximately $241 million greater than 2008.", "On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $821 million. The adjusted number includes the $192 million of cash impacts from the Point Beach bill credits. Now under GAAP, the cash from the bill credits is reflected as a change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity, but from a management standpoint, we consider this as a source of cash as it directly relates to the bill credits.", "Our total capital expenditures were approximately $818 million in 2009 about $550.1 million of this was dedicated to our utility business and $251 million was for the generating units being constructed as part of our Power the Future plan. This year, our total capital budget is approximately $950 million, $815 million of this is in our utility operations and about $135 million is for our Power the Future program.", "Of the $815 million in utility spending, nearly $100 million is for renewables and $300 million is for environmental related upgrades at our Power Plants. We also paid $158 million in common dividends in 2009 and we expect to pay $187 million in 2010. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-capital ratio was 58.1% as of December 31 and we were at 55.2% on an adjusted basis.", "These ratios are slightly better than our December 31, 2008 levels. The adjusted amount treats half of our $500 million in hybrid securities as common equity, which is the approach used by the majority of the rating agencies. Our goal is to maintain our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at no more than 60% during the period we\u2019re constructing our new coal fired generation.", "We were using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Given the contribution that we made to our pension trust in 2009 and the trust returns of 15% in 2009, our pension plan was nearly fully funded at year end. So we do not plan on making a contribution to the pension trust this year.", "Going forward, we are assuming long term asset returns of 7.25%. I expect that our pension expense will be about $47 million this year as compared to $21 million in 2009. However, the increased pension expense was considered when our rates were set. Now, as shown in the earnings package we posted on our website this morning, our actual 2009 retail sales of electricity declined 8.1% as compared to sales in 2008.", "On a weather normalized basis, 2009 retail electric sales declined 7.1%. This is somewhat better than the 8.5% weather normalized decline we had forecast back in October of last year. Looking to 2010, we are forecasting essentially flat sales of electricity versus normalized 2009 levels.", "Underlying this flat overall sales outlook is a slight up tick in large commercial and industrial sales and some additional decline in sales to small commercial customers. We expect sales to residential customers to be flat on a weather normalized basis, and I\u2019d add that the commercial and industrial sales outlook is consistent with the one included for purposes of rate making in our Wisconsin retail rate case last year.", "In December of last year, Wisconsin Electric issued $250 million of unsecured notes. The notes have a 4.25% coupon rate and a 10 year maturity. Looking to this year, we expect to complete the permanent debt financings for the two new units at Oak Creek. We also expect to reissue the $147 million of tax exempt bonds at the Wisconsin Electric level that we repurchased last year pending more favorable tax exempt rates.", "Also, we may do a Wisconsin Electric debt offering late this year. On a consolidated basis, we have approximately $1.6 billion of available undrawn credit facilities that expire in March and April of 2011. Now we anticipate renewing and resizing our credit facilities later this year. Our earnings guidance range remains the same as what we provided to you in December.", "We expect our earnings in 2010 to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share. Underlying this range was the assumption that the first unit at Oak Creek would go into service in mid-January and that the second unit would be placed into service at the end of August. The schedule for unit one slipped by a couple of weeks, but we\u2019re still comfortable with our guidance range of $3.65 to $3.75 per share.", "Just for reference, we estimate that a one month move in the in service date for unit two would change earnings by about $0.02 per share. The earnings contribution from our utility segment, which includes Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, was $2.53 per share in 2009. Average rate base for the combined utilities was about $5.3 billion in 2009, and we essentially earned our allowed rate of return on equity of 10.75% in 2009. ", "Now looking to this year, combined rate base is expected to grow to $5.8 billion. However, we believe that our earned rate of return on equity will be about 10% in 2010. This would reduce the earnings contribution of the utility segment to $2.51 per share in 2010. Three key items are expected to drive the roughly 40 basis point differential between the 10.4% allowed return on equity and the projected 10% earned return on equity.", "The first is electric fuel recovery. We currently estimate we\u2019ll under recover our fuel cost by between $10 million and $15 million this year. Next is the timing of rate recovery in Michigan. We did receive an interim increase there that we are implementing in conjunction with the commercial operation of unit one at Oak Creek. However, we do not expect our full request to be acted on until the middle of this year.", "Finally, although the Wisconsin Commission accepted our electric sales forecast for the commercial and industrial classes, they did not reflect our residential forecast when they set rates. On weather normalized basis, our outlook for residential sales in 2010 is flat. The Commission assumed that residential sales would grow by 1.6%.", "Of course, actual costs and sales will impact our return, but at this point our best estimate is about a 10% earned return on equity for the utilities segment in 2010. We expect the earnings contribution from our investment in the American Transmission Company to grow from $0.30 per share in 2009 to $0.32 per share this year.", "Moving to We Power, which includes the units at Port Washington as well as units in Oak Creek we expect the earnings contribution from We Power to increase from $0.42 per share in 2009 to $1.04 per share this year. Note that in order to be consistent with a basis for presentation we\u2019ve used in the past, this includes an allocation of holding company interest to We Power and does not include any impact of capitalized interest.", "Finally, moving to the holding company, we expect that the earnings reduction from unallocated holding company debt will increase from $0.05 to $0.17 per share. This is being driven by the fact that as the units at Oak Creek go into service, we will not be able to capitalize as much interest in 2010 as we did in 2009.", "So to review, starting from the $3.20 per share that we earned in 2009, utility earnings were expected to decline $0.02 per share, which is offset by $0.02 per share increase at ATC. We expect We Power to add $0.62 per share and holding company interest to reduce earnings $0.12 per share. Adding these changes together brings you from the actual base of earnings of $3.20 per share in 2009 to $3.70 of share, which is the midpoint of our guidance range for this year.", "I would also like to provide some input on our expectations for earnings in the first quarter. The earnings contribution from We Power is expected to be higher now that Unit 1 at Oak Creek is in service. However, our utility earnings will be impacted by weather and fuel recoveries.", "In the first quarter of 2009, we had cold weather as well as $28 million in favorable electric fuel recoveries. Weather in the first quarter is uncertain, but we project that the swing in fuel recoveries alone will result in $0.15 to $0.17 per share reduction in earnings in the first quarter of 2010 as compared to the first quarter of 2009.", "As a result, we would expect first quarter 2010 earnings to be below first quarter 2009 earnings. However, our annual earnings guidance range for 2010 is $3.65 to $3.75 per share, which represents a significant amount of growth as compared to our $3.20 per share result in 2009.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Allen, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. I think we\u2019re now waiting for the operator to move into the question-and-answer session.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Securities.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Securities", "I didn\u2019t hear, when you mention about the \u201811 outlook. I was wondering if you still endorse the $4 number that\u2019s out there.", "Gale Klappa", "I think we\u2019ve said over the last few months that conceptually our aspiration would be roughly $4 a share in earnings for 2011, and right now we don\u2019t see anything that would change that aspiration.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Securities", "Any update on potential legislation to get rid of this pesky fuel over or under recovery that plagued us every quarter?", "Gale Klappa", "In fact a bill is in the legislature right now. The bill passed unanimously in an assembly committee, the relevant assembly committee that has jurisdiction over this type of thing, passed just really within the last two weeks. The bill is now awaiting a floor vote in the assembly. I think the only question we would have is whether or not the legislature, given its calendar, whether the Senate would have time to act on the bill. So it\u2019s moving. It\u2019s moving at a Glacier pace, but there\u2019s an appropriate change now being considered by the legislature.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Securities", "You can just review what the bill would do?", "Gale Klappa", "Essentially, what the bill would be to set a fuel baseline, each utility in the State of Wisconsin would project its fuel costs for the upcoming year, and it would file that projection with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission in the fall of the prior year. So let\u2019s say for example, if the bill were in effect now, this coming fall we would file our expected fuel cost for the year 2011.", "The Commission would then set a fuel rate, the Commission would have a mini hearing, would set a fuel rate beginning January 1 of 2011, which would obviously significantly reduce the lag if we were under recovering and would also reduce any over recovery and would make it much, much more streamlined for there to eliminate these wild swings of fuel under and over recovery.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Leslie Rich - Columbia Management.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "On the Glacier Hills project, could you refresh my memory and tell me what the procedural schedule is at this point now that you have the Certificate of Public Convenience?", "Gale Klappa", "Actually, there\u2019s no more procedural schedule left at the Commission. That was the key vote and we\u2019re now moving toward basically to begin fieldwork.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "So then the timing, do you have to get sitting done?", "Gale Klappa", "No. It\u2019s all done. We have all of the arrangements we need and we have the final approval from the Wisconsin Commission. Rick.", "Rick Kuester", "Yes, the only thing we need to do is work out based on some guidelines the Commission gave us we need to work out the final turbine sitting and we would expect to do that in the next couple of months, a little bit of work to do with landowners there, but we\u2019ve got all of our permits and we\u2019re ready to go in the field and we do foundations this year, and erection next year and the first full year of commercial operation would be 2012.", "Leslie Rich - Columbia Management", "So when do you think you\u2019ll nail down what the scope of the project is in terms of size and CapEx?", "Rick Kuester", "We said up to 90 turbines, my guess is we\u2019ll be between 80 and 90 at the end of the day, and we will nail that down, I would think, by mid March.", "Allen Leverett", "Leslie, this is Allen. What we\u2019ve assumed sort of in our base financial plan is about a $367 million investment. So roughly in the middle of the range that Gale talked about.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "In the rate case filing, you had to disclose I think what your planned CapEx for WEPCO and Wisconsin Gas would be for 2011 as well, if I remember correctly. Can you refresh our memories in terms of what you filed in that case kind of the level of CapEx expected at those two subs in that year?", "Gale Klappa", "We are going back through our luminous pages that we have in here to give you a more precise number.", "Allen Leverett", "I guess if you talk about it for the regulated business in total, so I think you\u2019re interested in 2011, Michael. I would say for the regulated business in total, it\u2019s about $1 billion.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Outside of the regulated business besides maintenance CapEx on Oak Creek, what do you expect to have left in Port Washington?", "Allen Leverett", "There\u2019s only about I would say in the range of $10 million to $15 million in what I would call Power the Future. So essentially all of the spending that we would be looking at in 2011 is at the regulated entities and it\u2019s about $1 billion.", "Gale Klappa", "Michael, what\u2019s driving that number is 2011 will be our peak year of spending. This year and next will be our peak year of spending on those major air quality upgrades that we talked about at the existing Oak Creek units and remember that\u2019s a $960 million-ish project. It\u2019s a very large project.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "How much of that have you done today or as of the end of 2009?", "Gale Klappa", "Rick and I were just looking at those numbers, the total project, including engineering, procurement, and construction, Rick, roughly 25%?", "Rick Kuester", "I\u2019d say about 20% construction completed right now, probably construction complete around 60% by the end of this year.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "O&M, how recurring or how sustainable do you view the O&M cost savings, which you\u2019ve realized during this year?", "Gale Klappa", "Let me frame the answer, and then Allen can give you some precise numbers, but the honest answer is some of the cost savings we achieved in 2009 will never come back because they\u2019re permanent productivity gains. However, having said that, we are going to see an increase in operation and maintenance expenses in 2010 compared to 2009 because we have a very different company this year.", "With this morning with the commercial operation of the first expansion unit at Oak Creek, we\u2019re going to be purchasing ammonia. We\u2019re going to be purchasing limestone. We have staffing of 180 full time people to operate the unit. So we have significant cost increases coming from the operation of the new investments. Allen.", "Allen Leverett", "Just to maybe put numbers around that, Michael. I mean if you look at those in our generation business and you look at the increase in O&M, that\u2019s about a $50 million increase in O&M and that was reflected in the Wisconsin case and we also have about a $38 million projected increase in benefit cost, and that was also reflected in Wisconsin rate making.", "So that\u2019s being driven by earning below the actuarially assumed rates of return in past years, so back in 2008 and then lowering the expected return on assets going forward. So as Gale mentioned, there were a couple of new items that are increasing O&M, but that was built into rates in Wisconsin and we\u2019re seeking to build all that into rates in Michigan as we go through that process.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Appicelli - Morgan Stanley.", "Bill Appicelli - Morgan Stanley", "Just quickly on the legislation you are discussing earlier about the potential changes to the RPS in Wisconsin, how do you view that and how does that impact your ability to invest in renewables over the next three to five years?", "Gale Klappa", "In terms of the next three to five years, I don\u2019t see a lot of change from the legislation, and the reason I don\u2019t is obviously we are putting in place in our pipeline our plan to get to the current 2015 standard. The big change would be going from 10% renewables in 2015 to 25% renewables by 2025.", "That\u2019s a very sizable leap, if you will, and would require significant additional investment in several types of renewables, plus probably some purchase power agreements with wind developers. So if anything, the center piece of the legislation, which is a strong goal of this governor\u2019s which is 25/25 would it in essence enhance our investment opportunity post 20/15.", "Bill Appicelli - Morgan Stanley", "Where do things stand in terms of the legislative process with this right now?", "Gale Klappa", "As I mentioned to you, this is a large, fairly complicated bill. It was just introduced a month or so ago. The first hearing in the first committee was held last Thursday, and there will have to be hearings in both houses of the legislature. The first hearing, as I said, was just held last Thursday. I\u2019m not sure if the second hearing date has actually been established yet. They were hoping to get hearings done by the end of February.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Reza Hatefi - Decade Capital.", "Reza Hatefi - Decade Capital", "", "A couple of clarification questions, Allen, you mentioned CapEx for 2011 is $1 billion. I think you said 2010 is $815 million. Can you give us 2012 CapEx?", "Allen Leverett", "In terms of 2010, remember the total would be about $951 million and so roughly $815 million of that would be in the regulated business and the rest would be Power the Future and if you look to 2011, about $1 billion in the regulated business, another $15 million outside for about $1.015 billion, and I think your question then goes to 2012. I would say that the regulated business expenditures probably in the neighborhood of $800 million, depending on what happens with some of these renewable projects down the road, and something in the neighborhood of $25 million outside, so call it around $830 million in 2012 in total.", "Reza Hatefi - Decade Capital", "Yes, it does and these gross CapEx numbers, do those include your portion of ATC CapEx or not?", "Allen Leverett", "No, so to the extent that we would make and of course any capital contributions, that would be equity that we would invest in ATC, they\u2019re able to raise debt at their own level. So I would imagine that we would make some small capital contributions to ATC, but their cash flow is so strong at their level and their ability to raise debt given the combination of strong internal cash flow and their ability to raise debt, I really see very little going in terms of incremental capital contributions to ATC over the next couple years.", "Reza Hatefi - Decade Capital", "What is your expected pro rata portion of ATC rate base in 2010?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, we own about a quarter of the company. I think we own precisely 26.2% of the company. I believe that their capital budget this year is around $400 million. So they have a little bit of appreciation, but in effect that would be like a $100 million worth of rate base growth, but they have a little bit of depreciation right now.", "Reza Hatefi - Decade Capital", "What is the overall rate base of ATC right now?", "Allen Leverett", "I would say it\u2019s probably in the neighborhood of $2.2 billion.", "Reza Hatefi - Decade Capital", "So you own about 26% or so of that roughly speaking?", "Allen Leverett", "That\u2019s right.", "", "Reza Hatefi - Decade Capital", "Then you mentioned some rate base figures earlier. Could you repeat those and also could you break them down between utilities, whether it\u2019s WEPCO or Wisconsin Gas?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, let me just go back and review those. I talked about the average in 2009, and so that\u2019s about $5.3 billion and that breaks down raise it\u2019s about $750 million at Wisconsin Gas, and the balance would be at Wisconsin Electric, so about $4.6 at Wisconsin Electric and about $750 million at Wisconsin Gas. So that\u2019s your \u201809 average, and then if you look to 2010, you recall I said the total was $5.8 billion. I would see about$800 million of that being at Wisconsin Gas or thereabouts and then the rest or $5 billion being at Wisconsin Electric.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Reza. One of the things that Allen is pointing to as he went through the capital spending numbers over the course of the next few years, and I\u2019m not sure everyone has recognized, is the significant additional investment that we\u2019ll be making both in the air quality controls at the existing Oak Creek units and in the renewable projects we need to meet the state mandate and that will give us a very significant additional leg of growth post the Power the Future plan, and I just wanted to remind everyone of that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "", "Just wanted to flush out the comment on 1.5% customer growth could you just give us a little bit of insight on where you\u2019re seeing growth and how that\u2019s breaking out by customer class?", "Gale Klappa", "Nathan, I hope we didn\u2019t mislead you. We really were not talking about 1.5% customer growth. What we were really talking about is if you look at actual electric sales to retail customers in 2009 and then you say, well weather normalized, what we expect for 2010, it\u2019s really 1% to 1.5% growth.", "In terms of customer growth, we grew about three tense of 1% in the number of customers we\u2019re serving during 2009, and actually while that sounds like very small growth and it is, compared to what we\u2019ve historically seen, which has been about 1% to 1.25% customer growth as you know many utilities actually had their customer base shrink in 2009 and I think the fact that our customer base continued to grow, albeit slowly, is another significant sign of the relative strength of the Wisconsin economy.", "The economy here has been hurt like every other state, but unemployment is better than the national average. Certainly housing delinquencies have held up better than the national average. Delinquency rates are better than the national average, and we\u2019re continuing to see some modest customer growth and a lot of that customer growth came from residential very little industrial growth obviously during the recession, small bit of commercial growth, but of the 0.3% of growth in the number of customers, most of that came from the residential side.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "So to clarify then, you were specifically speaking about usage of 1.5% growths and\u2026?", "Gale Klappa", "1% to 1.5%.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "If you were to break that down, some clarity on where that\u2019s coming from?", "Allen Leverett", "Nathan, on page 12 of the earnings release package.", "Gale Klappa", "We\u2019ve got it all broken down for you, but if you don\u2019t have that in front of you, forecast 2010 versus actual 2009 and again that\u2019s, just to be completely clear, forecast 2010 sales versus actual \u201809, we would see about a 4% growth in residential, actually a small decline about 2.4% in small commercial and industrial, a 2.1% increase in large commercial and industrial, and then overall retail about 1.2%.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "As a separate question, when you look across the Midwest and perhaps more of the windy areas of the country, were they are removed, but in your area\u2026?", "Gale Klappa", "Nathan, are you including Washington D.C?", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "There\u2019s discussion of difficult times for renewable energy providers, and I guess I\u2019m going to ask the question, would you be interested acquiring any assets instead of building?", "Gale Klappa", "The honest answer is we never say, never and if there was a renewable opportunity that fit into our portfolio and was deliverable in terms of the actual energy supply into the State of Wisconsin, we would certainly look at that, no question about that, but we\u2019re not counting on that.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "Is the environment more susceptible or more advantageous for you to do such a thing, or is it just steady state and that\u2019s really not an option?", "Gale Klappa", "There\u2019s no near term option that we\u2019re aware of at the moment that we haven\u2019t looked at and found some flaw with. So I would say at the moment steady state, but we\u2019re always on the lookout for an appropriate opportunity.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities", "Then just finally, clearly the EPA is talking about a lot of various proposed rules this year and over the next several years. Just generally, do you have a view on what\u2019s going to happen at the EPA and what\u2019s coming out? Also is there any additional current resisting generation that you have that potentially could be at risk that may need to be replaced?", "Gale Klappa", "In terms of my view of the EPA and what they might be doing next, I was in a session about three our four weeks ago, both Rick Kuester and I were in a session three or four weeks ago with Lisa Jackson, who is the current Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and right now, one of her main areas of focus obviously is getting proposed regulations out the door which would follow on the EPA\u2019s decision to determine that CO2 is a harmful pollutant.", "Now these would take the form of proposed regulations. They would be open for comment, and I think she and everyone else believes that these proposed regulations once they would go through the comment period and become effective are headed for a very long court challenge. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any question about that.", "So on the regulatory front I think we will see some action. The real key is what would, EPA determine is the best available control technology for a fossil fueled plant that obviously emits CO2, since there is no widely acceptable or commercially widely available technology for CO2 capture today and she seems very cognizant of that problem and that issue. So it will be very interesting to see how the regulations unfold, but regardless of how they unfold, I think the industry and the EPA and other industries are in for a very long court fight.", "Rick Kuester", "One other thing I might just add is we\u2019re in pretty good shape. We proactively approached EPA back in 2002 and signed a consent decree and we\u2019ve been installing air quality control equipment on our units, Pleasant Prairie, now South Oak Creek, we retired old units in Port Washington and put gas fired units. So I would say overall as far as our fleet for non-CO2, for example SO2 or NOx, we are in pretty good shape. I think we\u2019re somewhat ahead of the curve.", "Gale Klappa", "Rick is making a very good point. If you look at 2010, which would be the end of our major Power the Future construction and the units that we have in place and operating this year, and you dial the clock back to the early 2000s, we will have reduced the traditional pollutants, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury. We will have reduced those pollutants by more than 65% on our system. So we are in very good shape in terms of the traditional pollutants, and I think that would mean certainly for the foreseeable future we don\u2019t have any significant units at risk.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "I have a couple questions. First related to the Oak Creek unit and the testing you did there and so forth. Given that, where do you expect that plant to fall in the dispatch curve of the region? Will it be like top decile, top quartile, how should we think about that?", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ve measured exactly whether it\u2019s top decile or top quartile, but even with the downturn in the economy and lower energy usage across the Midwest, certainly this unit will dispatch way more than 50% of the time even in the early going. So it really will be one of the more efficient contributors in MISO and that means, as you know, Dan, that it will be displacing less cost effective energy and in many cases energy that brings with it more pollution than this unit, which is going to be one of the cleanest coal fired power plants anywhere in the world.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Related to that, have you projected or do you expect anymore wholesale or sale for resale in 2010 given the new plants that you have?", "Rick Kuester", "We have some internal objectives to basically add to our wholesale power business, both on a shorter term and longer term basis. So I think there will be some opportunity to add to our wholesale power customer base, if you will, and we\u2019re actively pursuing that.", "Allen Leverett", "Our fuel case submitted last year, the Commission has opportunity sales and reflecting additional energy available out of those units. So we\u2019re looking at basically deals that we can sign for a little bit longer term if the market is there, but obviously there are opportunities for sales in MISO that are baked into the forecast.", "Gale Klappa", "Dan, to that point, it\u2019s not just Oak Creek. Our new units at Port Washington, those combined cycle gas units we have there are about as efficient, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a more efficient combined cycle gas unit in the Midwest.", "Rick Kuester", "It\u2019s among the most.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "I was wondering if you could give a little more color on your sales forecast, why you think that the small commercial industrial will continue to decline whereas the large is expected to pick up, are you seeing anything in particular there that\u2019s driving that forecast?", "Allen Leverett", "Dan, this is Allen. Let me just sort of briefly talk about residential, commercial, and industrial. We talked about a flat outlook for residential. So flat is in weather normalized terms. So you weather normalize 2009 and then you look at 2010 forecast, so the key driver that we see for residential is Wisconsin housing stock and we\u2019re assuming that there will be essentially no growth in Wisconsin housing stock in 2010 as compared to 2009.", "So that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the flat weather normalized outlook for residential. If you look at commercial, really what we see as being the key forecast driver for commercial sales is the level of employment, absolute level of employment, and we really believe that employment in 2010 is going to be even below 2009 levels.", "We think employment is going to decline about another 1.5%. So that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our forecast for commercial and then finally on industrial, we believe there\u2019s going to be about a 2% increase in the U.S. industrial production output index and so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving our roughly 2% increase in sales to large commercial and industrial. ", "", "Gale Klappa", "Dan, that includes the furlough time that the governor is expecting you to take.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Yes, I\u2019m well aware of that. Finally, I was kind of curious on the 3.3% rate increase for the electric, is that in addition to the bill credits running off from the nuclear plant sales, so will the actual increase be larger? How does that work out?", "Gale Klappa", "The calculation of the bill credits is completely separate from that number. So basically if you take the actual rates that were in effect in \u201809 and add 3.5%, that is what we were saying the calculation is. Then obviously, the remaining bill credits are then applied to the customer\u2019s bill from there.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "How much of those bill credits still are left to distribute?", "Alan Leverett", "I would say about $190 million is left.", "Gale Klappa", "Somewhere between $180 million, and $190 million.", "Alan Leverett", "Those are essentially all Wisconsin jurisdictional. There was about $2 million worth of credits that we gave in Michigan in January. The FERC is done, and then the FERC jurisdiction all is done and all the rest go to Wisconsin customers.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So then that will pretty much run out at the end of 2010, will it be completed?", "Gale Klappa", "Assuming that energy sales come in at about our forecast, then all of the bill credits would run out, yes, at the end of 2010.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So how does that original, what was it, 17% increase get implemented then? Is there an increase still set to be put in place related to that or how does that work?", "Gale Klappa", "Again, it can be somewhat confusing, but if you look at the actual rate that\u2019s in place, the full amount that you\u2019re talking about is now baked into the rates. The customer will feel some more of that increase as the bill credits roll down.", "Alan Leverett", "There\u2019s not an additional regulatory action that has to occur.", "Gale Klappa", "Exactly.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So the customer impact will probably be higher than the 3.3%, because the bill credits will be less this year? Is that what you\u2019re saying?", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re exactly right, and we would call that the bill impact as opposed to the actual rate calculation, but the bill impact will be greater than the 335, but again, that\u2019s because of the slightly smaller Point Beach bill credits this year that then fully roll off by the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "I had this question keyed up to say you hadn\u2019t talked about Point Beach, in a while, but here you talked about it with Jay and just the question before me, but separate question on it. I know FPL is planning an up rate outage, which will be a bit longer than a normal refueling outage. I was wondering if you could remind us, how that will impact you from a cost perspective, thinking about it in the context of a fuel and purchase power recovery as it stands now and then what it may change under the legislation?", "Gale Klappa", "The short answer is, under our contract with FPL, they have the right to replace that energy, if they wish to go out in the wholesale market and buy it. Given the wholesale prices in the MISO market, that\u2019s exactly what FPL did this year. If you look at where wholesale prices are in the MISO market, they may well do that again, but I would say this, our anticipation of what may occur is already baked into our forecast.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "You\u2019ve baked in they just recently delayed that from \u201810 to \u201811. So that\u2019s sort of reflective and I guess it really doesn\u2019t impact you so long as you assume they replace that power?", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct. Or that we could go out and replace it at what we project the rates to be, either way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Securities.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Securities", "You talked about your attracted capital opportunities. How do you think about financing those with your dividend aspirations?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, our financing plan is designed essentially to be able to move forward with the capital expenditures and the capital projects that we\u2019ve described to you and with the dividend payout ratio that we\u2019ve also described to you. So we worked very hard to put the pieces of the puzzle together to make this work in a way that we would have a very minimal net increase in debt compared to total capital and no need to issue any additional equity. Alan.", "Alan Leverett", "No, I wouldn\u2019t add anything. That\u2019s a very good qualitative description of what we\u2019re trying to carry out.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc Securities", "What should we look at rate kind of base trajectory until 2015 to look like?", "Alan Leverett", "Well, I mean we\u2019re looking at, when we talked about earlier in the questions, we talked about $800 million worth of regulated CapEx this year, and we talked about $1 billion in 2011. I believe depreciation is about $300 million at the utilities. So that would be $600 million of depreciation over two years, $1.8 billion of capital. So that would be another $1.2 billion of rate base on top of the $5.8 billion that we\u2019ve got today. So I mean that sort of gives you a general feel over the next two years, but the spending, Paul, obviously very, very heavy the next two years.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "How do you think about your sensitivity to every percentage change in demand?", "Gale Klappa", "Alan has a precise answer for you, Michael.", "Alan Leverett", "Michael, it might be useful, if you have the earnings package, turn to page 12. So what we\u2019re saying, our 2010 forecast level of sales versus 2009 normalized, you see we\u2019re saying about a minus 0.4%. So let\u2019s just assume to take your hypothetical if instead of minus 0.4% let\u2019s say we grow six-tenths of %, so a full percentage point better than our forecast.", "Just assume that just goes equally across the classes, a one third. So we would be looking at about a $16 million improvement in pre-tax margins for that 1% move. Now Michael, half of that would come from residential, because that\u2019s higher margin obviously, and then about $6 million would be from commercial and then $2 million from industrial, so that gives you the $16 million pre-tax margin. Does that help?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Last thing, when you look around at your neighbors and look around just in the state and what is likely to be environmental policy coming out of Uncle Sam, who knows when, two, three, five years not really for carbon, but for SOX and mercury, how much of an impact for the state do you expect to see in terms of coal plant retirements?", "Gale Klappa", "The Wisconsin Commission has a docket opened right now, where each of the utilities is supposed to submit data on potential future requirements of fossil fuel plants. I can\u2019t really speak for Alliance, but I can speak or WPS, but I can speak for us, and Rick actually alluded to this point earlier. We are very far ahead of the curve on the traditional pollutants, given the modern advanced emission controls that we\u2019re putting in place.", "Remember we just did a huge upgrade that we completed a couple of years ago at our Pleasant Prairie plant, which is a very large coal fire powered plant that came online in 1984, and that now has all of the moderate emission controls. The existing Oak Creek units will have all of the modern emission controls online by 2012, by the end of 2012. Obviously the new Oak Creek units are in great shape. So from our standpoint of our base load coal fleets, we\u2019re in very good shape.", "Rick Kuester", "I might add we\u2019ve retired coal units over the last few years associated with Power the Future. We\u2019ve just retired two units at Prescott at the end of last year. That brings us to five units up there where we used to have nine units. We retired five units at Port Washington 70 year old coal plant. So again I think we\u2019re a little ahead of the curve in that we retired some of our older units and controlled units where it makes sense to control them.", "Gale Klappa", "I don\u2019t see us having really any significant risk in the next five years.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "When you look at power prices and forward curves in your region, does it make sense for someone who hasn\u2019t already contracted to scrub a plant to actually do so now?", "Gale Klappa", "It depends so much on the heat rate. It depends so much on the condition of the plant, the coal source of the plant, and where that plant sits in terms of its contribution to VAR support and voltage support. The other thing I was mentioning to someone just this morning. It\u2019s easy to sit and think about, well, here is an older plant let\u2019s retire it, but you have to think about what functions does that plant provide on the network.", "For example, we have an older plant, which we call the Valley Plant, which is just south of downtown Milwaukee. Well, that\u2019s an older plant, it burns coal, but, it provides steam to virtually every downtown Milwaukee building. Retiring that would be a real problem. It provides significant voltage support for the downtown Milwaukee demand pocket. So it really is a case-by-case analysis, and as we\u2019ve done our case-by-case analysis, we feel quite good.", "Gale Klappa", "I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ll thank you again for participating.

Thank you for waiting and welcome to Wisconsin Energy Quarterly Conference Call. This conference is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website, a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us as we review the company\u2019s 2010 third quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today.", "We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation, Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer, Jim Fleming, General Counsel, Jeff West, our Treasurer and Steve Dickson, Controller. Allen will review our financial results in detail in just a moment.", "But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.95 a share for the third quarter of 2010. This compares with $0.49 a share from continuing operations in the same period last year.", "Our 2010 third quarter results were boosted by warm humid weather, continuing cost controls and a full quarter of earnings from our investment in the first new generating unit at Oak Creek. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our solid financial performance that we\u2019ve recorded in the third quarter and for the first nine months of this year.", "Our customers clearly responded to the return of summer temperatures in the Midwest. In fact in July, our residential customers used more electricity than during any other month in history. And during the dark days of August, our small commercial and industrial customers used more electric energy than during any other single month in history.", "Now, I would like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power the Future plan is fundamental to the principal of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in tow Combined Cycle Natural Gas Fired units at Port Washington, which is north of Milwaukee. ", "The construction of two super critical pauperized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city, and building a significant amount of renewable generation. We\u2019re now nearing completion of the new coal fired unit at Oak Creek. As you recall, unit one passed all of its performance tests and was placed in the commercial service on February 2 of this year.", "Over the past several months, our general contractor at Oak Creek, Bechtel Power Corporation has focused on completing the commissioning and testing of Unit 2. So, we fire on the coal on the Unit 2 boiler was achieved on July the 8. The Unit 2 generator was then synchronized with the grid for the first time on July 16 and since that time the unit is operated up to and exceeded 100% of its rated capacity. Bechtel recently completed a timed outage and brought Unit 2 back online. The unit is now undergoing final performance testing.", "However, Bechtel is experiencing some equipment issues that may delay completion of the testing. Depending on the revolution, the turnover date for Unit 2 could be delayed a few days or even a few weeks. We still though expect commercial operation of Unit 2 to be a fourth quarter event. As a reminder, the guaranteed turnover date for Unit 2 at Oak Creek, which was set as part of our settlement agreement with Bechtel is November 28.", "Turning now to other recent developments, on May 16, Wisconsin Act 403, was signed in the law by Governor Doyle. This law authorizes the Wisconsin public service commission to develop new rules for recovery of fuel and purchase power cost that are incurred by Wisconsin\u2019s electric utilities. The legislation was designed to streamline the current combustion process for fuel recovery in the States. In short, the law establishes a modified escrow accounting mechanism with an annual crew up for fuel cost.", "On August 31, the commission forwarded a set of new proposed rules to the state legislature where standing committees and each house generally have up to 60 days for review. On October 20, the standing committee in the state ordered to send the new rule back to the commission for modifications. ", "The standing committee in the state assembly is also scheduled to review the rule at a hearing set for November 9. We do not expect any final action from the commission until they receive feedback from both legislative committees. Once the commission responds, the standing committees will then have another 10 days for review. If no action is taken after 10 days, the rule would automatically go into effect. So, as it stands today, we expect the new rules to be in place in 2011.", "Now, I\u2019d like to update you on our progress toward meeting the renewable portfolio standard that the State of Wisconsin has in place for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable resources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level.", "The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, about 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.", "With the completion of our Blue Sky Green Field Wind Farm in 2008, we took a major step towards meeting Wisconsin\u2019s goal of reducing its carbon footprint. Blue Sky Green Field has a total of 88 turbines, each with a capacity of 1.65 megawatts. It was completed under budget and ahead of schedule.", "Also in 2008, we purchased a new wind farm development site, approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. This site, which we call the Glacier Hills Wind Park, has a strong wind resource, close proximity to transmission and low population density making it one of the best locations for a major wind farm in the region.", "On January 22 of this year, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines at the Glacier Hills site. In the second quarter, we finalized an agreement with Vestas Wind Systems for a supply of 90, 1.8 megawatt turbines and we began construction at Glacier Hills. I\u2019m pleased to report that construction is progressing very well, completed all the turbine foundations and all the access roads in preparation for delivery of the turbines themselves which should arrive in mid 2011.", "With 90 turbines, Glacier Hills will have a generating capacity of 162 megawatts. This will make Glacier Hills the largest wind farm to-date in Wisconsin. The first full year of operation is projected to be 2012. Our current estimate of the capital cost of Glacier Hills is approximately $367 million. This estimate does not include any allowance for funds used during construction or any reimbursable transmission costs.", "Now as you may recall, last fall we also announced our plans to build a 50 megawatt cogeneration plant fueled with biomass at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin. The mill is owned and operated by Domtar Corporation. We are fortunate to be close to significant forest lands that are being harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to fuel the plant.", "Now, diversification our renewable energy supply is one of our very important goals. As compared, for examples to wind the clear benefit from an operational standpoint is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. The unit will also supply steam to the Domtar paper mill and of course cogenerating electricity and steam improves the overall efficiency of the unit.", "Our investment in this project is projected to be approximately $255 million without allowance for funds used during construction. On March 15, we filed an application for approval of this project with the Wisconsin Commission. We have now received all the local permits necessary to move forward and the commission is scheduled public and technical hearings for late November and early December. Based on this schedule, we expect the commission to make their decision in the case in early 2011. Our targeted in-service date for the biomass project is late 2013.", "Construction also continues to progress very well on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the existing coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We are investing approximately $950 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas desulphurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities. We expect these controls to be operational in 2012. The project now is about 56% complete, we remain on time and on budget.", "Turning to our Michigan operations, on December 16 of last year, the Michigan Public Service Commission approved our self-implementation plan to raise electric rates by approximately $12 million effective with the commercial operation of Unit 1 at the Oak Creek expansion. Subsequently, the Michigan Commission authorized an additional increase of $11.5 million that was effective on July 2 of this year. The total rate increase $23.5 million annually for our Michigan operations was appealed by one of our industrial customers.", "The Michigan Commission recently ruled on this appeal and accepted several mathematical corrections. These corrections reduce the amount of the increase by $256,000 annually. The adjustment will take effect in just a few days on November 1. ", "Now, I\u2019d like to touch briefly on the direction of the economy in our region. During the summer months, we continue to see a rebound in economic activity across our service area. On previous calls, we mentioned recovery in three large sectors. Iron ore mining, specialty steel and paper production. These sectors remain strong during the third quarter and several other sectors showed real signs of life as well. Most notably, primary metals and metal fabrication, rubber and plastic products, transportation equipment and health care.", "Our third quarter electric sales to our largest customers actually grew by 11% as compared to the third quarter of 2009. But if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales to our largest customers grew by 4% during the quarter and if you normalized for weather, we saw a growth rate of about 1.5%. ", "However, we remain below 2008 levels in sales to our large commercial and industrial customers. And I should add that in September, signs of slowing began to emerge in the phase of the recovery in our region.", "Finally, as Allen and I both mentioned during our public presentations in September, we expect that our board will review our dividend policy at its meeting this December. It\u2019s important to note that the components of our financial goals related to credit ratings and the issuance of new equity will remain the same. ", "The credit rating objective for our utilities remains at the A category and as we said consistently, we do not want to raise our dividend payout to a level that would require us to issue new shares to finance our growth. In the course of our discussions with the board; however we will review the company\u2019s earnings and cash flow projections and we\u2019ll update our outlook for capital spending and other cash requirements such as pension funding.", "As you know, our current policy calls for a 40% to 45% payout ratio next year and then a 45% to 50% payout in 2012 and thereafter. If there are any changes to the policy, I expect it will be announced soon after our board meeting on December 2. And now with more details on our third quarter and the outlook for the remainder of 2010, here is Allen.", "Allen Leverett", "", "Thanks Gale. Now as Gale mentioned earlier, third quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations were 95% per share. I\u2019ll focus on operating income by segment and then touch on other income statement items. I\u2019ll also discuss clash flows for the first nine months and discuss our earnings guidance for the remainder of the year.", "Our consolidated operating income was $203 million as compared to $104 million in the third quarter of 2009 or an increase of $99 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $134 million, which is $60 million higher than the third quarter of 2009. The most significant factor helping our utility earnings was the weather. On a quarter-to-quarter basis, we estimate that weather increased our electric margins by $65 million. This year, we experienced a hot and humid summer, which helped electric margins by approximately $30 million when compared to normal.", "Last summer, we experienced an unseasonably cool summer, which reduced electric margins by approximately $35million. So, when you combine these two variances from normal weather conditions, you get the $65 million year-over-year benefit related to weather.", "As we mentioned earlier in the year, during 2010 we received price increases to cover increased cost. We estimate that these price increases excluding fuel revenues helped operating income by $47 million. Also, our lower depreciation rates contributed to a $16 million reduction in utility depreciation expense. On the negative side, our utility O&M expenses were $56 million higher because of increased amortization cost and cost involved to operate the new plant at Oak Creek.", "These costs were considered in our most recent rate cases. Finally, our fuel recoveries were $12 million unfavorable compared to last year. When we net all of these factors together, we come to utility operating income that was $60 million higher than the third quarter of 2009.", "Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which primarily includes We Power was up $36 million because of the beginning of commercial operation of Unit 1 at Oak Creek on February 2nd. Taking the changes for these two segments and adding $3 million of other items brings you back to the $99 million increase in operating income for this quarter.", "During the third quarter of 2010, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $15 million, which is a slight increase over 2009. All other income of $10 million was level with 2009. Net interest expense increased from $38 million to $53 million for a total of a $15 million increase, primarily because of interest expenses associated with Unit 1 at Oak Creek.", "In February of this year, we issued $530 million in long-term debt to replace short-term debt used to finance the construction of Unit 1. In addition, once Unit 1 achieved commercial operation, we stopped capitalizing interest on the construction in progress. The interest expense on the permanent debt for the Power to Future project is covered by the lease payments, and thus is included in customer rates.", "Consolidated income tax expense increase from $33 million to $63 million for a total increase of $30 million primarily because of higher pre-tax earnings, I except that our annual effective tax rate in 2010 will be in the range of 35% to 36%. ", "Combining all of these items brings you to $112 million of net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2010, our earnings of $0.95 per share. During the first nine months of 2010, we generated $654 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $220 million from the same period in 2009. Last year, our cash flows from operations included a $289 million contribution to our benefit plans. We did not make any contributions in the first nine months of this year.", "On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $786 million as compared to $583 million in the first nine months of 2009. The adjusted number includes $132 million of cash impact from the bill credits in 2010 and $150 million in bill credits and refunds in 2009. These bill credits arose from the gain on the sale of our Point Beach Nuclear plant in 2007. Under GAAP, cash from the bill credits is reflected in the change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From the management standpoint, we consider this a source of cash as it directly relates to customer bill credits.", "The bill credits are scheduled to sunset at the end of this year. At that point, we will have returned the gain on the sale, as well as retained nuclear decommissioning trust assets to our customers. Our total capital expenditures were approximately $546 million in the first nine months of 2010. Approximately $445 million of this was dedicated to our utility business and the balance was primarily related to our new coal units at Oak Creek. ", "We also paid $140 million in common dividends in the first nine months of 2010, which was an 18% increase over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 56.7% as of September 30, 2010 and we were at 53.9% on an adjusted basis. This has improved slightly from our December 31, 2009 levels. I would expect our year end debt to capital ratios just to be somewhat below our December 31, 2009 ratios.", "We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. As shown in the earnings package that was posted in our website this morning, our actual third quarter retail sale of electricity increased 13.8% as compared to 2009. ", "On a weather normalized basis, third quarter retail electric sales increased 1.5%. Excluding the sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines, on a weather normalized basis, retail sales decreased 1.1%, which is slightly behind our third quarter projection that called for a decrease of 0.2%. ", "The normalization process is at best and in perfects science and is less precise in times of extreme weather swings. This year, we had significantly warmer weather and last year we had significantly cooler summer weather. ", "Consumption by our residential customers increased in the third quarter by 26.4% and our small commercial and industrial class increased by 6%, both driven by the hot and humid summer weather.", "We believe that conservation efforts by residential customers contributed to the decline in weather normalized usage in the residential class as compared with our original projections. However, weather-normalized sales to our small commercial and industrial class came in stronger than our projections. Overall, our retail sales excluding the mines are tracking well against forecast.", "In February, we completed the permanent debt financing for the first unit at Oak Creek. Net proceeds were used to repay debt incurred to finance the construction on Unit 1. As we have consistently stated in the past, we anticipate that the permanent debt financing for Unit 2 at Oak Creek will occur upon commercial operation of the unit.", "Given the strong cash flows relative to our financial plan, we do not expect to need any long-term financing in our utilities this year. However, we do expect to complete long-term financing at the utilities in 2011.", "Also on April 1 of next year, we will have a debt maturity at the Wisconsin Energy level. We expect to retire $450 million at 6.5% Notes using internally generated cash and short-term debt at the Wisconsin Energy level.", "On a consolidated basis, we have approximately $1.6 billion of available undrawn credit facilities that expire in March and April of next year. We anticipate renewing and downsizing our credit facilities later this year before they expire in 2011.", "I would now like to discuss our earnings guidance for this year. We are increasing the range for guidance for 2010 by a nickel, from $3.70 to $3.75 per share up to $3.75 to $3.80 per share.", "Let me give you the background for how we arrived at this range. Through the first nine months of the year, we earn $2.78 per share. Now this is $0.14 per share ahead of the plan that we presented to all of you in February. That plan called for $3.70 per share for the year, the midpoint of our original guidance range.", "Now let me step back and give you my view of how I see the fourth quarter shaping up versus our original plan. At this point, I see three factors that are likely to drive us below the original plan earnings for the fourth quarter. ", "The first factor is the timing of the commercial operation at Oak Creek Unit 2. Our original plan called for in service date of October 1, which would have resulted in a full quarter earnings contribution from the unit this year. Of course the commercial and service date for Unit 2 is not certain at this point. However, it is probably safe to say that we will be at least $0.03 to $0.04 per share below the original plan due to this item.", "Next, electric fuel recovery has continued to be a disappointment this year. Assuming we had a $50 million under recovered balance for the year, we would come at about $0.03 per share below the original plan in the fourth quarter.", "Finally, the plan called for normal weather in the fourth quarter. At this point, it appears that October this year will be warmer than normal resulting another $0.01 per share below plan earnings for the fourth quarter.", "Taking these factors together, I would expect that our actual earnings in the fourth quarter will be $0.07 to $0.08 per share below our original plan. Backing this away from the $0.14 per share of favorable performance for the first nine months, we would arrive at an estimate of $0.06 to $0.07 per share of net over performance for the year. When added to the original level of planned earnings for the year that brings you into our new guidance range of $3.75 to $3.80 for 2010. This translates into an earnings guidance range of $0.97 to $1.02 per share for the fourth quarter.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Allen, thank you very much. Overall we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stock holders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operation Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Thanks, good afternoon.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Greg, we got to get one thing straight first as Jed Packer Sunday.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Well, yes, but Jed\u2019s first, Parker second.", "Gale Klappa", "", "How many points you have given me?", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "May the best New York team win. So, I have two quick questions, one is as you look at the political landscape in the state, obviously you may see a shift or you may not in the political party that takes office here. Can you comment on whether you think, there could be at the months full change in the appetite for the renewable energy spending that you\u2019ve been targeting if the Republicans win the governor\u2019s office.", "Gale Klappa", "Very good question, Greg. The race for governor, which I think would be the key race related to future strategy that the State might follow regarding renewable, the race for governor is tight, the last publicly available polls show the Republican slightly ahead, three to five points perhaps and I do think there is a difference of philosophy between the two candidates for governor as it relates to additional renewable portfolio standards beyond the year 2015. ", "So, let me start by saying, regardless of which candidate wins the elections, I don\u2019t believe any of the plans that we have laid out here regarding Glacier Hills or regarding the Biomass project would see any material change.", "We have a state standard in place for 2015, I think everyone expects us to meet that State standard and regardless of which governor or which candidate is in the governor\u2019s match and after January, I don\u2019t see any change in that standard for 2015. The change that might come if for example the Republican wins the race, because it is I think he would probably want us to step back and take our foot of the accelerator and not have a stronger standard for the year 2020 or 2025.", "On the other hand if the Democratic candidate is the Mayor of Milwaukee wins he would express the definite interest in having a renewable portfolio standard at a higher level for the year 2025. So, in essence of the plans we had laid out and that our folks are working on in terms of construction and planning related to the new wind farm at Glacier Hills related to the new Biomass units, I see no impact from the election and we\u2019ll just have to see how things play out regarding any standard for the State beyond 2015. I hope that answers your question, Greg.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "It does, my second question relates to the comment you made on the dividend policy, but really incorporates a bunch of things with regard to cash flow, so you guys have pointed out in PowerPoint presentations from different conference you have been at that is we move for the time and how the future begins to comes into cooperation of cash flow profile of the company improves and that should become more, more free cash flow positive.", "Can you tell us how you feel about whether or not it would be possible to accelerate the dividend payout ratio go over the company, with the back drop of having the deal with pension issues also and maybe the benefits of owner\u2019s depreciation, when you look at the holistic cash flow profile of the company, how possible is that, that you might potentially be able to accelerate the payout ratio trajectory.", "Gale Klappa", "Greg, good question, and we will be basically laying out a base case and then sensitivities around the base case for our Board of Directors in December, Allen is now going through all of our model runs, updating all of our projections and we will actually cover that information with the board first and then if you would like, with you second.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Fair enough, I can try, right?", "Gale Klappa", "You can give it a shot Greg.

I would expect then in the 2012, 2013 timeframe, we would go through the process with the commission, probably sometimes for competitive RFP and then we would look for construction timeframe in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe to get the units aligned by, the beginning of 2016.

Whereas this year, you know coming off with a very large pension contribution to the trust that we made in 2009. Coming off of that, we didn\u2019t make any contributions at all to either the [Inaudible] trust or the pension trust in 2010. ", "I would expect that we would make a contribution to both of those, and candidly we are still finalizing those numbers and there will be somewhat impacted by what the final liability account rate turns out to be for the year. So that\u2019s certainly one thing that will be new in 2011 as opposed to 2010.

So, we don\u2019t stay there in 2016 and therefore we need to really get offence of what the state policy will be asking us to accomplish because we can achieve and then have the plan in place to achieve 2015, but if you have any growth in sales at all and then by using up the bank to get there in 2015, we immediately become short in 2016 and shorter each year going out.

I understand exactly why you are asking the question, it\u2019s a good question. But for example, if it\u2019s determined that we need to continue to stay at say 10% state wide post 2015, then Rick and his team would have to get moving as he mentioned earlier on some projects and looking around for what the additional projects we might put in the pipeline, then I could see as for example as we self build, beginning construction, if we had the need of the continuing standard in 2012.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Okay, great and than just lastly, have the 2012 financial outlook drivers have, they remain consistent since your last update?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, mainly the little earnings model paid by and that we include in our presentation.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Correct.", "Allen Leverett", "That\u2019s unchanged.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "You are welcome.

My question I think is just kind of follow-on, a clarification of your answer to Greg Gordon, just though I\u2019ll think about, that we think right now kind of given them the general variables and kind of in your base plan and readjusting dividend if we look from 12 through like 13, 14 and 15 roughly, in aggregate would you be able to say that operating cash flows would cover both dividend and capital requirement over that period, your basically cash flow neutral cumulatively over that period?", "Allen Leverett", "Well Vedula what we have said about our cash flow picture based on the plan that we laid out to our Board in February of this year, is that we would expect funds from operations to reach across over point versus the sum of dividends and capital spending meaning FFO would be greater than the sum of common dividends and CapEx in either 2012 or 2013. And so part of what we\u2019ll do in the exercise that we will go through with the Board later this fall in December is the update that, but based upon the plan we laid out in February that cross over point was in 2012 or 2013.", "Vedula Murti - CDP", "And besides from the variability of renewable standards post 2015 is that the biggest moving piece that can effect that or was there or what are the other major pieces you focused on?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, that\u2019s certainly a big piece but yeah, the environmental spending. Anyhow, as we\u2019ve said in our public presentations, they\u2019re certainly. Although, we are ahead of the curve versus other utilities on that spending, there would be some potential spending in front of us depending upon where those things, where those rules go. So, environmental is certainly one that I would put on the list, another that I put on the list is pension and I alluded to that in my response to Michael\u2019s question.", "And then the last would be and there would be others, but the other big one would be could there be some additional opportunities outside the footprint at ATC that would require investment.

Are you actually seeing evidence that people are closing up shop and going away for the summer or what is that we\u2019re seeing that would give you any indication that\u2019s a realistic number or it just statistic noise\u2026 ?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, and Allen will give you his view as well. One of the things that, I think we\u2019ve all learned over the years is that weather normalization technique that virtually everyone in the industry uses has its limitations particularly at the extremes. If you think about the summer we had last year, which is really no summer, there was almost no demand for air conditioning at all because of just extremely cool temperatures in the third quarter of \u201909. And then you flip the third quarter of 2010 and we have literally the warmest summer on record in the Milwaukee region. ", "I think you begin to really see that the inherence difficulty with weather normalization at the extremes. So, I wouldn\u2019t place too much emphasis on the third quarter number. However, Allen can tell you what, our nine months weather normalization numbers look like and I would put a lot more credence in the first nine months just on the weather normalization technique for Q3. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "But maybe before I mention that, maybe also put some numbers around the excursion on cooling-degree days, I mean, it was in third quarter 2010, was 115% warmer than the same period in 2009 and about 42% warmer than normal. So it was very significant in terms of the cooling-degree days.", "If you look Nathan at the quarterly weather normalization, that was about weather normalized, we were down the roughly 4% number that you mentioned. If instead you try to normalize the first nine months of 2010 versus the same period of 2009, you get a weather normalized decline of between 2.1% and 2.3%. You can see, when you look at longer periods of time and not quite as much of an excursion, it would indicate a lower weather normalized decline here. ", "Gale Klappa", "And Nathan, we are seeing, what we call the shoulder marks where there is really not a very strong requirement for air conditioning or heating. We are definitely seeing a conservation where its easier to conserve. We have not seen so far when it\u2019s very sticky and very warm. ", "We haven\u2019t seen a significant amount of additional conservation and when it\u2019s very cold, we haven\u2019t seen a significant amount of additional conservation. But in those shoulder months, like for example this month, where we have had warmer than normal temperatures, you can definitely see a fall off. So, I think that\u2019s where we are beginning to see the most impact from customer conservation.", "Nathan Judge \u2013 Atlantic Equity", "So, thinking longer term, there is kind of two questions that follow on to that then, are you \u2013 as it pertains to the coupling and thinking of that as well as what kind of impacts are we talking about to rate the customers, also considering that rates for renewables have to start coming into the customers\u2019 bills, probably in the 2011 plus period. What are we looking at if we continue to see this couple of percent decline annually?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, first of all, we have in our short, medium and longer term forecasting, we have factored in already an element of conservation. What we have seen so far, as Allen said in his remarks, in essence if you look overall across all of our retail customer groups, we are basically tracking pretty darn well against the forecast. We haven\u2019t seen anything alarming or anything that would say that there our forecasting is off base, in terms of the very modest decline that we are seeing on a per customer basis, particularly on the residential side.", "Now having said that, we also continue to see modest customer growth, we were serving several thousand more customers at the end of September this year than at the end of September last year. We are actually seeing an up tick in gas distribution customers as well. So, you are going to see some conservation, you are going to see, I hope continued customer growth and then if we get any kind of economic rebound from here, remember our industrial sales are below 2008 level still, so if we get any kind of economic rebound from here that also will help in terms of kilowatt hour sales. ", "So, at the moment, I don\u2019t think there is any cause for alarm or concern here related to any kind of real change against our forecast with what we are seeing in the real world. And then on your question about the coupling, I am still a bit of a skeptic as it relates to that dramatic change in the business model, particularly on the electric side. I think frankly the Wisconsin Commission is a bit skeptical as well. ", "One other utility in the state has a pilot program for the coupling underway, I think every one has agreed to step back and let see the results down the road of that small coupling experiment to see if that\u2019s the right track to go down, but at the moment, I don\u2019t see a need for any dramatic change in the business model.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equity", "", "That\u2019s very helpful.

Two questions, one is could you provide some color on this comment you made in your prepared remarks regarding signs of a slowing economy in September and the second question is do you have any forecast, retail electric sale forecast for 2011?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure. I\u2019ll take the first and then Allen can give you some specifics on the forecast for 2011. Let me just say this, the forecast for 2011 based on what we have seen so far is unchanged from the forecast that we used in our rate case for 2011. But first a little bit of color on the slowdown, about the second to third week of September and we track, by the way Jim, we track 17 large sectors, large industrial sectors of the economy here every week.", "So, I see, Allen sees, Rick sees, we all see a weekly report on industrial energies by sector across these 17 large customer segments. For the third quarter, 13 of the 17 segments were green, in other words 13 of the 17 segments showed growth over the third quarter of a year ago. We are still seeing the majority of the segments have growth, but there is no question that about the second to third week of September, it\u2019s almost like our industrial customers took a collective breath, it\u2019s not one single segment, but a kind of across the board. ", "The growth rate slowed down and we are really kind of seeing a pause. Now, that pause has continued into October, I cannot tell you if it\u2019s permanent, if it\u2019s a blip or if we\u2019re starting to see the early signs of a downturn, but I can tell you its pretty visible in terms of at least a pause in the phase of the recovery and it\u2019s pretty much across the board.", "Jim Fleming", "", "Yes and then Jim, in terms of 2011 forecast for electric, if you look at things on a weather normalized basis, so in other words normalized \u201810 and then do a forecast for \u201811 based upon normal weather.

So, if say you saw decline in the effective tax rate in 2012 because of the production tax credits that you would expect to be able to generate, that would be reflected in rate making, so although the ETR may go down in \u201912, that would all sort of get washed through the rate making process so that the customers will have the benefit of that.", "", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Are we doing ITCs on any of these services?", "Jim Fleming", "We are not doing investment tax credit on it and we did a lot of analysis, it looks to us that the better option for the customers right now would be the PTCs the way things are currently structured.", "Gale Klappa", "And we did take a hard look at it, but clearly in our analysis for what we have in place, the better option was the production tax credit, Paul.

Thanks.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Gambuzza with Longbow Capital.", "Gale Klappa", "", "How you\u2019re doing Steve?", "Steve Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "", "I\u2019m doing great, thanks.", "Gale Klappa", "Good.", "Steve Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "Just wanted to ask about the outlook for flat weather normalized sales in 2011 in the context of your remarks on industrial activities, is it fair to assume that that outlook for flat weather normalized sales assumed that there is a slowdown that you see in September and October is really just a pause and that we\u2019ll see positive industrial world growth in 2011?", "Gale Klappa", "It really almost shows no growth from what we expected in 2011, I am sorry in 2010. So basically if you just look at everything weather normalized across the board, particularly on the largest industrial side it\u2019s really not any kind of up-tick from what we thought we were going to experience in 2010.", "Allen Leverett", "Then maybe just put in some numbers around it, I think that\u2019s qualitatively it\u2019s exactly what Gale talked about, but again overall slight reduction in retail about four times the percent.", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "For 2011.", "Allen Leverett", "That\u2019s correct.", "Gale Klappa", "Over weather normalized 2010.", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "Okay, and then, but I guess the -- I am just curious that the sources of, if you are going to have a slightly reduction would that be driven by one particular customer class or is that a slightly reduction across commercial, industrial or it\u2019s natural?", "Allen Leverett", "If we get down, Steve along the lines of small commercial and industrial, and large commercial and industrial. I would expect a very slight increase in small commercial and industrial probably about seven times of a percent and our current forecast is actually for decline in the large commercial and industrial right at 2% and one of the things that the impacting that we are going to see the final shutdown of the Chrysler plant in Kenosha and we\u2019re also expecting that MMSD, which is the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District, they\u2019re going to be doing some self generation. So, we would expect somehow to come off our system.", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "Steve, in fact that the Chrysler engine plant saw it\u2019s last production day this past Friday, so but we already add that crank into the forecast.", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "Excellent, thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Your are welcome Steve.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.", "Gale Klappa", "How is it going Jay?", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Very well, thank you. How are you?", "Gale Klappa", "We\u2019re doing fine.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Two questions actually, the first would be just a follow-up with the last question, if you normalized for Kenosha and then Chrysler plant in the Sewerage District Allen, what would that large industrial look like growth \u201911 over \u201910?", "Allen Leverett", "Jay, right of the path, I don\u2019t have anything normalized for those two.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "How bigger those two then maybe just the easier?", "Gale Klappa", "Chrysler is like our number 20 customer, it\u2019s in the top 25.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Got you.", "Gale Klappa", "And I don\u2019t, we just don\u2019t have the MMSD numbers in front of us.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Okay, no problem, the second question which was my primary one, Gale you spoke of the Oak Creek Unit 2 some equipment issues during start up here and I was wondering, maybe I missed it, but if you could possibly give us a little more detail on that and then just remind us under the settlement you signed the impact of any delay beyond November 28 of this year.", "Gale Klappa", "Sure and I\u2019ll ask Rick to join in and add, do whatever I provide you as well.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "That\u2019s great thanks.", "Gale Klappa", "In terms of the equipment issues, in essence of one of the things, I think they\u2019re actually positive, Bechtel is saying, they are in their operability run right now, one of the stringent requirements that we have in place with Bechtel before we will except the unit being ready for commercial service, is that the unit must run for 15 consecutive days at a capacity factor at or above 90% and they\u2019re in the final 48 hours or something like that wreck of the operability run.", "But one of the things Bechtel wants to do, if we think it\u2019s really positive, just bring the unit down after operability run, simply to do some equipment checks and replacement of a couple of elements et cetera. So, basically some equipment replacement and some equipment checks, and that will also give us an opportunity to do some additional inspection as well. ", "So, nothing that we are seeing at the movement that is overly alarming, but just the matter of being through and completely walking through this, so that when we take the unit, the unit has been as demonstrated it\u2019s ability and it\u2019s passed every single performance test and it\u2019s ready to rock. Rick?", "Rick Kuester", "I think you pretty much did Gale, the original plan and the reason we talked about the delay was for Bechtel run this operability run and in concurrently also do the performance test and there is three performance test Jay, there is a capacity test, heat rate or efficiency test and admissions test and we are going to do that concurrently. ", "What they\u2019re going to do now is finish the operability test, come down do some work on the plant, we are going to do some inspections and then they got to run the performance test after that.", "So, it\u2019s push this out a little further than we first expected, but like we say, the delay could be a few days, it could be a few weeks, but we still expect it to be fourth quarter event. And as you recall these performance test, one passed with flying colors, the first go around Unit 2, is essentially and identical unit. We don\u2019t see any impediment if Bechtel being able to pass these performance test.", "Gale Klappa", "And Jay to you second question, if for some reason the unit were to go beyond November 28 without being commercial, our agreement with Bechtel has November 28 said as the guarantee date beyond November 28 unless we and Bechtel agree on a weaver there would a liquidated damages owed to the utility of $250,000 a day.", "", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "In the way, we will have to attached [ph] extension of time some type of on call delay or [Inaudible] advance.", "Gale Klappa", "Exactly. So no calls for alarm at this stage of the game and I must say Rick is right, I mean we really think based on what we\u2019ve seen out at unit one and what we\u2019ve seen so far and the testing our of unit two, that these are going to be very efficient, very good units for our customers for many years to come.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "That\u2019s great. Thanks for the detail.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome, Jay. Well ladies and gentleman that concludes our conference call for today. We really appreciate your participating.

In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.", "During the discussions, reference to earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted, and our earnings per share will reflect the dilutive shares as of December 31, 2010. Also unless otherwise noted, the earnings per share figures stated on this call will not reflect the effects of the two for one stock split that will occur on March 1, 2011.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its 2010 year-end results at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Colleen, thank you. We found Colleen under 7 feet of snow this morning but she\u2019s doing fine. Well, good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our conference call to review the company\u2019s 2010 year-end results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Rick Kuester, President and CEO of We Generation; Allen Leverett, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, General Counsel; Jeff West, our Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, Controller.", "Alan will review our financial results in detail in just a moment but as you saw from our news release last yesterday we reported earnings from continuing operations of $3.84 a share for 2010. This compares with $3.19 a share for 2009.", "During 2010 we began to see an economic recovery across the region we serve as well as a return to more normal weather. Our earnings were also boosted by nearly a full year\u2019s contribution from our investment in the first expansion unit at Oak Creek. Overall I\u2019m very pleased with our financial and our operational performance for 2010, from customer satisfaction to network reliability to completion of our Power of the Future plan, the company made great strides during the year.", "Now I\u2019d like to spend just a moment on our continuing effort to upgrade the energy infrastructure in Wisconsin. Our Power of the Future plan is fundamental to the principle of energy self-sufficiency. Key components of our focus on self-sufficiency include investing in two combined cycle natural gas fired units at Port Washington, north of Milwaukee, the construction of two super critical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek, which is south of the city, and building a significant amount of renewable generation.", "I\u2019m delighted to report that since our last call Unit 2 at Oak Creek passed all of its performance tests and was placed into commercial service in the early morning hours of January 12, 2011. You may recall that the guaranteed turn over date for Unit 2 at Oak Creek was November 28, 2010. However during the final stages of testing, Bechtel experienced vibration problems with one of the main boiler feed pumps for Unit 2.", "During December and early January Bechtel addressed the technology issues and we were able to reach agreement on a number of other contractual items clearing the way for the Unit to achieve commercial service. As part of that agreement, Bechtel will pay liquidated damages totaling nearly $6 million as compensation for not meeting the guaranteed date. The $6 million will ultimately be passed to the benefit of our customers.", "Now the critical performance measures that Bechtel was required to meet before Unit 2 was declared ready for commercial operation, included an efficiency test, various emission tests, a capacity test and a 15-day reliability run. And I believe the results of these tests are of particular note.", "The efficiency test, or as we call it the heat rate test, measures the efficiency as which the unit converts fuel into electricity. The more efficient the unit obviously the less coal we have to burn and therefore the lower costs for each unit of electricity produced. For Unit 2 at Oak Creek, the demonstrated heat rate is more than 6% better than the guarantee and places this unit among the most efficient base load power plants anywhere in the country.", "With regard to emissions, we have been even more impressed by the plant\u2019s performance. The recorded emission level for each of the 15 pollutants measured at the stack is significantly lower than the levels allowed by our permit. In many cases, such as sulfur dioxide, particulate matter at mercury, the levels actually were a fraction of that allowed in our permit. The guaranteed capacity of each unit is 615 megawatts net \u2013 excuse me \u2013 and that means that the unit must be capable of delivering 615 megawatts into the transmission networks.", "During testing, the output was measured at 625 megawatts and we believe the unit can actually deliver more than 625 megawatts based on the extra margin available in both the boiler and the steam turbine generator or to put it simply, we\u2019re getting more capacity and more efficient capacity than we paid for.", "Turnover of Unit 2 at Oak Creek is a significant milestone and brings to a conclusion the development of the conventional generation in our Power the Future plan. The program was conceived as you recall just over a decade ago to insure that our customers would have a source of competitive reliable power for years to come and to insure that Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would have an energy supply network that could support new jobs and economic growth.", "It\u2019s not been an easy journey. Along the way we even took an interesting detour to the Wisconsin State Supreme Court, but I\u2019m delighted with the perseverance and the dedication of our staff and our contractors, who delivered on the largest construction effort by far in the history of the state. Of course this is not the end of the road, we still have much more to achieve. In particular we\u2019ll be focusing in the year ahead on unit reliability at Oak Creek. And to that end I\u2019m pleased to report that Unit 1 achieved an average availability during November, December and January of more than 94% and continues to operate very well.", "Now as you know, we also have a number of other major projects underway that form the foundation for our next leg of growth. Construction is proceeding very well on the second largest project in our history. The upgrade of the year quality controls for the existing coal-fired units at Oak Creek. At year end the project was 65% complete. We\u2019re investing, as you may recall, approximately $910 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue-gas desulfurization at selective catalytic reduction facilities. We expect these air quality controls to be completed in 2012.", "Another prime example is our investment plan for renewable energy, which is designed to meet the standards that are currently in place in Wisconsin. These standards call for an increase in the amount of electricity supplied by renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. Now the standard sets targets for each of the utilities in Wisconsin using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewables by the year 2015.", "Nearly three years ago we purchased a new wind farm development site, approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. The site called the Glacier Hills Wind Park is an ideal location for our newest wind far. In January of a year ago, the Wisconsin Commission approved our request for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to build up to 90 wind turbines, subject to modifications, the Commission may do our turbine siting criteria. After modifying a number of the turbine locations and negotiating additional agreements with land donors, we were able to maintain 90 turbines at the site. Each turbine will have a capacity of 1.8 megawatts, bringing the total generating capacity at Glacier Hills to 162 megawatts, the largest wind farm in the state.", "Construction at Glacier Hills began in May of 2010. Turbines are scheduled to begin arriving this spring with full commercial operation expected by the end of this year. Glacier Hills as I mentioned, will eclipse our 88-turbine Blue Sky Green Field Energy Center as the largest wind generating facility in Wisconsin. Our current estimate of the capital cost for Glacier Hills is $367 million; that excludes allowance for funds used during construction and reimbursable transmission costs. The project remains on schedule and on budget.", "Now as you may recall in the fall of 2009 we also announced our plans to build a 50-megawatt biomass fuel generating plant at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin. The paper mill was owned and operated by Domtar Corporation. We\u2019re fortunate to be close to significant forestlands that can be harvested in a sustainable manner. These forests have large amounts of wood waste that can be purchased to fuel the plant.", "As I\u2019ve mentioned before, diversification of our renewable energy supply is one of our important goals. As compared to wind the clear benefit from an operational standpoint is that we will be able to dispatch the biomass unit. Our investment in this project is projected to be approximately $255 million excluding AFUDC with a targeted in-service date in late 2013. We have received all the local permits necessary to move forward and the Wisconsin Public Service Commission has indicated that it will make a final decision in the case in the next four to six weeks. Construction could begin later this spring.", "Turning now to other major developments in the quarter, last month our board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend. That brings the annual dividend from $1.60 to $2.08 a share. Our new dividend policy targets a payout ratio of 50% to 55% of earnings going forward. Our first quarterly dividend for this year will be payable on March 1st at a rate of $0.52 a share.", "And as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware the board of Directors also approved a two-for-one split of our common shares. This is structured as a stock dividend with a record date of February 14th and a payable date of March 1st. I believe the stock split which is the company\u2019s first since 1992 will help maintain a trading arranged for our stock that is attractive to a wide range of institutional and individual investors.", "And just a reminder, unless we note otherwise, all of the per share amounts that we are discussing today are before the impact of the stock dividend.", "One other important note. Allen will talk in a moment about the cash impacts that we expect bonus depreciation to have on the company. Given the way our utility rate base is calculated the bonus depreciation will reduce our rate base somewhat. However, given the additional cash flow that bonus depreciation will provide we may well be in a position to move to the upper end of the range of our dividend payout ratio as early as 2012. And as a reminder, our policy calls for us to pay out between 50% and 55% of our earnings in dividends.", "And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Allen who will give you an update on financial performance for 2010 and our outlook for 2011. Alan?", "Allen Leverett", "Thanks, Gale. Now as Gale mentioned earlier, our annual 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $3.84 a share. And I\u2019ll focus on operating income by segment, and then touch on other income statement items. I\u2019ll also discuss cash flows for the year and cover our earnings guidance for 2011.", "Our consolidated operating income in 2010 was $810 million as compared to $660 million in 2009 for an increase of $150 million. Operating income in our Utility Energy segment totaled $564 million, an increase of $13 million versus 2009.", "The trends that we saw for the first nine months of the year continued through the fourth quarter. On an annual basis, we estimate that our Utility operating income was helped by $160 million of pricing increases, the largest of which related to our General Rate case in Wisconsin that was implemented in January of 2010.", "In addition we estimate that more favorable weather helped our Utility business by approximately $49 million, primarily as a result of a hot summer of 2010 as compared to the cool summer of 2009. Finally, our Utility depreciation expense was lower by $62 million as we implemented new depreciation rates in conjunction with the new Electric rates in January of 2010.", "On the other side of the ledger, we estimate that our Utility operating and maintenance cost increased by $215 million as compared to 2009. The significant portion of these costs were considered when the new rates were set. The largest items relate to the lease costs for the new coal units, operating costs associated with new units, increased costs to maintain our electric distributions system and higher accrued bad debt expense.", "In addition, our recovery of fuel expense was $63 million unfavorable as compared to 2009. In 2010, we under-collected fuel and purchased power costs by approximately $44 million, and in 2009 we had favorable recoveries of fuel by approximately $19 million. Finally, all other items were $20 million favorable including the impact of higher electric sales associated with improved economic conditions. When you add all these items together, you come to the $13 million in operating income at the Utility level.", "Operating income in the Non-Utility Energy segment, which primarily includes We Power, was up $132 million. This increase was driven by the earnings on Unit 1 at Oak Creek which was placed in the commercial operation in early February of 2010. Corporate and other affiliates had an operating loss of $6 million in 2010 compared to an operating loss of $11 million in 2009. The largest factor in this $5 million change was a $4 million favorable adjustment in 2010 related to corporate benefits expense. During 2010 we were able to settle certain benefit liabilities for amounts below their recorded value.", "Taking the changes for each of these segments together brings you back to the $150 million increase in operating income for 2010. During 2010 earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $60 million for a slight increase over the $59 million we reported for 2009. Other income increased by $11 million primarily because of increased allowance for funds used during construction on large utility construction projects including the air quality control systems in our existing Oak Creek plants.", "Net interest expense increased by almost $49 million. As we mentioned in prior calls, the increased interest expense was primarily driven by two factors related to the commercial operation of Unit 1 at Oak Creek. First, while the plant was being constructed we capitalized interest expense and our overall cost of debt, which was approximately 6%. Once the plant was placed into commercial operation, we no longer capitalized interest expense.", "The second factor relates to interest rates. Once the plant was placed into commercial operation, we issued long-term debt to finance a portion of the unit. The proceeds of the long-term debt were used to repay short-term debt incurred during construction. So the higher interest rates on the long-term debt led to higher interest expense. I would like to remind you though that the long-term interest rates were considered when the lease payments on the new unit were set.", "Consolidated income tax expense increased approximately $35 million because of higher pre-tax earnings partially offset by a lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2010 was 35.5% compared to 36.5% in 2009. This decline was primarily a result of a greater equity AFUDC and Section 199 production-related tax deductions. I expect that our effective tax rate in 2011 will be between 35% and 36%.", "Combining all of these items brings you to $454 million on net income from continuing operations for 2010 or earnings of $3.84 per share. Now during 2010 we generated $810 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis which is up $182 million when compared to the same period in 2009. The single largest factor that accounts for this improvement was the $289 million contribution we made to our benefit trust in 2009. We did not make any contributions to our benefit trusts in 2010.", "On an adjusted basis, our cash from operations totaled $996 million. The adjusted number includes the $186 million of cash impacts from the Point Beach bill credits. Under GAAP the cash from the bill credits is reflected as a change in restricted cash, which GAAP defines as an investing activity. From a management standpoint we consider this as a source of cash as it relates directly to the bill credits. I would note that as of the end of 2010 we had provided all of the credits of Point Beach to our customers.", "Total capital expenditures were approximately $798 million in 2010. About $687 million of this was dedicated to our utility businesses and the balance was primarily for the generating units being constructed as part of our Power the Future plan. In 2011, our total capital budget is approximately $953 million, $916 million of this is in our utility operations and the balance is primarily for our Power the Future program. Within the utility, we estimate that approximately $335 million will be spent on the Glacier Hills Wind Project and $166 million will be spent on environmental-related upgrades to our power plants. The remaining amount is expected to be spent on recurring utility projects.", "We paid $187 million in common dividends in 2010. Consistent with our dividend announcement last month, we expect to pay $243 million of dividends in 2011. On a GAAP basis, our debt to capital ratio was 56.9% as of December 31, 2010 and we were at 54.1% on an adjusted basis. These ratios are somewhat better than our December 31, 2009 levels. The adjusted amount treats half of our $500 million in hybrid securities of common equity, which is the approach used by the majority of the rating agencies.", "Looking to 2011, I expect that our debt to capital ratio will increase slightly this year, however, the debt to capital ratio should remain below 55% on adjusted basis. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, with the exception of the stock dividend to be paid on March 1, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Consistent with our financial plan, we did not make a contribution to our pension trust in 2010. However, our plan this year called for just over a $100 million contribution to our pension trust. We made this contribution on January 7 of this year. This contribution, along with the 11.5% trust investment returns in 2010, put us in a well-funded position.", "Going forward we are assuming long-term asset returns of 7.25%. I expect that our pension expense this year will be comparable to 2010 levels. As shown in the earnings package we posted on our Web site yesterday our actual 2010 retail sales of electricity increased 6%, as compared to 2009. On a weather normalized basis 2010 retail electric sales increased 2.3%. This is somewhat better than 0.9% weather normalized increase we had forecast in October. For 2011 we are projecting to see a slight decrease of 0.6% in the electricity sales versus normalized 2010 sales. This nominal decline is caused by a small forecasted drop in residential sales, because of low housing starts and the assumption that there will be continued conservation efforts.", "In the small commercial and industrial class, we expect to see moderate growth. Our large commercial and industrial class is forecasted to decline by 1.6%, because of plant closings, such as the Chrysler automotive plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin. In addition, a couple of our customers are in the process of building renewable generation projects, excluding these customers we expect our large commercial and industrial group to be relatively flat.", "On January 19, we completed the long term debt financing associated with the second coal-fired unit of our Power the Future plant. We issued $420 million of senior notes in two tranches. The first tranche was the $205 million note, with a coupon rate of 4.673% and a final maturity of January 19, 2031. The second tranche was a $215 million note, with a coupon rate of 5.848% and a final maturity of January 19, 2041. The net proceeds were used to repay short-term debt incurred during construction.", "On April 1, Wisconsin Energy has a $450 million, 6.5% note with matures. We expect to repay this maturity with internal cash and short-term debt. Later this year we expect Wisconsin Electric Power Company to issue approximately $300 million of long-term debt to help fund its construction program.", "In December we entered into a new three-year bank credit facilities to replace the old facilities that were expiring this spring. The new facilities are sized at $450 million for Wisconsin Energy, $500 million for Wisconsin Electric and $300 million for Wisconsin Gas.", "Our earnings guidance range for 2011 remains the same as what we provided to you in December. We expect our earnings in 2011 to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.20 per share before the stock split and $2.04 to $2.10 on a post-split basis.", "Now from this point forward in my presentation I will refer to our earnings per share on a basis that includes the new shares that will be issued in connection with the March 1st stock dividend. The earnings contribution from our Utilities segment, which includes Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, was $1.34 per share in 2010. Rate base for the combined utilities was about $5.6 billion in 2010 and we earned approximately 10.2% on equity for our overall retail utility business which excludes our ownership in American Transmission Company.", "Looking to this year combined rate base is expected to grow to $6.35 billion. We believe that our earned rate of return on equity will be about 9.7% in 2011, again excluding our American Transmission Company earnings and investment. At this point I expect our equity level at the utilities will be at or near the top of the 48.5% to 53.5% range set by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin.", "So to summarize we expect the earnings contribution of the Utility segment will increase to $1.39 per share in 2011. We expect the earnings contribution from our investment in the American Transmission Company to grow from $0.15 per share in 2010 to $0.16 per share this year.", "Moving now to We Power which includes the units at Port Washington as well as the units at Oak Creek, we expect the earnings contribution from We Power to increase from $0.48 per share in 2010 to $0.66 per share this year. Note that in order to be consistent with the basis of presentation we have used in the past this includes an allocation of holding company interest to We Power and does not include any impact of capitalized interest. Also, the estimated earnings for this year included about 11 months of earnings from Unit 2 at Oak Creek. In 2012, of course, we expect a full year of earnings contribution from both of the Oak Creek units.", "Finally, moving to the holding company we expect that the earnings reduction from unallocated holding company debt will increase from $0.05 to $0.13 per share. This is primarily because of the reduction in capitalized interest now that the Oak Creek units are complete.", "So to review, starting from the $1.92 per share that we earned in 2010 pro forma, for the shares to be issued in the stock dividend, Utility earnings are expected to increase $0.05 a share. Added to this is a projected $0.01 per share at ATC. We expect We Power to add $0.18 per share, and the holding company interests to reduce earnings $0.08 per share. Adding these changes together brings you from the actual base of earnings of $1.92 per share in 2010 to $2.08 a share, which is the midpoint of the guidance range this year. Again, all of these values for 2010 and 2011 include the new shares from the stock dividend.", "In December of 2010, the President signed several income tax changes into law. These included an extension of the bonus depreciation rules to projects acquired and placed in service in 2011 and 2012. As a result of this change in law, we anticipate that certain projects will benefit from the increased bonus depreciation in 2011 and 2012, such as our Glacier Hills and South Oak Creek Air Quality projects. Given our interpretation of the bonus depreciation rules, it does not appear that Oak Creek Unit 2 will benefit from bonus depreciation.", "Also, the rules appear to require 50% as opposed to 100% bonus depreciation for Glacier Hills and the South Oak Creek Air Quality Control System. At this point, we estimate $100 million in cash benefits from bonus depreciation this year and another $200 million in 2012. I expect that there will be a small amount of additional benefits post 2012.", "Now as Gale mentioned, the bonus depreciation will also have an impact on our Utility rate base because of the additional build-up of deferred tax liability caused by the increased tax depreciation. At this point I estimate that our total Utility rate base will be approximately $6.7 million in 2012. This is down from the $7 million projection we made last year because of bonus depreciation as well as favorable working capital balances and better than budget capital spending.", "However, just to reiterate what Gale said earlier, we believe the additional cash positions us to move faster on the dividend. Just for example, a move from a 50 to a 55% payout ratio would translate into a 10% increase in the dividend before factoring in expected earnings growth.", "I would also like to provide you with some input on our expectations for earnings in the first quarter. Overall we expect our first quarter 2011 earnings to be higher than our first quarter 2010 earnings. As a starting point, when you take into consideration the additional shares from the March 1 stock dividend, our first quarter 2010 earnings from continuing operations were $0.55 per share. We expect to see higher earnings in the Utility segment because last year we were hurt by warm winter weather and a significant under recovery of fuel and purchase power costs.", "Overall I would expect utility earnings to be up $0.08 to $0.12 per share in the first quarter of 2011. The contribution from ATC should be roughly level compared to last year. Then, if you turn to the non-utility energy segment, during the first quarter of 2011 we expect to see three months of earnings from Unit 1 at Oak Creek as well as 2.5 months of earnings from Unit 2 at Oak Creek. Last year, Unit 2 was placed into commercial operation in early February and Unit 2 was under construction.", "In total, I estimate that We Power earnings contribution will be up about $0.05 per share. The earnings contribution at the holding company is expected to be down about $0.03 per share primarily because of a decreased ability to capitalized interest.", "So, to review starting from the $0.55 per share in the first quarter of 2010 add $0.08 to $0.12 per share at the utilities, $0.05 per share for We Power and subtract $0.03 per share for the holding company, which brings you to a range of $0.65 to $0.69 per share for the first quarter of 2011. So with that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Allen, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Morgan Stanley.", "Gale Klappa", "Afternoon, Greg.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. My first quarter is how many touchdowns is Aaron Rodgers going to throw on Sunday?", "Gale Klappa", "I think five.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Well, I got root for them now that the Jets are sidelined, but...", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah. Sorry about the foot fetish thing.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Sorry about a lot of things, including that. So, the first quarter goes to your sales forecast for 2011. You guys came into 2010 with an extremely conservative outlook and we wound up, I mean we had the benefit of weather of course, but we wound up having pretty significant recovery in industrial demand, wind up making your forecast unduly conservative, so yeah, I know you guys like to under promise and over deliver. What areas of your sales forecast could you be airing on the side of caution?", "Gale Klappa", "Well I can give you my view on that and I\u2019m sure Allen will have a view as well. Let me first say that one of the ways, Greg, we put together our sales forecast is with one-on-one discussions with about 200 of our largest commercial and industrial customers. So if there\u2019s conservatism built into the forecast it\u2019s really coming straight from our customers. So that\u2019s one piece of information that might be helpful but you are absolutely correct. We did see a stronger return in terms of demand from our large commercial and industrial customers and either they or we have been projecting in 2010.", "Having said that, one off the factors and Allen mentioned this that is affecting the 2011 forecast is the fact that the automotive \u2013 it was actually the engine assembly plant for Chrysler in Kenosha has closed its doors and we have factored that into our forecast. The other thing that I think is influencing the forecast, Greg, is that two of our very largest customers, the iron ore mines in the upper peninsula of Michigan and a major specialty steel company here in Wisconsin, both are running at very high levels of capacity and those two customers were very much responsible for a lot of the uptick we saw in terms of our industrial demand last year and we think that further increases from here won\u2019t be as strong as what we\u2019ve seen.", "So that just gives you a sense but if we\u2019ve erred on the conservative side, so be it. And I think the basic message that I would leave with you is unlike lots of other companies we are not counting on any material increase at all in customer demand to achieve our earnings targets for 2011. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. I guess maybe just to add two things, Greg. On the residential class if you look normal-to-normal, so you take 2011 forecast assuming normal weather and normalized 2010, we\u2019re expecting about a 0.4 of 1% reduction in residential. And I think as I mentioned in the script, part of our reason for that forecast is the assumption that there will be continued conservation efforts. Honestly, I mean that\u2019s somewhat speculative. We don\u2019t yet know how people are going to behave as it relates to conservation efforts. So to use Gale\u2019s words, we could be overly conservative from that standpoint.", "And then the only other thing I mean, if you \u2013 just to give you a feel for just the sensitivity of our earnings to sales growth, let\u2019s just say if instead of a 0.6% decline overall in sales, let\u2019s say there was a 1% excursion up. So instead of a 0.6 reduction say we had a 0.4% increase in sales, normal-to-normal, well that would mean about $16 million of pre-tax margin for us which on the new base of shares is about $0.04 a share. So that gives you a feel for how sensitive things would be if we are being overly conservative.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. And my second question, just to clarify, looking at you last published investor presentation you were targeting average rate base. You said this in your presentation of $7 billion. That was the impact of bonus depreciation. In 2012 you\u2019re looking at more like $6.7 billion, correct?", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct.", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, the bottom line number that\u2019s right, $6.7 billion, but really that decline is because of three things Greg, one is bonus depreciation certainly, but we\u2019ve done better on working capital that we expected and we have under spent our capital budget. So all three of those combined are moving you from that say, roughly seven to that approximately $6.7 billion in 2012.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right. And you\u2019re looking, but you\u2019re looking at the commensurate ability to hypothetically increase the payout ratio, given your stronger cash position, at least that is what you said earlier.", "Allen Leverett", "You\u2019re actually right.", "Gale Klappa", "Going from \u2013 again, we\u2019ve said 50 to 55% payout ratio is our target, that\u2019s the policy the Board has adopted, but as you recall when the Board adopted that policy in December and we didn\u2019t know at that time about the bonus depreciation we also said, we\u2019d probably be at the lower end of that payout range for a while. Now we think the bonus depreciation and what we see coming in terms of cash flow positions us to move potentially very quickly up to that 55% level.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "Take care. Go pack.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalman. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Brian. Good afternoon.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalman", "Hi, good afternoon. Just you mentioned that you\u2019re expected to be at the high end of the range of your equity ratio in \u201811, how should we kind of view what that equity ratio might look like in your upcoming Wisconsin general rate case filing?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, typically the filings with the Commission, what we filed and the Commission has ultimately approved is an equity range of 48.5 to 53.5, and then what they do, Brian, is when they set your revenue requirements, if you will, for rate making, they assume a number right down the middle of that range, in other words, 51%. So I would suggest and this is just a forecast, but if you\u2019re looking at longer term numbers, probably a reasonable assumption to make is that you\u2019ve got an equity ratio near the middle of that range, and then, you know, you make your own assumptions about what allowed returns look like down the road.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalman", "Okay. So when we think back to when you laid out some of those 2012 financial drivers, I guess the only thing that has changed is the rate base going from $7 billion down to $6/$7 billion, but all of the other drivers that laid out are relatively intact?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, other than the very significant driver that we talked about which was cash, and we\u2019re a much better cash position now given bonus depreciation and where we were on those other factors that I mentioned. So that\u2019s cash and a little bit of a decline in the projected rate base. Those are the two major differences, Brian.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalman", "Okay. And then just some of the longer term renewable projects that you guys are considering, a solar 12.5 megawatt plant I believe sometime in \u201813, then the longer term renewables that I think previously you outlined, possibly 500 megawatts necessary to meet the \u201815 requirement? Has any of that changed? Or is any of that influenced by the shift in the political landscape in Wisconsin?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, you\u2019re asking a very good question, Brian, and I think there are kind of three pieces to the answer. The first is that obviously our next major focus as I mentioned in our prepared remarks is the biomass plant that we proposed for northern Wisconsin, about a $255 million project. We think it\u2019s a very solid project and we expect a decision from the commission in the next four to six weeks. Now if you step back and say, okay, with the two major wind farms that we will have in place by the end of this year, and assuming we get approval on the biomass project, and with the way the formula works that allows banking for early compliance, with all of those things we could meet the 2015 standard for one year. So without any further renewable construction if you will, but just given Glacier Hills, given Blue Sky Green Field, given the biomass project and the banking of credits from early compliance, for one year in 2015 we could meet the standard.", "And I think what we need to do now, other than continuing to push forward with the biomass plan if approved, is really take a pause and see what the Walker administration wants to do related to renewables spending in the state going forward after 2015. I don\u2019t believe that will be one of the first two or three things on his agenda, but by the end of 2011, I do expect there will be some attention paid by the legislature and the Walker administration to what that looks like, what the renewable goals look like with this new administration.", "A couple of the things that have been beginning to be discussed, and there\u2019s nothing set in concrete in terms of a change in policy at this stage of the game, but a couple of the things that are beginning to be discussed are things like, should the definition of renewables be changed? Or should the utilities be given an extra five years, say to 2020, to meet the compliance standard? Those are all things that are in the discussion stage and the thought stage at this point in time.", "So we\u2019re actually in a very good position in that with the work we\u2019ve done so far and with the biomass project that we have teed up final approval I hope at the Commission, we could actually deliver the goal for 2015, but that would require using a \u2013 the bank of credits and therefore the question becomes what after 2015 and we\u2019ll get clarity on that I believe this year. Does that help?", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalman", "Yes it does. Thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Rock and roll, Michael.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys. Two questions. One, can you just provide an update on growth opportunities if any for American Transmission Company and two, for your remaining coal plants that lake pollution controls primarily scrubbers, can you talk about the time line for when you\u2019re likely to have to make decisions about whether it\u2019s retirement, whether it\u2019s repowering, whether it\u2019s adding the controls, whatever option you choose?", "Gale Klappa", "Michael, this is Gale. I\u2019ll tackle the \u2013 and Rick is here with us, so he can add in any of his thoughts, but we\u2019ll tackle if you don\u2019t mind the question about the coal plants first.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Sure.", "Gale Klappa", "Based on everything we can tell, with the proposed EPA rules coming down the road, it is likely we will have three plants that may require some amount of modification. The three plants are the Valley plant, which is an older coal-fired unit just south of the downtown area of Milwaukee. The second is called the Milwaukee County Grounds plant, that is a much smaller \u2013 much, much smaller plant that provides steam-chilled water to a huge medical complex on the western side of city and then the third plant is the Presque Isle plant, which is an older coal-fired facility in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.", "All three of the plants have reliability, must run characteristics. The Valley plant for example is the only remaining operating power plant inside the city of Milwaukee and provides not only steam to all of the major downtown buildings, but also provides voltage support for the load pocket. So that\u2019s a must-run facility and Rick has a team studying what our options, our best options there should we need to make modifications.", "And then we have a similar study underway for the Milwaukee County grounds and also we\u2019re now beginning to take a very hard look at what might need to be done in the Upper Peninsula with the Presque Isle plant. I think the next milestone will be probably February 22 when the EPA is expected to come out with its new Industrial Boiler MACT, Maximum Available Control Technology rules. But we are thinking that we will have to devote at least a couple of hundred million dollars of capital spending to modifications of the plant. Rick, how about add to that?", "Rick Kuester", "Yeah, those modifications could be in the form of additional controls or it could be conversion to gas. As Gale said, these plants have must-run characteristics either because of steam or because of where they sit on the grid. So we\u2019re taking a hard look at what does it makes sense in terms of what to convert, what to put additional controls on. Timelines we would expect by this year we\u2019d be making some decisions on Milwaukee Kennedy (ph) which is subject to the Industrial Boiler MACT rules and probably also for Valley which is not subject to Industrial Boiler MACT rules, they\u2019re subject to the Electric Generating Unit MACT rules. And the dividing line is 25 megawatts: above 25 megawatts, EGU; below 25 megawatts, it\u2019s Industrial Boiler.", "I expect on those two plants we\u2019ll be making decision this year, implementation kind of middle of the decade. Presque Isle is going to be just right behind that and so I think the capital that we\u2019ll be spending will be primarily in the \u201812 through \u201814 to \u201815 timeframe.", "Gale Klappa", "And what we\u2019re seeing, and Rick is really relating to this, is that some of the proposed rules of 2015 compliance dates. And that\u2019s why Rick is thinking \u201812, \u201813 and \u201814 for much of that capital that we may need to spend on those three plants.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So when I think about your rate base numbers for 2012 I assume that doesn\u2019t exclude the several hundred million dollars of potential spend on the existing coal units?", "Gale Klappa", "There wouldn\u2019t be much in 2012. No. Again, most of those dollars if we end up needing to spend them, yeah, would be \u2013 exactly. The study dollars in 2012, actual capital spending in \u201813 and \u201814.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay.", "Allen Leverett", "And then, Michael, on ATC, as you may or may not know, every October American Transmission Company will publish a new 10-year spending plan. And when they did their update this October, their spending plan over the next 10 years would call for $3.4 billion of spending. Their previous 10-year plan called for about $2.5 billion of spending. So there is really an increase of $900 million between the two plans.", "The driver for the increase was almost exclusively for really two lines, two new 345-kV lines. One which is a new east-west interconnection from the Madison area over to Minnesota, and then a north-south line, if you will, going down to Iowa. So that was most of the increase, most of the driver for the increase from the", "$2.5 billion to the $3.4 billion. So if those projects are done, transmission projects have an even longer gestation than generating plants, I mean that spending \u2013 that additional spending would be five years out but there\u2019s quite a bit of additional spending that would be in their plan.", "In terms of outside the footprint for ATC, meaning outside of Wisconsin, outside of the U.P. of Michigan, at this point, Michael, we wouldn\u2019t have anything that would be in specific enough terms to talk about really.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.", "Gale Klappa", "More than welcome. Thank you, Michael.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Von Riesemann with UBS. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "How you doing, Jim?", "Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Good afternoon. I\u2019m doing well. Thanks.", "Gale Klappa", "Good afternoon to you.", "Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Two questions. The first one is, if I\u2019ve missed it, I apologize, but could you provide an update with respect to the timing of the rate case and what some of the key parameters might be and then the second question revolves around M&A chatter. So this is for you, Gale. In that regard, could you talk broadly about what makes sense, what doesn\u2019t make sense for Wisconsin Energy? And if I remember correctly, Wisconsin has a holding company as compared to which can be prohibitive or impede a lot of M&A both intra as well as interstate. Could you just refresh our memories as to what those hurdles are?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure. I\u2019ll be happy to, Jim. First, in terms of the rate case and we can let Allen quantify the drivers for you but I would expect in terms of the timing of the filing, it would be sometime late spring and we would expect a pretty modest rate request simply because that\u2019s the position we\u2019re in at this stage in the game. And the drivers clearly will be \u2013 Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. I think, far and away, I mean, we have two projects, Jim, that have been accruing really for 100% of the plant of the balances they\u2019ve been accruing AFUDC as opposed to some sort of quip and rate base, sort of concept. So one of those is the South Oak Creek air quality; the other is Glacier Hills. So far and away, I mean, there\u2019s over $1 billion worth of capital that\u2019s not in rates that\u2019ll have to be put in rates related, again, to South Oak Creek AQCS and Glacier Hills. So that\u2019ll be a very significant driver in the case.", "Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "And really we\u2019re seeing reasonably flat O&M projections so the O&M component that would be going up in association with the rate case largely driven by the O&M that we\u2019re going to have to operate the new air quality controls at South Oak Creek so we \u2013 again, I think this will be a pretty modest rate request and you can expect it late spring and the drivers are the capital expenditures that Allen mentioned.", "Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Super. And then on the M&A side?", "Gale Klappa", "On the M&A side, let me first say that, I think, given the size of the company and given the prospects we see certainly there\u2019s no requirement in mind whatsoever for us to acquire another utility. So first of all I think we are just fine with our growth prospects, with the economies of scale that we have and I would just say to you, it\u2019s not one of the top ten things that I\u2019m overly concerned about at the moment. If the stars and moon align then it would certainly be something we would look at.", "Related to the holding company act in Wisconsin, I don\u2019t believe it would be a huge impediment for a merger or acquisition or combination inside the state. But there clearly needs to be demonstrated customer benefit and I think the easier \u2013 obviously the easier demonstration of customer benefit would be for combinations inside the state, but I don\u2019t see the holding company act in Wisconsin being a tremendous impediment if there was friendly merger or combination that was on the horizon.", "For us, we would apply the same type of criteria we have mentioned in the past to any type of potential acquisition and that would be we would want it to be accretive certainly by the end of year one. We would want it to be at a minimum credit neutral and we would want it to be at least neutral to positive to our long-term earnings per share growth rate. I\u2019m a firm believe that you really need to apply those kinds of criteria for a combination to deliver shareholder value that what our job really is to do. So we would be pretty strict about applying those type of criteria to any potential acquisition that we might look at and I hope that answers your question, Jim.", "Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "It does, but it raises one other one, thank you. The question is long-term growth rates and you\u2019ve been pretty silent on eliciting a longer-term growth rate these days, care to comment?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, I think the longer term growth rates really are a function of economic growth, a function of customer growth and a function of some of the environmental rules potentially that we need to be facing. As we mentioned to you there\u2019s an entire host of new environmental rules that the Environmental Protection Agency is proposing. We\u2019re ahead of the curve on many of \u2013 compliance with many of those rules, but to give you a really solid, long-term view, I would like to have a much better field for what we\u2019re looking at related to EPA requirements and I think we\u2019ll get that this year.", "Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and then I guess my follow up to that is, if you think about it mathematically and everything we all learned in business school, if you take the ROE times the payout ratio and ROE, call it 10.5 of the payout ratio, better than 50% suggests at least 5.5% long-term growth rate. Is that in the realm of reasonableness?", "Gale Klappa", "I would say, for us four to six might be a reasonable long term growth rate, but we can give you a much better feel once we have a very good sense of the EPA requirements, but I \u2013 at the moment and this is just again, sheer speculation on my part, if I were going to try to chunk in a long term growth rate into the model I would do four to six.", "Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Jim.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Edward Heyn with Catapult. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Ted, how\u2019s it going?", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Good, Gale. Good afternoon.", "Gale Klappa", "Are you giving me 3.5 in Green Bay?", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Yeah. That seems like a decent spread. You guys have a good chance I think.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re giving me 3.5?", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Yeah. All right.", "Gale Klappa", "All right. What are we \u2013 what is this friendly wager for?", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "I guess a New York apple versus a Wisconsin block of cheese or something.", "Gale Klappa", "All right. That apple better be big.", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Yeah. A quick question on the \u2013 just on the rate base. I know that you have benefited the bonus depreciation. Thinking about $300 million of rate base, if I just take 10% ROE and a 50% equity ratio, that\u2019s about $15 million in net income. And on your old share count was on $117 a share that seems like $0.12 of earnings pressure, is that the right way to think about relative to how you were thinking about things before the bonus depreciation that your $0.12 number could be $0.10 lighter but you\u2019re going to try to give that back with cash distributed through dividends.", "Allen Leverett", "Well, one thing, there\u2019s sort of a complication about the way these rate base calculations are done, Ted. There\u2019s this averaging process that occurs. So when they look at your rate base in a given test period, they look at 13 month average over that period. So, for example, if you had bonus depreciation benefits that occur relatively late in the year, that in affect doesn\u2019t count dollar for dollar against you in that period.", "So if I just sort of narrow down, Ted, and look at the bonus depreciation impact on rate base and say look in the 2012 test period, do all the averaging that\u2019s done, the bonus depreciation only has about $100 million impact in 2012. So you can go through the same math that you were going through, but effectively the bonus depreciation impact on rate base is only about $100 million in 2012 and then I would say the bonus depreciation impact is about $300 million in 2013.", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Okay.", "Allen Leverett", "But then as you say, that provides additional cash in effective from operations they can be used to faster on the dividend. So hopefully I haven\u2019t overly complicated things, but just keep that in mind. There is this averaging that occurs.", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Okay. So it seems like the $300 million of rate base is not just bonus D&A, it\u2019s also under-spending on capital. I guess, whether it\u2019s bonus D&A, or just lower spend, is it right to think that $0.10 number right of kind of earnings power relative to how you were thinking about it before when you gave a $7 billion rate base number?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, that\u2019s the right zip code. The other thing you have to take into account though when you\u2019re doing that 50/50, well there\u2019s \u2013 say you take $100 million just to make the numbers work easy, one of the things you have to add back is the fact that all other things being equal there\u2019d be $50 million less debt at the holding company and less interest at the holding company. So there\u2019s a little bit of an add-back for that, Ted, that you have to sort of \u2013", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Okay, just the cost of that capital is going to be cheaper?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah...", "Gale Klappa", "And you\u2019re in the right zip code, though, Ted.", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Okay. That\u2019s great. And then just on the \u2013 Allen, could you give us \u2013 I think typically you give breakdowns for CapEx for the next couple of years, is this appropriate time for that refresh?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, there\u2019ll certainly be very fulsome disclosure in the 10-K that we\u2019ll come out with later this month, but my current estimates, Ted, I think I\u2019d mentioned $935 million for 2011, I expect will be at about somewhere between $656 and $681 in 2012, and then I would say in 2013, probably around $540 million.", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "$540 million in \u201813? Okay.", "Allen Leverett", "Now the assumption just to be clear on what\u2019s behind that, I have not assumed any additional renewable projects past Glacier Hills or Domtar in those numbers. So that says, okay just to assume for conservatism at this point we\u2019re not doing any additional renewable in this period past Glacier Hills, Domtar, you get to those numbers that I talked about. And then like I said, there\u2019ll be some additional disclosure in some more detail in the 10-K later this month.", "Edward Heyn \u2013 Catapult", "Got you. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line from Steven Gambuzza with Longbow Capital. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "How are you, Steve?", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "Good, thanks. I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks that the Point Beach credits ended at the end of 2010? Is that right?", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct.", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "Just curious what the impact will be this year then for \u2013 because this was not a rate case year, so there were no change in base rates in 2011, so is it the only really change should be the phase out of those credits?", "Gale Klappa", "In terms of customer bills?", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "Yes.", "Gale Klappa", "Yes. Well there will be two changes. One, the phase out of the credits. And then the second is that we have a fuel case pending with a very modest increase in fuel costs and I expect that\u2019ll be decided by the commission in the next month. So the only changes we would see for customer impact or customer bills in 2011 are those two, basically the expiration of the Point Beach credits and the very modest 1%-ish type fuel increase.", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "And on a percentage basis roughly, what is the impact of the Point Beach credit for an average customer bill?", "Gale Klappa", "About 5%.", "Steven Gambuzza \u2013 Longbow Capital", "Five percent. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Steve.", "Operator", "Alex Kania with Bank of America. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Greetings, Alex. How are you?", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Hey. Good afternoon. Hope the snow hasn\u2019t been too horrible for you guys today.", "Gale Klappa", "We\u2019ve shoveled out of about eight foot snowdrifts, but we\u2019re here.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Well (indiscernible). Yes, thank you for coming out with the earnings release. I have two questions for you. I think the first one is if Allen could give just a little more elaboration on the bonus depreciation standard of the 50% versus the 100%? Just because we were trying to figure out for you guys and certainly other utilities how much would actually be able to be taken in terms of accelerated depreciation and what your understanding of that rule is.", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, let me start with that. And, Alex, basically what the new law provides for are two windows on bonus depreciation, if you will. One window for 100% and another window for 50%. So the window for 100% extends from September 8, 2010 to January 1, 2012. The window for 50% extends from January 1, 2008 to December 31, 2012. So you have those two windows. And obviously, the window for 50% is much broader in time than the 100%. Then what you do is to determine whether you qualify for a window, you apply a two-part test. The first part of that test is placed in service. So that\u2019s pretty straightforward. A piece of property that goes commercial in that window you can put a check mark by that test. The second test is the so-called acquired-in test.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Right.", "Allen Leverett", "And what that means is that you have to have at least 90% of your project expenditures within the window. So, for example, you have a project where you spend at least 90% of the project within that window, so say 100%, from September \u201810 to January 1, 2012. If you spend 90% of that window and it\u2019s placed in service in that window, you\u2019re a winner. You get 100% bonus depreciation.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "You get 100%.", "Allen Leverett", "If you fail the 100%, then you can go back and test to see if you apply, if you qualify for the 50% window. So then for us, Alex, and I\u2019m probably telling you more than you want to know, but for us, if you go through all of the major projects, well, Oak Creek 1 and 2, well, they fail both of these because you didn\u2019t spend 90% of the money for those projects in either of those windows.", "Gale Klappa", "During the window.", "Allen Leverett", "So you had expenditures that \u2013 significant expenditures before 2008. South Oak Creek AQCS, it\u2019s good for 50% but not for 100% and then Glacier Hills, good for 50%, not for 100%.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Got it.", "Allen Leverett", "The other thing, Alex, to keep in mind, and I\u2019ve seen some folks that maybe don\u2019t understand this nuance, I\u2019m sure you do but...", "Gale Klappa", "Oh, I know Alex understands.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Of course. I\u2019m just sitting through for the benefit of everybody else, right?", "Gale Klappa", "That\u2019s right.", "Allen Leverett", "So for us this bonus means about an additional $1 billion of tax depreciation that gets moved off in time. So when you\u2019re figuring out what the theoretical cash tax benefit of that is you can\u2019t just apply some 40% combined tax rate because what happens, at least in the states we do business, the states don\u2019t pay any attention to bonus depreciation. So immediately you go to a federal rate rather than a combined state and federal rate. Then in addition, there\u2019s an interaction with the Section 199.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Manufacturing credit? Yeah.", "Gale Klappa", "Manufacturing credit.", "Allen Leverett", "Well, it\u2019s actually a deduction, not a credit, but anyway, that\u2019s another 20-minute discussion. So it takes you from a combined rate of 40% down to something more like 32% once you put in the 199 leakage. So for us it\u2019s about $1 billion of tax depreciation, $320 million worth of cash tax benefit and then in time you take the benefit along the lines of what I described in the script. So $100 million in 2011, $200 million in 2012, and then the rest. So you\u2019re probably sorry you asked now but that\u2019s...", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "No. That\u2019s perfect. That\u2019s great actually. I\u2019ve never heard kind of as clear an explanation to be honest. So it\u2019s helpful and thanks for the rules.", "Gale Klappa", "Alex, in time it all turns around.", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. It does.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Yeah. It will, of course.", "Allen Leverett", "It all turns around.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Great. And then my second question is just making sure that doing more of these rate base masks kind of things. Looking from \u201811 to \u201812, and you\u2019ve give a few of the pieces. $6.7 billion in \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, where are we in 2000? We\u2019re about $6.35 billion in \u201812, up to $6.7 billion \u2013 $6.35 billion in \u201811, $6.7 billion in \u201812. And then in \u201811 you\u2019re thinking that your equity layer is going to be toward the high end of the allowed range which is about 53.5%.", "Allen Leverett", "That\u2019s right.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "So that\u2019s kind of saying that you guys have \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that is, about $3.4 billion or so of equity that you\u2019ve got locked at the utilities for 2011, for the most part on average. Right?", "Allen Leverett", "That\u2019s right.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. So verily so if I just assumed going into 2012 that presumably that you\u2019re not going to reduce that equity layer, I mean, I guess you could theoretically but if I \u2013 even if the net was flat and you just dividend it out all of the kind of all of your retained earnings and kept that ugly layer flat that you\u2019d be looking in 2012 at like a 51% equity layer? Is that fair to think about?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. I think I had an earlier question about that.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Yes.", "Allen Leverett", "I think sitting here today it\u2019s reasonable to assume you\u2019d be at the mid-point of the equity range.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. Got it. Okay. That\u2019s perfect. I was just making sure I was thinking about that right. Well, great. Well, thanks very much, guys, and good luck on Sunday.", "Gale Klappa", "Thanks, Alex.", "Alex Kania \u2013 Bank of America", "Take care. Bye.", "Gale Klappa", "Take care.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Carl Seligson with Utility Financial. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Welcome, Carl. How are you?", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Thank you, Gale. Doing well. You guys are so good at explaining things I wondered if you\u2019d tell me what depreciation is. I\u2019m teasing. What\u2019s going on with Mark Meyer? Is he going to get re-appointed? And if not, what\u2019s the likelihood that you\u2019ll get someone who\u2019s less favorably disposed?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, Mark\u2019s term expires on March 1.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Right.", "Gale Klappa", "And for those listening who are not familiar with the name, Mark is one of the three appointed commissioners at the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. The commissioners are appointed for six-year terms, and Mark\u2019s term runs out on March 1. He has indicated a number of months ago that he wished to pursue other opportunities. And regardless of the outcome of the election, he did not wish to be re-appointed as a commissioner. So the Walker administration is right now in the final throes of selecting a nominee who will become, actually, the chairman of the commission.", "In Wisconsin, the governor has the automatic right once there is a vacancy on the commission to appoint the chairman. So the person that will be appointed by the Walker administration will become the new chairman probably sometime in March. And we, obviously, don\u2019t know yet who that person will be. But I\u2019m confident that they are working hard to select a person with financial acumen and a person with a very good balance and business expertise.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Is that subject to any kind of confirmation process in the legislature?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes. The appointment to the commission must be confirmed by the state senate. But, of course, in Wisconsin in the last election, the Republicans gained control of both the assembly and the state senate.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Right.", "Gale Klappa", "So I wouldn\u2019t foresee any quality candidate having any difficulty being confirmed by the state senate.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Is there a possibility that Chairman Callisto would bag it on the basis of not being chairman anymore?", "Gale Klappa", "His term \u2013 he has, I believe, until 2014 for his term to run.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "\u201815", "Gale Klappa", "I believe it\u2019s \u201814, Carl. But at any rate, I don\u2019t know. I think at the moment Eric would be inclined to stay at the commission although certainly it would not be unusual given a change of administration for a commissioner to look for another opportunity, but at the moment I don\u2019t see any other immediate change.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "I guess there is the possibility of a significant turnaround as a result of the election, so you could have two Republicans in term in time.", "Gale Klappa", "Yes and I expect in time we will have.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Right. Okay. Thanks very much. And aren\u2019t you glad to have three guys there from Atlanta in all this snow.", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah, they\u2019re not real good at shoveling though.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Imagine that. You got to teach them, you had it early.", "Gale Klappa", "Amen.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "Thanks, Carl.", "Carl Seligson \u2013 Utility Financial", "Thanks. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Hey, Paul. How you doing?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Fine. How are you?", "Gale Klappa", "Doing great. What can we do for you today, Paul.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "I\u2019m not a Packers fan, but I hate the Steelers though. Good luck.", "Gale Klappa", "All right. Rock and roll.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Update on fuel legislation. Allen, you talked about part of the lower rate base would be offset by reduced debt cost, but wouldn\u2019t that just go to rate payers? What was weather versus normal in 2010, what have you seen so far and is that in your first quarter guidance? And then lastly, your former employer had a pretty wide spread of potential environmental CapEx. Would you like to put bookends on it?", "Gale Klappa", "Let me, well let\u2019s see that\u2019s about eight questions, Paul, let\u2019s try to tackle them one at a time. You had asked about fuel rules?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Yes.", "Gale Klappa", "In the waning days of the past legislature at the end of December, new fuel rules were finalized. And so we have going into 2011 a new set of rules that are a modest improvement I think from the prior rules, in that each utility will be asked to come in, in the fall of the year and present their projected fuel costs for the next year. And then there will be a brief one-day hearing and the Commission will set a new fuel rate if required that would take effect in January 1 of a given year and apply for the next year. So that should be somewhat helpful in terms of reducing the volatility.", "And then secondly the 2% bandwidth that has applied in the past, in other words a fuel rate is set and unless your costs deviate plus or minus 2% or more than 2% from the rate that\u2019s been set, you have the upside potential and the downside risk and that stays in place. But a new fuel rule is now in place in the state of Wisconsin. And Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah, and I\u2019m not sure that I totally understood where you were going with the interest benefit. The only interest benefit that I recall talking about were some interest benefits of the holding company.", "Gale Klappa", "Right.", "Allen Leverett", "And so of course if you had a reduction in interest expense at the holding company that doesn\u2019t in any way get wrapped into retail regulation.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay. I understand. Thanks.", "Allen Leverett", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "All right. And we may have lost your other questions. Can you \u2013 is there anything else you\u2019d like us to address Paul?", "Allen Leverett", "I thought you had one more question. I wasn\u2019t sure.", "Gale Klappa", "Well, we can\u2019t remember and obviously you can\u2019t either, but we appreciate you asking, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Travis Miller with Morningstar.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Travis. Good afternoon.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Good afternoon to you. A real quick question, given the amount of cash that you guys have coming in, in projective the next couple of years, any projections or plans for additional pension contributions?", "Gale Klappa", "Well we basically as Allen mentioned in the prepared remarks we have just made another pension contribution in January per our plan. It was the expected amount. Given the returns we\u2019ve seen in the past year in the pension trust and given the contribution we\u2019ve made we\u2019re quite well funded, but we do have budgeted modest amounts for pension contributions over the next several years. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. I mean if you look out and say, okay we\u2019ve made the contribution that Gail mentioned for this year. And say all right look out from 2012 to 2015, so the back four years of our five-year plan, my expectation right now is that we\u2019ll have average annual contributions to our benefit trust in total of about $50 million to $55 million a year. So relatively modest and I hope we\u2019re assuming a return that we can certainly hit year in, year out, which is the 7.25, but I think pretty modest contributions from 2012 forward.", "Travis Miller \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You are more than welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JP Morgan Asset Management. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Leslie. How are you today?", "Leslie Rich \u2013 JP Morgan", "Great, Gale. How are you?", "Gale Klappa", "Doing well.", "Leslie Rich \u2013 JP Morgan", "Now that you\u2019re capital spending program is coming down, how are you thinking about your targeted capital structure?", "Gale Klappa", "Well I think we\u2019re looking at really in two ways. First at the utilities and I would think our in essence because our goal would be to maintain a solid single A credit rating at the utilities, I don\u2019t see going forward any material change in the capital structure in the utilities. And again, as Allen mentioned, the range that the Wisconsin Commission has historically provided would be about a 48.5% to a 53.5% equity ratio at the utilities.", "And then in terms of the entire enterprise, well, we said that we want \u2013 we at least want to get to \u2013 we at least want to again maintain solid investment grade credit rating and have a total debt-to-capital that basically supports those credit ratings. So everything in terms of our look at a capital structure is driven by where we want to be on a credit rating standpoint. But clearly, we\u2019ve now taken a lot of risk out of the business in terms of the successful execution of the construction Program. Our debt-to-total capital on an adjusted basis is now down around 54%, but I would think that we would want to keep it in that 54 to 55% range over the longer term. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah and it\u2019s the only thing, Leslie, it\u2019s \u2013 I agree with all that Gale just said. The additional thing that I would say, though, is if you look at long term obligations that we would have at the holding company level, we mentioned the $450 million obligation that matures in April of this year, April 1 I think is the exact date, so we\u2019re going to in effect pay that off over the next couple years. And then the only other long-term obligations we would have, we\u2019d have $200 million worth of unsecured debt that secures in 2033 and then the $500 million of hybrids which has the step-up in May of 2017. So we certainly will have the opportunity over the next few years to either leave those out if we wanted to and use the cash for other investments within our business, or if we wanted to have opportunities to pay those down, we\u2019d also have opportunities to pay them down.", "Gale Klappa", "And basically what I think you\u2019re hearing Allen say is that we\u2019ve got some real flexibility now that we haven\u2019t had in a very long time.", "Leslie Rich \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Leslie.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Vedula.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "Hi, couple of things. One, you went through the sales forecast that you\u2019re assuming for \u201811 and with \u201811 not being a rate case year, can you help me \u2013 how do you stand with regards to what you\u2019re seeing as a sales forecast versus what was assumed in the last case? Are you kind of caught up on it? Or are you still \u2013 is there still a gap there versus what had been assumed in the last case that you\u2019ll need to fill in somehow?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. I guess if you look at, Vedula, the 2010 normalized Electric sales and compare to in effect the forecast for 2010 approved by the Wisconsin commission when they set rates, those two lay almost exactly on top of each other. So really the run rate in 2010 on a normalized basis, very consistent with what is the test year. And so then, in effect there really isn\u2019t a notion of a 2011 test period per se, so they didn\u2019t have an approved forecast for 2011, but what our forecast of 2011 would be would actually be about 0.6% below the forecast that they had for 2010. And it varied by class. I\u2019m talking all in terms at a total company level. Some classes may be more or less than the test year.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "So do you have an estimate of a gross margin type of number that either through efficiencies or if you get fortunate with some weather, that type of thing, that basically gets filled in? At least on that in order to get to the ROE?", "Allen Leverett", "Well, I think I might have talked earlier on this call, if you have a 1% change in sales, so let\u2019s say just a 1% across all three classes up, that would an additional $16 million of margin which I think back in the envelope is probably about 28 basis points on the return, if that helps.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "Okay. Secondarily, Gale, can you talk a little bit about the carbon sequestration research project you guys have been working on one of your coal plants and what\u2019s been going on with that?", "Gale Klappa", "Oh. Sure I\u2019d be happy to. We\u2019ve concluded the experiment. And for those listening who may not be quite familiar with it, we were the first in the country to really test a new technology for carbon capture that uses chilled ammonia to attract the carbon. And we did it on a slipstream of our Pleasant Prairie Power Plant which is just north of the Illinois border. That experiment, which lasted about 18 months, was actually very successful. It achieved its operating goals for capture rate and is now, so the technology the next step now, the technology is being scaled up from where we had it by a factor of 10, at the Mountaineer power plant which is operated by American Electric Power in West Virginia.", "So actually that technology is \u2013 it really performed very well for the first time out of a laboratory setting and the first time in the field. So we feel like we\u2019ve helped to demonstrate a promising new technology. And again, the questions are will it operate as designed in terms of carbon capture as it gets scaled up to a full utility-sized plant.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "Okay. And one last item. When I was looking at the cash flow and balance sheet, can you remind me what the restricted cash is related to?", "Allen Leverett", "The restricted cash was related to the Point Beach field credits.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "Oh. Okay. Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Greetings, Paul.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Hi. How are you?", "Gale Klappa", "Doing great. How about you?", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. I wanted to ask you about the performance at Oak Creek and if it\u2019s beating, I guess, some of the benchmarks that you guys had laid down.", "Gale Klappa", "Right.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Was there any particular reason for that? I mean was there some new practice or technology or something that you guys did? Or is this just you guys beating your goals because, I don\u2019t know, being conservative goals perhaps? I don\u2019t know. I was just wondering if you could just elaborate a little bit on that.", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019ll ask Rick to give his view as well but first of all, they weren\u2019t conservative goals. I mean if you think about the guarantees that we were able to elicit from Bechtel in the contract, the heat rate guarantee, the emissions guarantees, I mean they were not weak goals. I think that the extra capacity that we\u2019re seeing is really a function of what was built in, in terms of making sure that Bechtel hit the targets. The extra capacity that was built in basically to the steam turbine and the boiler. Rick, I think that had a lot to do with the extra capacity we\u2019re getting, don\u2019t you think?", "Rick Kuester", "Yeah. I think basically it was conservatism in the design margin. When you have a contract and you have liquidated damages on the back end you don\u2019t want to miss that because it can be very expensive. So I think Bechtel did a good job of being conservative in terms of station load and working with the boiler and turbine vendor to ensure that we had adequate margins in there and we showed up on the back end with those margins. There\u2019ll be a lot of value to that for customers over the life of this project, too.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Right. So the \u2013 and the efficiency\u2019s the same thing, pretty much.", "Gale Klappa", "Yes.", "Rick Kuester", "Yep.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And so \u2013 and this all goes to ratepayers and there\u2019s no kicker or something for shareholders in this. Is that correct?", "Gale Klappa", "No. That\u2019ll all go to ratepayers and just to put a number on it for you. I think the guaranteed heat rate in the contract was $88.50 and then we\u2019re beating that by 6% and when you look at kind of the tables that are produced around the industry, a 6% improvement on an $88.50 heat rate is pretty phenomenal.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "$88.50 being the nameplate of the heat rate?", "Gale Klappa", "While being the guaranteed heat rate.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Being the guaranteed heat rate. Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Reza Hitucki with Decade. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Man, Reza. I\u2019ve never known you to be last before.", "Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade", "I know. This is quite the call. Allen, I just wanted to clarify a couple of things. There\u2019re a lot of numbers being thrown around earlier. When you mentioned that some of this extra cash will help maybe pay down some parent or reduce some parent interest drag, is that sort of already embedded in the, I guess, the negative $0.17 parent drag items for 2012?", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. And then year-over-year or what\u2019s happening is there\u2019s an $0.08 increase in the drag at the holding company. There\u2019s $0.11 of drag because of a reduced ability to capitalize interest and then going the other way there is a $0.03 benefit because you pay off a portion of the 450 senior note and then you replace a portion of it with commercial paper. So you add $0.11 increase drag because of less capitalized interest offset $0.03 with an interest benefit for a net $0.08 swing if I\u2019m making sense.", "Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade", "Well, although the apparent drag in \u201811 is $0.27 improving to $0.17 in \u201812, right?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes. So I thought your question was about \u201810 versus \u201811. I\u2019m sorry.", "Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade", "Oh, no. Sorry. The \u201811 versus \u201812 you mentioned all this extra cash. Is that \u2013 so that\u2019s paying down some parent debt is already embedded in the negative $0.27 in \u201811 as well as the negative $0.17 in \u201812.", "Allen Leverett", "Well, I haven\u2019t given any numbers for \u201812 on this call. I\u2019ve only talked about \u201811. So for \u201811 to the extent that we have cash benefits, yes it\u2019s in there. For \u201812 we haven\u2019t given an updated set of numbers for \u201812 so there would be presumably some benefit at the holding company level in 2012 that\u2019s not yet reflected in the numbers that you\u2019re looking at, because those numbers would have been from late last year before we had this bonus.", "Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade", "Oh, okay. I\u2019m sorry I thought like I said there is so many numbers I thought you reiterated the segment guidance for \u201812, like the PTF and ATC and the parent, but...", "Gale Klappa", "He was really reiterating for \u201811.", "Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade", "Oh, okay. I\u2019m sorry. And then just to clarify on the rate base, you said \u201812 is $6.7 million, before it was $7 billion, but then you mentioned that the deferred tax impact is only causing $100 million decrement in \u201812 from that $7 billion, I guess, what is the other $200 million from and then how should we think of this deferred tax effect on \u201813 rate base? Should we be reducing our \u201813 rate bases by $200 million since only 100 of the 300 is hitting in \u201812. I got a little confused there.", "Allen Leverett", "Yeah. And let me just sort of take you through. So original forecast, $7 million of worth of rate base for 2012. There\u2019s $100 million decrease for this additional bonus depreciation and then $200 million because we did better on capital spending for example we spent below the budget levels on South Oak Creek and we\u2019ve done better on working capital. So those three things take you from $7 million to $6.7 million. So bonus depreciation, working capital and CapEx. And then, Reza, as you throw forward to 2013, you\u2019re exactly right. On the margin there\u2019d be another $200 million reduction in rate base because of the buildup in deferred taxes moving to 2013.", "Reza Hitucki \u2013 Decade", "Okay. Okay. Thank you for the clarity.", "Allen Leverett", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Reza. Well, that concludes the world\u2019s longest conference call but we do appreciate you participating. If you have any other questions, Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office. Her direct line is 414-221-2592. Thanks again, everybody. Talk to you soon.

This conference is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I\u2019ll read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are made based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers.", "In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its Web site a package of detailed financial information on its 2011 first quarter results at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "Now, I\u2019d like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on our call to review the company's 2011 first quarter results. As always, let me begin by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy Management team who are here with me today. We\u2019ve Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We Generation; Jim Fleming, our venerable General Counsel; Steve Dickson, our Controller; and Pat Keyes, who has joined the company as our new Treasurer. Pat, of course, is taking the reins from Jeff West. As many of you know, Jeff retired at the end of April after 41 years of service.", "Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.72 a share for the first quarter of 2011. This compares with $0.55 a share for the first quarter a year ago.", "The uplift in earnings for this year\u2019s first quarter driven by the commercial operation of the second expansion unit at Oak Creek, which as you know was placed in service in the early morning hours of January 12.", "Across our utility operations, we experienced improved fuel recovery in the first quarter and colder winter weather. Overall, we\u2019re off to a solid start for the year.", "Now, I\u2019d like to briefly touch on the state of the economy across our service areas. Overall, electric sales to large commercial and industrial customers rose just 0.4% over the first quarter of 2010, but a deeper look inside the numbers will give you a more complete picture.", "First, as you may remember, a Chrysler engine plant in Kenosha, Wisconsin shut down last year, and that is a permanent shut down. This plant was one of our larger customers and we have factored this closing into our 2011 forecast.", "In addition, on February 2 of this year, we experienced a blizzard that shut down much of the region for a good couple of days. If you exclude these two items growth in energy used by our large commercial and industrial customers would have been in the 2% to 3% range which is right in line with our forecast, we\u2019re seeing strength in iron ore mining, especially steel production and printing, and we are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue throughout 2011.", "Now, as I mentioned on our February call, we reached a milestone event in the first quarter as construction was completed on our Power the Future plan. More than 10 years ago, we developed a roadmap that we called Power the Future. It was fundamental to the principle of energy self-sufficiency.", "Key components of achieving self sufficiency include investing in two combined cycled gas fired units at Port Washington, which is north of Milwaukee and the construction of two super critical pulverized coal units at Oak Creek which is south of the city and building a significant amount of renewable generation.", "With the commercial operation of Unit 2 at Oak Creek, we've now completed the last of the four major units that were designed to provide our customers with a state-of-the-art generation fleet and provide clean reliable energy for many years to come.", "The two natural gas fired units and the two coal fired units required a total investment of more than $2.6 billion, and we are very pleased with the efficiency and the environmental performance of these units.", "Our customers are now receiving the operational benefits of these plants and our patient stockholders are beginning to realize the full benefit of their investments.", "While we have largely completed our Power the Future effort there is clearly much more work to be done and more value to be created. We\u2019ve several major projects underway and in the pipeline. To help us meet the States renewable energy standard we are building the Glacier Hills Wind Park on more than 17,000 acres of rolling farmland approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. When completed this will be the largest wind project in the State of Wisconsin.", "It will consist of 90 turbines with the total generating capacity of 162 MW or about 1.8 MW per wind site. Construction began at Glacier Hills about a year ago and we're currently on track to begin full operation by the end of 2011. The total cost of the project is expected to be approximately $360 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction and reimbursable transmission costs.", "As you know, we\u2019ve also proposed a 50 MW cogeneration plant to be fueled with biomass at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin that is owned by the Domtar Corporation. This site, as I\u2019ve mentioned, is close to significant forest lands that are harvested in a sustainable manner, yielding the wood waste that would power the land.", "We received all the local permits necessary to move forward, and last week, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission held an open meeting on the matter. The Commission has expressed concern about the overall cost of the project and asked if Domtar would be willing to bear a greater share of the cost by paying more for the steam that the plant would produce. We and Domtar have filed a joint response actually just at noon today, and we expect the final decision from the Commission in the next week or so, and I believe that response you will find to be a very positive response.", "Finally, on the construction front, we continue to make excellent progress on a major upgrade of the air quality controls for the older coal-fired units at Oak Creek. We're investing approximately $900 million.", "I might add, this is the second largest construction project in the history of the company. Approximately, $900 million including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas de-sulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities. We expect these controls to be completed in 2012. As we speak, the project is more than 75% complete, and again, we're on time and on budget.", "Another development during the first quarter, we completed the sale to Allied Energy of our 25% interest in Edgewater Unit 5. Edgewater 5 is an existing 380 MW coal-fired unit in Eastern Wisconsin. We sold the 95 MW of capacity that we owned at Edgewater for approximately $38 million. The sale price reflected our net book value including working capital. So, as a result we did not record any book gain or any book loss.", "Turning to regulatory matters, I'd like to briefly touch on two items for you. First, late last week the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved a rate adjustment of less than 1% related to the higher fuel and purchase power cost that we\u2019re incurring this year.", "In our last general rate case, you may recall, we were allowed to file for our projected fuel and purchase power cost for the year 2011 and we filed for that increase back in September of 2010. Commission action on our request was delayed, but we\u2019re pleased that an appropriate fuel recovery rate is now in place.", "As a result of the delay, however, we expect to under collect our fuel cost by between $20 million and $25 million this year, but under the new fuel rules that went into effect this year, we estimate that our financial exposure will be limited to about $16 million, which should be the Wisconsin share and the $16 million is already factored into our guidance. The second regulatory matter is our upcoming rate filing. We expect to present a new rate proposal to the Wisconsin Commission within the next month.", "Finally, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker recently appointed a new Public Service Commissioner to fill a vacancy that occurred this spring when Commission Meyer\u2019s six-year term came to an end. The new Commissioner and the new Commission\u2019s Chairman is Phil Montgomery. Phil brings a wealth of experience to the position having worked on utility, energy, and telecommunication issues while serving for 12 years as a Wisconsin State Legislator. For a number of those 12 years, Mr. Montgomery was Chairman of the Assembly Committee on Energy and Utilities. Confirmation hearing for Commission Chairman Montgomery is expected to take place in the State Senate in May, however, he may act with full authority prior to the confirmation. Needless to say, we're pleased that the Commission is back at full strength.", "In summary, with the completion of our Power the Future plan, the company is at a very positive inflection point. We expect to have approximately $600 million of free cash flow from 2011 through 2015 and that's after retirement of $450 million of holding company debt.", "Along with a stronger balance sheet, we've clearly lowered the risk profile of this company. The majority of our construction risk is now behind us and when the point of each units were sold in 2007, we put nuclear operating and regulatory risk behind us as well.", "We're turning our efforts now to our renewable and environmental projects and continuing to upgrade the energy infrastructure of the region. We\u2019re planning a capital budget of up to $3.4 billion over the next five years or about $1.9 billion to $2 billion of net rate base growth after ongoing depreciation expense. By mid-year we plan to announce or revise dividend policy, debt reduction, share repurchases or a combination of all three with internally generated cash.", "Now in more details on our first quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011, here is a familiar face but in a slightly different chair, our new Chief Financial Officer, Rick Kuester. Rick?", "Rick Kuester", "Thank you, Gale. Before I discuss our first quarter operating results, I\u2019d like to remind you that our 2 for 1 stock split was effective on March 1, 2011. As a result of the split, we have changed the reporting of all prior earnings per share to reflect a new number of shares outstanding, so the $1.10 a share that we reported in the first quarter of 2010 is now $0.55 a share after the split.", "As Gale mentioned, our 2011 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.72 a share as compared to $0.55 a share in 2010. I\u2019ll focus on the earnings drivers at the operating income level by segment and then touch on the other income statement items. I\u2019ll also discuss cash flows in the quarter.", "Our consolidated operating income in the first quarter of 2011 was $296 million as compared to $228 million in the 2010, an increase of $68 million. As expected, our utility operating earnings were higher because of favorable fuel recoveries as compared to 2010 and earnings from our non-utility energy segment were up with the commercial operations with a second unit at Oak Creek and a full quarter of earnings from the first Oak Creek unit. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $213 million, an increase of $35 million versus 2010.", "On the positive side our revenues associated with the recovery of fuel and purchase power costs were up $24 million when compared to the first quarter of 2010. Last year we under collected fuel and purchase power costs by $23 million.", "During the first quarter this year we were in a slightly favorable position. We also experienced a significantly colder first quarter this year and we estimate that our electric and gas margins were up $22 million as compared to last year.", "On the negative side our utility O&M cost increased $10 million due to additional Power the Future costs, the timing of outages at our power plants and increased work on our distributions network.", "Operating income in the non-utility energy segment which consists primarily of the Power the Future units was up $32 million. Unit 2 at Oak Creek was placed in service on January 12, 2011 and we realized full quarter's earnings on Unit 1. Last year we only realized partial quarter's earnings on Unit 1 as it was placed in the service on February 2, 2010.", "Taking the changes for each of these segments together with a small increase in our corporate and other segment brings you back to the $68 million increase in operating income for the first quarter of 2011. During the first quarter of 2011, earnings from our investments in the American Transmission company increased just slightly over 2010.", "Net interest expense increased by $14 million, primarily because of interest expense associated with Unit 2 at Oak Creek. When we placed the unit into service, we stopped capitalizing interest associated with construction of the plant.", "We also issued $420 million of long-term debt and used the net proceeds to repay short-term debt incurred to finance the construction of Unit 2 and for other corporate purposes.", "Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $18 million because of the higher pre-tax earnings offset in part by a slightly lower effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be between 34% and 35%. Combined all of these items brings you to $171 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2011 or earnings of $0.72 per share.", "During the first quarter we generated $391 million of cash from operations which is up $87 million from the same period in 2010. Our cash earnings, which we define as net income plus depreciation and amortization, plus deferred income taxes increased by $120 million as compared to the first quarter of 2010.", "In addition to higher net income, we deferred more income tax as a result of bonus depreciation and increased depreciation expense associated with new coal units. The largest change in our uses of operating cash flows relates to our benefit plans. In the first quarter of 2011, we contributed $122 million to our qualified benefit plans no such contributions were made in 2010.", "Our total capital expenditures decreased by approximately $59 million in the first quarter of 2011 as compared to first quarter of 2010 because of the completion of the Oak Creek units. However, for the year we expect to see capital expenditures of approximately $950 million which is about a $150 million more than our 2010 expenditures.", "Over the next nine months we should see higher capital spending related to our air quality control system at South Oak Creek and the Glacier Hills wind farm. As Gale mentioned earlier, we received approximately $38 million from the sale of Edgewater 5 in March 2011.", "We also paid $61 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2011 which was 30% increase over the same period last year. The first quarter dividends equate to an annual dividend rate of $1.04 a share.", "Our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio was 53.7% as of March 31, 2011. Our adjusted calculation treats half our hardwood securities as common equity which is consistent with past presentation. We used $223 million of cash on hand at March 31, 2011 to retire long-term debt that matured on April 1, 2011.", "Adjusting for the use of cash on hand, our adjusted debt to total capital ratio was 52.5%. We\u2019re very pleased with our efforts to strengthen our balance sheet. We\u2019re using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. As shown in the earnings package that we posted on our Web site this morning, our actual first quarter retail sales of electricity increased 1.4% as compared to 2010.", "Our residential sales were helped by a colder than normal winter, and our large commercial and industrial customers are slightly below forecast because of the February 2 closure. We see some decline in average use by our residential customers. We believe this is the result of conservation efforts, but, overall, our electric sales are in line with our annual forecast.", "As we look at our natural gas sales, we saw 11.4% increase in sales, primarily because of the cold winter. We\u2019re also seeing our weather normalize natural gas sales in line with our annual forecasts.", "As we mentioned on the February call, when the second unit at Oak Creek was placed into service, we issued $420 million of senior notes in two tranches. The first tranche was a $205 million note with a coupon rate of 4.673% and the final maturity in 2031. The second tranche was a $215 million note with a coupon rate of 5.848% and the final maturity in 2041. We used the net proceeds to repay debt incurred to finance the construction of Unit 2 at Oak Creek and for other corporate purposes.", "As discussed earlier, on April 1, 2011, we retired $450 million of long-term debt with $223 million of existing cash in commercial paper borrowings. Later this year, we expect Wisconsin Electric to issue approximately $300 million of long-term debt to help fund its construction program.", "Our 2011 earnings guidance remains the same as what we provided to you on our February conference call. We expect our earnings for 2011 to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.10 per share. While our first quarter earnings exceeded our forecast range because of favorable weather, we still have nine more months of weather ahead of us.", "Before I turn things back over to Gale, I would like to briefly discuss our earnings outlook for the second quarter. As a starting point, our 2010 second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.37 a share, adjusted for the 2 for 1 stock split.", "When we look at our utility earnings, we expect to see a decline in operating income on a quarter-over-quarter basis because of favorable weather in 2010 and higher O&M cost in 2011.", "Last year, we had an early summer and benefitted from some cooling out in June. This year our forecast assumed normal weather. However, we expect increased earnings from the second Oak Creek unit to offset the lower earnings from our utility in the second quarter.", "In the past, we said that Unit 2 should contribute $0.02 a month pre-split or $0.01 a month post-split. As a result, we are expecting second quarter 2011 earnings to be in the $0.36 per share to $0.39 per share range or flat with the prior year.", "With that I\u2019ll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Rick, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Caris & Company. Please state your question.", "Andy Levi - Caris & Company", "Gentlemen, how are you?", "Gale Klappa", "Fine, how are you, Andy?", "Andy Levi - Caris & Company", "I\u2019m doing, all right. Just two very quick questions and I may have missed the first one. O&M is down a lot for the quarter. What was the reason, why?", "Gale Klappa", "Actually, we can let Rick and Steve get into the mechanics if you like. So if you really look at utility O&M, it was up about $10 million in the quarter, the remaining impact of the O&M that you see on the income statement is really because of the way the mechanics of the lease payments work between the Utility and We Power. I think, because of this year, we're going to have an unusual year. The one thing you really need to focus on is the utility, O&M and the utilities. Steve, do you want to give us a color on that?", "Steve Dickson", "Yes, thanks, Gale. Andy, as you point out, overall in a consolidated level, O&M is down about $22 million and as Gale said that the Utility, it's up about $10 million. The difference which is about $30 million decline relates to the elimination of intercompany revenues and expense. And as I remember it We Power builds the utility for the lease payment. So We Power records revenue and the Utility records expense. This year We Power with the Unit 2 coming on line had about $30 million more of revenue and therefore, on the consolidation entries, we eliminated $30 million more revenue at We Power and $30 million more expense on a consolidated basis, so it's an accounting anomaly, which shows why the O&M is down. Does that make sense, Andy?", "Andy Levi - Caris & Company", "Sure, it does. Thank you very much, and then I have other quick question.", "Rick Kuester", "Andy, lesson for everyone here for this year if you want to look at the O&M trends really look and we'll break this out for each quarter, really look at the Utility O&M.", "Andy Levi - Caris & Company", "Got it. And then on the stock buyback and/or dividend increase and/or I guess was a debt pay down was that the third thing that you were talking about. Just timing on that, as far as hearing from you guys on that, will that be in the second quarter call or could that come before, what are you guys thinking?", "Rick Kuester", "It\u2019ll definitely come by June and we\u2019re working through obviously all of our final analysis. We obviously also want to have our regulatory scheduled Board meetings and so you\u2019ll expect an answer from us by June.", "Andy Levi - Caris & Company", "When is your Board meeting in June, is that something you can share with us today?", "Rick Kuester", "We\u2019ve a Board meeting coming up soon. We also need by the way a final decision on our proposed biomass investment in Rothschild, the Domtar investment. So that\u2019s another factor that we\u2019re waiting for, but you\u2019ll be hearing from us in the not too distant future.", "Andy Levi - Caris & Company", "Got it, thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Thanks, Andy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.", "Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann", "Good afternoon. Would you mind elaborating a little more on the joint filing with PSCW related to the Domtar biomass cost I apologize, business I haven\u2019t had a chance to read the filing?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure. In essence the filing that we made at noon and I understand why you wouldn\u2019t have had a chance to read it, it was noon central time. The filing in the filing Domtar has agreed to, in essence, pay more for the steam that would be produced by the unit, and for background this would be a 50 MW plant. The plant would produce both steam to power Domtar\u2019s paper mill operations and renewable electricity for the grid.", "And one of the major questions that the Commissioners had during their open meeting last week was, could there be a different allocation of cost between the cost that go to electric customers and the cost that Domtar would accept for the production of steam. And so Domtar has agreed to, what we think is, a very major price change. We\u2019ll let Allen cover the details for you.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, Brian, just to put some numbers around it. What Domtar agreed to was a 20% increase in the rate that they pay for steam. Now, when you sort of track that through the implication then for our customers that translates into about a 7% reduction in the cost of the project took to our customers.", "We believe that based on the conversation at the Commission last week, we believe this puts the cost of the project as compared to a wind project within a range that at least one of the Commissioners was looking for. So, as Gale mentioned, we would expect the decision in the near future from the Commission, but from a practical standpoint, we really need a decision by May 15 if we\u2019re going to move forward with the project. That\u2019s a high level summary.", "Gale Klappa", "Allen is exactly right. We actually need an order by May 15. In that, if we\u2019re going to go forward with this project, we have a construction schedule that we have to meet and federal production tax credits related to biomass that right now at any rate expire at the end of 2013. If we don\u2019t qualify, if we couldn\u2019t get the plant on line by the end of 2013, and if we couldn\u2019t therefore qualify for the production tax credits, it obviously changes the economics of the plant and not for the better. So, we think the Commission understands that and we\u2019re looking for a decision here in the very near future.", "Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann", "Okay, great. And then this $600 million of cumulating free cash flow through 2014, does that assume the biomass plant moves forward and the expenditures are included in the CapEx calculation there? Or would that price of the biomass plant eat into the $600 million?", "Gale Klappa", "Rick?", "Rick Kuester", "No, Brian. The $600 million assumes that we build the biomass project. If we don't build it, that will be additional equity available. That's a total $255 million investment, so about $125 million of additional cash flow would be available.", "Gale Klappa", "That's because obviously of the 50-50 capital structure.", "Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Bank of America.", "Steve Fleishman - Bank of America", "A couple of questions. First, on the Chrysler plant shut down, do you have a sense if we excluded just that plant kind of what all industrial sales would have done without that impact?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes. Matter of fact, I do. It's a very good question. Let me give you a little bit of analysis. The analysis I have look at the four major and not all of them are major, but we had four plant shut downs that we believe are going to be reasonably permanent shut downs. There was the Chrysler engine plant in Kenosha. And then we have the Delphi Automotive Operations in Oak Creek. We had White Pine up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, which was a copper refiner, and then we have the NewPage paper mills. Paper mills owned in Northern Wisconsin by NewPage. All four of those shut downs and closings we have factored into our forecast.", "Now, looking at how that relates, about 25% of our industrial demand and some of our largest customers are in the first quarter of this year their usage is above prerecession levels. The remaining 75% of our industrial grouping of customers, if you take out those four shutdowns, they are about 5% below, as a group about 5% below precession levels. But that's kind of the picture. We\u2019ve, obviously, factored in these shutdowns in our 2011 forecast.", "Steve Fleishman - Bank of America", "A couple of other questions. The $16 million of net drag on fuel from the delay on the fuel case, was that in your initial guidance or is that kind of incremental to your initial guidance?", "Gale Klappa", "We had assumed there would be some drag because of the delay in getting an order from the Commission. So, it's really not incremental.", "Steve Fleishman - Bank of America", "And then I know you had mentioned one potential use of cash might be, for example, the fact that the state may be looking to sell some of their power assets?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes.", "Steve Fleishman - Bank of America", "Is there any update on that issue?", "Gale Klappa", "Very good question, Steve, and that is the potential use of cash. The State of Wisconsin or the Walker administration has expressed an interest in selling a number of the plants and steam heating power islands that currently are operated by the State of Wisconsin across college campuses and the biggest, obviously, would be the UW campus in Madison. It will require for the state to move forward with any sale.", "A piece of legislation would be required to be passed by both the State Senate and the assembly, and my understanding is that the Walker administration is hoping to introduce that legislation sometime this summer. So, there won't be any immediate movement until a piece of legislation is passed and signed by the governor, but our understanding is the Walker administration would like to move forward with the sale of those assets.", "Steve Fleishman - Bank of America", "One last question, just your take on the EPA proposed air toxics rules and how that affects your capital plan for the remaining non-cleaned up coal plants and the like?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure, absolutely. I'll ask Allen to add his thoughts on this as well. Some background, Steve, might be very helpful. We really see very little impact on customer electric rates or our capital plan between now and 2015 as a result of all the new EPA regulations that have been proposed. That may surprise you because so many utilities are indicating that they are going to see huge capital increases and huge cost increases from the need to comply with these proposed rules, but there are three very good reasons why we do not see that kind of impact. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes. Just as background Steve. Of course, the first reason is, 10 years ago, the company made the decision to retire old coal, build new natural gas plants, build new coal plants. So, of course, those are the Port Washington plants and the Oak Creek plants. So, that's the first driver of why we are where we are. Second, you may remember in 2003, we entered into a consent decree with EPA, which drove controls at many of our other major plants.", "And then, finally, we as a company unlike many others, we don't have ash impoundments. We\u2019ve 100% beneficial reuse of the ash that comes from the combustion of the coal. So, we don't really see much many impact from EGU MACT or IB MACT on the company. The only three plants that we see they are mainly impacts on down the road, you have heard us talk about our Valley and our Milwaukee County power plants which are actually CoGen plants that produce steam as well as electricity and an electric plant that we have in the UP.", "We see little impact on those units there could be a small amount of investment of those units because of EGU and or IB MACT, but the bigger impacts if there are going to be impacts than those plants would be out in the 2017 timeframe. They wouldn\u2019t be driven by MACT, they would be driven by NAAQS, the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for SO2 in particular now, but again, we wouldn\u2019t see impacts there if any until 2017. So it\u2019s probably more than you wanted to know, but that\u2019s kind of where we see ourselves positioned.", "Gale Klappa", "Steve, speaking more than you wanted to know you are probably seeing some of the national studies that have been done now that would indicate that the average price of electricity in the country maybe going up by as much as 20%, because of these proposed EPA rules. We might see 1% to 2% increase our best guess. So that gives you an example of how well we are positioned from the environmental standpoint in terms of complying with even the new proposed rule. So I think, this is going to materially help our competitive position.", "Steve Fleishman - Bank of America", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "The return on capital, you are waiting on Domtar and we are in a kind of a period where things are getting better but things aren\u2019t perfect. I\u2019m going to ask a question I think, your entire investor base probably won\u2019t love which is what\u2019s the rush?", "Rick Kuester", "Well I don\u2019t feel like we are in a rush, I really don\u2019t. We've taken I think,, very good time to do the proper analysis, we will have sooner or later within the next week or two I believe a decision from the Wisconsin Commission on Domtar, we\u2019ve laid out $3.4 billion or up to $3.4 billion capital plan for the next five years. So, Michael, I think, all of the elements are in place for us to really have a very good understand of what our earnings potential, our investment opportunities and our cash flows look like. So, I don\u2019t sense that we\u2019re in a rush at all.", "Allen Leverett", "I\u2019d just add onto that Michael, in other way to interpret your question would be, why now and what's happened in the first part of this year, is that we\u2019ve gotten more clarity on the EPA rule, so we kind of know what the exposure is there. We sold Edgewater 5 which was going to be an investment that those are going to be required to make from an air quality control standpoint. So, that\u2019s no longer an uncertainty out there, and we finished the last unit at Oak Creek, so we\u2019ve got a number of things resolved. So, I think, the timing actually is pretty good, if you look at the issues that we were facing a few months ago versus the issues that we\u2019re facing now in terms of capital expenditure.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. One other\u2026", "Gale Klappa", "Michael, one other point to add onto what Rick said, I personally think it\u2019s important for our investor base to understand, it\u2019s very clearly where what our philosophy is on our dividend payout ratio as well. I mean, we\u2019re entering, as I mentioned in the earlier comments, I think, the company is at a very positive inflection point, but clearly our dividend payout ratio is below our peers, and I think, it\u2019s important to clarify for our investors going forward at a minimum what our goals are related to our dividend payout ratio.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "No, and that\u2019s makes it understand synonymously over the last 5 to 7, 5 to 10 years, you guys have been among the best in terms of stewards of shareholder and bondholder capital. One follow-up related to capital structure, but just in general in your discussions with the new Chairman, what are you getting in terms of potential direction for state energy policy in Wisconsin for the next 3 to 5 years?", "Gale Klappa", "Really, Phil has just gotten in the chair. I think, he has been pretty busy trying with the other Commissioners to work off the backlog of items that they had really built up when they were short of Commissioner. So I don't think Phil has had a great opportunity yet to sit down and think about energy policy for the state. He did say though during the last open meeting that he was part of the crafting of the renewable energy standard for 2015 and supports that standard. So, I think, the first and only comment that we've really seen from Phil so far is his support for the 2015 energy standard, renewable energy standard.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "What does that then mean if Domtar doesn't get approved?", "Gale Klappa", "That's when we will have some conversations and try to seek some guidance from the Commissioners, because the truth of the matter is, if Domtar is approved it will get us to where we need to be for 2015 and 2016. I mean, that would be the last major investment we would need to make in the near-term in renewables to meet that 2015 and 2016 standard. Without that then we've got some decisions to make and in our first step if they decide that Domtar is just too expensive a proposal, our next step would be to sit down and work with the Commissioners and get some guidance, and frankly work with the Walker administration as well. I know that the governor would want to have some say in that thinking.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it, okay, thank you, guys, much appreciate it.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome, Michael. Take care.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "I was hoping we could continue on the Domtar topic. I know it's timely we\u2019ll have a decision here shortly, but I didn\u2019t hear the commentary that the PSC made but just judging from your reaction you took some solace in the fact that with the price cut they would compare that or would look economically similar to a wind asset. I was just hoping you could elaborate on that solace, simply because it seemed as if a lot of the desire for wind in the state quite frankly lost a lot of its backing with the new governor. So I'm just wondering if that's economic we would feel more comfortable with or that\u2019s something that obviously will be determined in the ultimate decision, but just tell us how the wind economics or the comparison with wind economics makes you feel more comfortable?", "Gale Klappa", "I think, there is one very clear reason why it makes me feel more comfortable and that is the former Chairman and current Commissioner Eric Callisto during the open discussions with the other commissioners said that he would like to be able to see this renewable alternative, meaning the Domtar co-generation plant that we are proposing. He was concerned that it looked like based on staff analysis that this proposal was more expensive than generic wind. He said gosh, he would feel comfortable he said, if we could have some kind of, as he put it wind bogie against which to compare.", "Now, when we look at the staff assumption on generic wind and the cost of generic wind, there are a couple of items here that I think, are worth pointing out. The staff's analysis on the cost of generic wind assumed that the federal production tax credit for wind would go on for a very long time. We don't think it's prudent to make that assumption because under the current law the federal production tax credit for wind expires at the end of 2012.", "And then when you factor that into the fact that generic wind may not represent the real cost of building wind in Wisconsin in light of the flux that the state is in regarding the citing rules. I mean, we think the real generic cost of wind can be materially higher than what the staff indicated. And then if you couple that with price reduction that Allen described from what Domtar and we filed at noon today, you get much, much closer. In fact, we think and hope we\u2019ve achieved what Commissioner Callisto was looking for which was a proposal that would be quite close to the cost of generic wind. Guys, would you like to add anything?", "Rick Kuester", "No. I think you've covered it Gale. If you kind of stand back and look at it, it\u2019s not really possible to build the generic wind project that would be compared to because if it\u2019s a Greenfield project, because one, citing rules aren\u2019t clear, two, the production tax credit expires one year early than biomass. So, I think, by bringing the numbers closer we\u2019ve been responsive to the Commission.", "Gale Klappa", "There\u2019s another factor here, the area where we\u2019re proposing to build the biomass plant, which is a suburb of Wausau in Northern Wisconsin. Like all areas, that area can benefit from jobs and there is a very strong job protection and job creation story associated with this plant that we think should also play into the mix here.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "No. That\u2019s very helpful. Maybe seizing on the national question, from where you indicated if it doesn\u2019t go forward you\u2019d like to have discussions with the Walker administration. Where do you think their desires might be on where you might fill if need be, and you certainly would have to under the renewable standard where he would like you to sort of focus?", "Gale Klappa", "I'd hate to pre-judge what the Governor might say on this, but clearly in the past particularly in this kind of economic climate, he has focused on near-term cost to the customer. So one option and I'm not suggesting this would be the option, we would have to get the proper inputs, but one option which is allowed under the law is the filing of RAM. The law says that if it is not practical or if it is excessive in cost to meet the 2015 standard, then a utility could file for an of RAM. None have done so at this point and we certainly would not need to do so assuming we could move forward with the Rothschild of Domtar biomass project.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "Last question on Domtar, how much is in the CapEx budget for '11? I think, you answered that question and it just went by me too quick.", "Rick Kuester", "About $100 million this year.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "About $100 million this year?", "Rick Kuester", "$255 million.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "Great. And my last question, on the under collection, the fuel under recoveries for the balance of this year, how do they flow over the remaining three quarters, understanding it's just about $16 million of financial exposure?", "Gale Klappa", "Right, we're about even now on fuel recovery going into Q2. Steve or Rick, do you have that flow for the final three quarters?", "Rick Kuester", "As Gale said, basically our cost of fuel was right on top of our collection rate in the first quarter. As Gale said, we expect to be $16 million. We expect to hit the threshold. If you look in the next couple of quarters, we expect to under recovering the second, but most of it would be in the third quarter. That's probably when we would exceed the $16 million amount and start to edge up toward the $20 million to $25 million that Gale mentioned.", "And then in the fourth quarter, we typically claw back some of that that we\u2019ve lost in the third quarter because of the higher cost of power during the summer. So at the end of the year we expect to be in that $20 million to $25 million under collected, but we're capped at $16 million based on how the fuel rules work.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "How much would be in that 36 to 39 you gave Rick for the second quarter, it\u2019s probably pretty small number I know but\u2026", "Steve Dickson", "Basically, on the fuel recoveries, we'll under collect anywhere from $5 million to $7 million in the second quarter and that amount is comparable to 2010. So we don't expect earnings varying in some 2010 to 2011 related to fuel in Q2.", "Jay Dobson - Wunderlich Securities", "Great, perfect, thank you so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ted Heyn with Catapult.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "I had a few quick questions, first on just on the under recoveries, so the $16 million represents basically the 2% bandwidth, the 16 is cap of the earnings exposure?", "Gale Klappa", "You've nailed it.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "Just quickly on weather, how much above normal was at this quarter and how much does it contribute?", "Gale Klappa", "In terms of average temperatures Q1 was about 10% colder than last year and Steve how much colder than normal?", "Steve Dickson", "6%, colder than normal, last year it was 4% warmer than normal.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "Do you have a dollar impact or gross margin impact from being above normal?", "Steve Dickson", "On electric side we think that compared to normal our electric margins which is revenues minus fuel were helped by about $7 million and on the gas side, our gas margins were held at about $8 million, so in total about $15 million.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "So, 15 ahead but you also have the 16 of fuel under recovery so kind of net-net on a normalized basis you are kind of\u2026", "Gale Klappa", "No. The 16 of fuel under recovery was already in our guidance", "Rick Kuester", "We fully collected on fuel this quarter. That 16 actually fell through till third quarter.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "I guess I was thinking as when I do a bridge from '11 to '12 those two things should wash each other out?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes from '11 and '12, yes exactly.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "And then on the Domtar, the filing mentioned that they increased their capital allocation by $22 million. Does that change the amount of dollars you would spend or is that\u2026..", "Gale Klappa", "No. All it does and again you need to think about this as about $255 million capital investment and then the questions becomes what share of the cost of that investment and what share of the operating costs would be allocated to Domtar for taking the steam for their paper mill operations and what share would go to electric customers for the renewable electricity that would go to the grid? This is all a question about allocation of the total cost not about change of total cost.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "So, if your revised proposal was approved, the spend would still be $255 million?", "Gale Klappa", "You got it.", "Rick Kuester", "It's just the rate that they pay for the steam.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "It's just the rate. And then just finally I think, that there is some movement to try to change the RPS standard to allow hydropower for Manitoba to potentially count. If that were to happen could you talk maybe about how \u2013 what the investment opportunities would be for you there?", "Gale Klappa", "I'm not sure there is an investment opportunity there in terms of that change or any Wisconsin utility because what is being proposed is particularly if I want other Wisconsin utilities is that, in essence they would sign a purchase power agreement for new hydro power that would be developed in Canada to be imported into Wisconsin. So, there is no real construction investment opportunity there for the hydropower itself, but as Rick is pointing out, there may be a transmission in this.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "Okay. So, maybe ATC would have some opportunity?", "Gale Klappa", "That is entirely possible.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "But that\u2019s probably longer term in nature.", "Gale Klappa", "Ted, I would be thinking this is a post 2015 type of matter, because first of all the new hydro facilities aren\u2019t even built yet.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "Got you. Okay. Thanks a lot for all the help.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Take care, Ted.", "Ted Heyn - Catapult", "You too. Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sarah Akers with Wells Fargo.", "Sarah Akers - Wells Fargo", "Hey, good afternoon. I just had a quick clarification question on the $600 million of free cash flow. First, does that include the sale proceeds from Edgewater 5 and second, does it include the impact of the DOE settlement, which I believe was about $45 million?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes and no. It includes the Edgewater 5 sale proceeds, but the proceeds from our settlement with the federal government regarding the extra cost we incurred at Point Beach on spent nuclear fuel, those dollars are in an Al Gore lock-box down the street in a bank and those dollars will be completely returned to customers overtime, and so they\u2019re not counted in our cash flow assumptions.", "Sarah Akers - Wells Fargo", "Got it, okay, thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Sarah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi, good afternoon. Just to follow-up on what you just talked about with further, so is that the $45 million of restricted cash then that we're seeing on the balance sheet?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes, $45 million.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "And then lower on the balance sheet, I noticed the material supplies inventories are about $100 million lower which I assume it\u2019s also been part of the working capital gain that we're seeing on the cash flow statement. I just wondered if you could talk about what is going on with that.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, its gas and coal inventories that Steve can talk about that.", "Steve Dickson", "Yes, the balance sheet is comparing December 31st to March 31st and at the end of December we had a significant amount of gas in storage and we pulled that out at the end of the year. So, we had the same decline last year. The number this year is about $50 million more because March was significantly coldish so we would show more in gas and storage. In addition we were able to reduce coal inventories down and so those are the two big drivers.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Is there anything else then that's driving that working capital gain $150 million on the cash flow statement?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, the balance depreciation is having an effect on that Dan.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, the increase in the deferred taxes.", "Gale Klappa", "Yes.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Was that 60 odd million you see?", "Allen Leverett", "Yes", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "And then I think, you mentioned you're expecting to file for a rate increase in the next month or so.", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "I was curious what your current ROE, earned ROE is and then are there any other items driving that, that you expect that'll drive that request beyond ROE impact?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, for all of 2010, our earned ROE was very close to the allowed ROE at the utility. So, again, we performed very close to the allowed ROE at the utility last year. Of course, the way Wisconsin regulation works, the Commission uses and ask us to file a two-year forward-looking test year. We project our expenses, our O&M expense, our fuel expenses, our capital costs for, in this case, 2012 and 2013. The big driver of the rate proposal that we will file is really completing construction and placing into service about $1.2 billion of new assets that have already been approved by the Commission.", "In specific, the two large projects that would be the big drivers would be the completion of the air quality controls of the older existing Oak Creek units. Remember, I mentioned that's a $900 million capital expenditure, and then the completion later this year we believe of the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which is another $360-ish million.", "Rick Kuester", "$360 million and $370 million.", "Gale Klappa", "You put those two together and that's $1.2 billion of new capital that once placed into service needs to be reflected in customer rates. So that would be the big driver of our rate proposal that we expect to file in the next few weeks.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "And then the last thing I was curious is, it looks like the residential usage was up about 1.5% and the small commercial was up about 2.5%. If you strip out the weather impact, what would those have looked like?", "Gale Klappa", "You strip out the weather impact, against 20-year average weather, you would see residential actually being down slightly. You would see small commercial and industrial up about 0.5%. You would see large commercial and industrial about flat, and total large commercial and industrial up about four-tenth of one percent.", "Rick Kuester", "Dan, one other thing, on the $45 million that restricted cash in the DoD settlement that would be returned to customers net of the cost to achieve. That was about a 10-year process where we were suing the federal government. So, there are costs associated with that. So, just point of clarification.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "What's the timeframe for returning there?", "Gale Klappa", "Actually, it's certainly up to the Commission when they would like to have and over what timeframe they would like to have those dollars flow back to customers, but we will propose an option for the Commission in the (inaudible) filing.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay, thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome, Dan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey, guys, Rick, a modeling question real quickly. What is left in 2011 in terms of deferred income tax or really bonus depreciation for you to take and even deferred income taxes separate from bonus depreciation, meaning the deferred income tax benefit you get from Oak Creek?", "Rick Kuester", "We said all along we\u2019ve got about $100 million worth of bonus depreciation impacts in 2011.", "Gale Klappa", "Most of that's to come this year yet.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Meaning very little of that is what showed in the first quarter?", "Rick Kuester", "About $60 million showed in the first quarter I believe.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "So, another $40 million for the rest of the year?", "Gale Klappa", "All right, Michael, thank you.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, guys. Much appreciate it.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions.", "Gale Klappa", "Very good, well, that concludes our conference call for today.

Thank you for waiting, and welcome Wisconsin Energy\u2019s Quarterly Conference Call. This conference is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are made based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, I would like to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review the company\u2019s 2011 second quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy Management team who are here with me today.", "We have Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Fleming, our generous General Counsel; Pat Keyes, our Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, our Controller.", "Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 a share for the second quarter of 2011. This compares with $0.37 a share for the comparable period last year.", "Our second quarter 2011 were driven by earnings from our $668 million investment in the second expansion unit at expansion unit at Oak Creek, which as you know came on line in January this year. Overall, we are quite pleased with our second quarter and our year-to-date performance.", "Now I would like to focus for a few minutes on the economy across our service area. After nearly double-digit rebound in 2010, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by a little more than 1% in the first half of the 2011.", "When we take a look a little deeper inside the numbers, we see that the demand destruction from five large plant closings during the great recession is now being largely offset by modest growth and recovery in other sectors of the region\u2019s economy. For example, we are seeing strength in iron ore mining, specialty steel production and in the paper and printing industries. And from talking with our largest customers, we are cautiously optimistic that the recovery will continue throughout the remainder of the year.", "Now, when we look at our residential customers, we see flat sales for the first half of this year compared to the first six months of 2010. As you know, however, the Midwest was in the grip of old-fashioned heat wave and residential and commercial dimension was strong. In fact the peak demand on our system rose to within 2.5% of our all-time record one-hour demand.", "One other point about recent heat wave, I\u2019m pleased to report that our for new power the future units, the two natural-gas fired units at Port Washington and the two coal-fire units at Oak Creek performed very well. Before units were online the throughout the hot spell, they were war course units. Helping to meet customer needs in a very cost-effective manner. As a result, there were no runouts, no blankouts, no threats of curtailment and no long calls to interrupt our industrial customers.", "The experience reaffirms our decision to complete our Power the Future plan, investing in critical energy infrastructure to ensure the liability from Wisconsin and the upper peninsula of Michigan. And now I would like to update you on the three significant construction projects that we have underway. The 50 Megawatt biomass plant in northern Wisconsin, the glazier hills wind park, north-east of Madison and the air quality control upgrade of original Oak Creek units.", "As a mention on previous call, 50 megawatt cogeneration plant to be fueled with biomass at a paper mill site in Northern Wisconsin, which is owned by Domtar Corporation was proposed by our company really know almost 2 years ago generation plan will help us to diversify our renewable energy portfolio. We will have the ability, as you know, to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology will clearly benefit the existing paper mill.", "In the second quarter of this year the Wisconsin Public Service Commission gave the final approval for the project. The project was also approved by our board and by the Domtar Corporation Board of Directors.", "In late June we broke around and began construction. The investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between 245 and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. At the early stage of the project, we are on schedule and on budget to meet the completion day by the end of 2013.", "The other large renewable project on our pipeline is the Glacier Hills Wind Park, the 162 MW energy center located approximately 45 miles northeast of Madison. We\u2019re now erecting 90 wind towers across more than 15,000 acres of rolling farmland and we\u2019re scheduled to complete the project on time and on budget by the end of this year.", "Our current estimate of the capital cost for Glacier Hills is $361 million. This estimate does not include allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs. The Glacier Hills Wind Park and the biomass projects are two key components that will allow us to meet Wisconsin\u2019s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015.", "To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity we supply with renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 20% in 2015 at a state-wide level. The standard also sets targets for each of the Wisconsin utilities using an historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.", "As I mentioned, when the complete the two large renewable projects, we now have under construction, we will be well positioned to meet the 2015 standard. I should point out however that we will be depleting our bank of our renewable credits after 2015 and as a result, we expect to need additional renewable capacity by the year 2017.", "Finally, we are well along on the air quality control upgrade at the original coal-fired units on the Old Creek site. The older units at Oak Creek are among the most efficient base load units in the mid-west. So the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet flue gas desulfurization and selective catalytic reduction facilities.", "We expect the new controls to be completed in 2012. Construction is progressing very well, the project now is about 83% complete and once again we are on time and on budget.", "And now I\u2019d like to briefly mention where we stand on the Wisconsin and Michigan regulatory fronts on May 26 we filed an application with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission requesting no net increase in base rates for the year 2012. Our proposal includes the following key items. First authorization to suspend the amortization of a $148 million of regulatory assets in 2012.", "Second authorization to include $148 million of the carrying costs and depreciation, for the air quality controls of that will creek and for the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Third a fuel cost plan for 2012, and finally a one-time credit to customers of $26 million. The credits stand for most Wisconsin Electric\u2019s settlement and spread nuclear field litigation in the US Department of energy.", "We also ask for the authority to re-open the rate proceeding next year, for new rates that would be effective in 2013. Now keep in mind that under a traditional rate case, we would have filed for a base rate increase of approximately 6% for Wisconsin Electric\u2019s retail customers in the year 2012.", "We also said that if the commission was not comfortable with our creative approach. We\u2019d proceed with a traditional rate case. After reviewing our request, the commission stab issued a memo last week with several alternatives for the commission to consider. A stab asked for final comments from all the parties in the case by the end of the day tomorrow July, 29. So as to think about our request and about the stab memo. There are several things to keep in mind. First, the stab ordered of our projected revenue needs points as we expected to a revenue deficiency for 2012.", "Using the stab numbers, we believe the revenue deficiency would be approximately $100 million in 2012. And that\u2019s before any company \u2013 to the stab\u2019s proposed adjustments. Company would take place in any additional rate proceedings. This clearly implies that a traditional rate case would result in rate increase in 2012.", "Secondly, we offered, what we believe was a unique approach to keeping base rate flat for customers during the economic recovery. And finally the company has big ability to file a full rate case at any point in time. So after assessing the stab memo, we believe the only viable alternatives are the two past, we\u2019re originally proposed.", "A zero based at increased by 2012 with our recommended approach or a traditional rate case. We expect to this constant commission to decide in August. Starting that to our Michigan operations. Earlier this month we be filed $17.5 million rate increase request with Michigan Public Service Commission.", "The request is recover from a Michigan customers, they\u2019ll provide a share of renewable generation, environment controls and costs associated with the unit 2 at Oak Creek. These costs are already by the way being recovered in the Wisconsin jurisdiction in Michigan recovery takes place only after an asset is completed and placed into commercial service. As provided for under Michigan law, we planned to self-implement 7.7 million of our rate increase request in January of 2012 we expect the Michigan commission to rule on the entire request by July of next year.", "In summary, at the halfway point of 2011, the companies performing at a high-level and our power in the future investments are clearly providing tangible benefits for our customers and our stock holders. And while we systematically look for solid utility investments in the future that we meet our risk profile, we\u2019re pleased that our board is approved two measures that will deliver additional shareholder value.", "As I mentioned in May we have approval to repurchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock between now and the end of 2013. The board has also approved a dividend policy that will target a 60% payout ratio by the year 2015. This policy of course should support dividend increases of about 8% to 9% a year for the next several years. And now with more details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2011, here\u2019s our Chief Financial Officer Rick Kuester. Rick?", "Frederick Kuester", "Thanks Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2011 second quarter earnings from continuing operation were $0.41 per share. The results were slightly better than our plan because of lower than the expected benefits cost and a favorable adjustment related to income tax expense. Although, I\u2019ll focus my comments in operating income from continuing operations by segment and then touch on other income statement items, I did want to mention that we also recorded a gain of $0.05 per share from discontinued operations. As a result of the resolution of several state and federal tax issues. I will also discuss year-to-date cash flows and guidance for the third quarter and the full year.", "Our consolidated operating income in the second quarter of 2011 was $174 million as compared to $163 million in last year\u2019s second quarter, an increase of $11 million. We clearly benefited from a full quarter\u2019s earnings from the second expansion unit at (inaudible). Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $88 million which is down $10 million from the prior year. As we discuss on our last call we expect our utility earnings to be down this quarter because of warmer than normal second quarter in 2010 and increased operating cost in 2011.", "Colder weather negatively impacted this quarter results but our calls came in slightly better than anticipated. We estimate that a cooler April and May helped our gas margins by $11 million as compared to second quarter 2010. However we experienced a mild June this year and we estimate weather reduced our electrical margins $16 million as compared to second quarter last year. When we combine the electric and gas margins. We experienced to decline of $5 million on the year-over-year basis due to weather. The other significant factor in packing utility operating income for the quarter relates to the collection of fuel revenues.", "On the net basis, we were $9 million worse in the second quarter of 2011 as compared with last year. When you take the weather and fuel recovery together, with all other items you see the $10 million decline in the operating income at the utility.", "Our operating income in the non-utility energy segment which includes repower came in as expected. We saw higher operating income of $21 million that was driven by the commercial operation of unit 2 Widow Creek.", "We would expect this favorable variance to continue in the third and the fourth quarter. Taking the changes for these two segments together, you arrive at $11 million increase in operating income for the second quarter of 2011.", "During the second quarter of 2011 earnings from our investment in the American transmission Company total just over $15 million. Other income increased by $5 million because of higher APDC on our utility construction projects.", "Primarily the air quality control system for the elder Creek units and the Glacier Hills went par. Net interest expense increased by $4 million primarily because of interest expense associated with the second unit at Oak Creek.", "In January we issued $420 million of long-term debt, to replace short-term debt used to finance the construction of the unit 2.", "In addition once unit 2 achieves commercial operation, we no longer capitalized interest on the construction work in the progress. While we saw increased interest expense at to the power level, our holding company interest expense a decline as we retired $450 million or 6.5% long-term debt on April 1 of this year.", "Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $2 million because of higher pre-tax earnings, offset by slightly lower effective tax rate. During the second quarter, our income tax expenses was reduced by $2.2 billion because of our favorable resolution of uncertain tax decision in our continuing operations. For the year we expect our effective tax rate to be between 34% and 35%.", "Combining all of these items brings you to get $98 of net income from continuing operation for the second quarter of 2011 or earnings of $.41 per share.", "During the first six months of 2011 we generated $649 million of cash from operations on a GAAP basis, which is up $225 million in the same period in 2010.", "Our strong cash flows were driven by higher net income and a higher non-cash charge of related to depreciation and deferred income tax. On an adjusted basis our cash of operation increased by $106 million. The adjustment related to how GAAP treat changes in restrictive cash as in inventing activity, while we look at this as an operating on item.", "Our 2011 cash flows were also reduce by $122 million, because of contributions to our benefit plans. No such contributions were made in 2010. Our total capital expenditures were approximately $347 million in the first six months of 2011. And we are forecasting annual capital expenditure this year of approximately $950 million. The majority of our capital expenditures are in the utility business and the largest project the air quality control system at the Oak Creel site and the Glacier Hills in Wind Park.", "We also paid $122 million in common dividends in first half 2011, which was a 30% increase over the same period last year. On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-cap ratio was 55.2% and we were at 52.4% on an adjusted basis. These ratios were an improvement over our December 31, 2010 levels of 56.9% and 54.1% respectively. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We might see a slight uptick these ratios by the end of the year as we fulfill our capital budget commitments and repurchase shares.", "However, we expect our year-end ratios to be well under the prior year numbers. Consistent with our past practice, we are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Through July 25, 2011, we have repurchased approximately 650,000 common shares at an average price of approximately $31.40 under the $300 million share repurchase program that Gale mentioned.", "We will update you each quarter on the progress of our share repurchase program.", "As Gale mentioned, we are cautiously optimistic that the investment recovery will continue through the year based on our electric sales volume for the first half. Anticipated declines due to plant closings in some segments were offset by growth in other segments. To-date, our weather normalized retail sales have grown by 0.8% as compared to 2010. Excluding sales to our largest customers the iron ore mine, normalized sales were leveled with 2010 for the first half of the year. These results were in line with our overall forecast.", "I will now discuss our earnings guidance for this year. We are raising our annual earnings guidance from a range of $2.05 to $2.10 a share to a revised range of $2.10 to $2.14 a share from the continuing operations. We\u2019re comfortable rising this range, because of our strong results through the first half of the year, which were driven by cold weather, slightly strong electric sales to our largest customers and effective cost controls. We will also benefit from the extremely hot weather we have experienced in July, but with that said, we still have over five months to avoid the risk. Offsetting these factors will be unfavorable fuel collections as compared to our original plan.", "For the third quarter of 2011, we are forecasting earnings per share from continuing operations in the $0.47 to $0.50 a share range. Last year we earned $0.47 a share in the third quarter, restated for the 2 for 1 stock split earlier this year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we see four large items that are expected to cause variance in quarterly earnings.", "First, last year was very hard and we estimate that weather helped our third quarter earnings by $0.8 a share. Second, with the implementation of new fuel rules, we expect to see a favorable variance of $0.05 in fuel recoveries this quarter. We expect to undercollect fuel cost in the third quarter, but collect more than in 2010. Third, we expect increased O&M expenses associated with strong damage in July and a major maintenance project that went about 18 facilities.", "Finally, the income from unit 2 at Oak Creek should boast third quarter earnings by $0.3 a share. These four factors get us to about $0.48 a share from continuing operation for the third quarter of 2011. We increased the range slightly for the hot July weather.", "With that, I will turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Rick, Thank you very much. Overall, we are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Paul. Good afternoon.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Good afternoon. Congratulations.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you. Is there anything particular you\u2019re congratulating us about, Paul?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Solid quarter, good company, good management.", "Gale Klappa", "Keep on, I like that. Thank you, Paul. What can we do for you?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Just wondering the lower benefits you experienced in the second quarter, was there a timing issues or should that fall through the rest of the year?", "Gale Klappa", "Actually, it\u2019s a very good question. And let me say this. One of the benefits that we saw in terms of lower costs in the first half was related to employee healthcare, our active medical plans and the cost they incurred. Whether that really transcend through the entire year this year. We just don\u2019t know yet. But certainly that was one of the major factors that helped us achieve lower O&M cost during the first half of the year. As you know sometime these medical claims content to be lumpy, but we did have a very good experience on medical claims and medical payments in the first half.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay, thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Brian, how are you doing today?", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Good, thanks. Could you just remind us when the share buyback program went into effect? And it looks like you\u2019ve done $20 million worth of buyback. It was in effect, just wondering if that\u2019s kind of a run rate we should expect?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, obviously we\u2019re looking at this as we go. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily project the continuous run rate. But the share buyback program was authorized by our board. At the board meeting right before annual meeting on May 5, and I believe we actually began repurchasing some shares in July.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Okay. And then, on the tax rate, I think you said 34% to 35% in \u201811, is \u2013 will it revert back to 36% tax rate post 2011? Or is that kind of the new-tax basis?", "Gale Klappa", "We\u2019ll ask our controller Steve Dickson to answer that question for you.", "Steve Dickson", "I think next year it\u2019ll take up a little bit slightly. This year we\u2019re getting the benefit from equity AFUDC, as Rick had mention on the air quality project and \u2013 excuse the, wind mill in the glacier hills. So, once those (inaudible) and the service will stop having AFUDC equity, which has \u2013 as a permanent item. That\u2019s giving us a little benefit this year and we\u2019ll lose a little bit of that next near.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Great, thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Brian. Appreciate your questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Gale Klappa", "There are going to be football, Michael.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "There is going to be football although. I\u2019m more of a college guy, so NFL plays, and NFL players. As long as the SEC is meaning the southeastern conference has been busy is busy, I\u2019m okay.", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah, roll tight, okay.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "You got it. Question for you. When you think about procedurally how kind of what happens from here at the PSCW around your request kind of the accounting order for such having a full bloom GRC. And if you wind up having a full bloom GRC, what would the timeline in the implementation of rates look like, I mean you\u2019re kind of already \u2013 several months behind in the process, if you\u2019re about the start up a typical nine or 10 month process.", "Gale Klappa", "Good question, Michael. First of all, we do expect that the commission will vote on our proposal in August. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to see a significant delay from here in getting a decision from the commission on Door A or Door B. Door A being our creative approach to holding base rates flat or us filing a full rate case and moving through that proceeding. One bit of insight into, if we had to go through Door B, which obviously we believe the company would be just fine going through Derby.", "We have already filed \u2013 when we filed on May 26, we already filed all the backup data related to our projected revenue requirements for 2012. And when the staff did its memo relating to various options or various ideas that they had, what they actually published in that memo was a preliminary audit of our 2012 \u2013 what a 2012 rate case might look like. So we are not as far behind procedurally if we had to go through Derby as one might expect because all the data has been on file. We would refresh the data and if the Commission wants us to proceed with a full general rate case, my guess is, we could file the remaining refreshed data within a couple of weeks after that decision.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. So we wouldn\u2019t be starting from August into a nine or 10 months process? We would be in kind of the mid-point of it and you would start getting briefs and final briefs and have hearings and go from there in the back end half of the year?", "Gale Klappa", "That certainly would be our thinking. We would not be in anyway share perform into a nine or 10 months process from there. I just do not see that. And is to say, we are really ahead of the curve from the standpoint of \u2013 really on May 26, we filed all the necessary data to allow the staff to audit the revenue projections and the cost for 2012.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it.", "Gale Klappa", "Rick is making a point, Michael. We did that for base rates. And then under the new fuel rules, all the utilities have to file their separate fuel plan really within a matter over the next few weeks.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. I will follow-up offline in the fuel plan stuff.", "Gale Klappa", "Okay. Terrific. Thank you, Michael.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Gale Klappa", "Hello, Paul. How are you today?", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "All right. Good afternoon. I want to follow-up on Michael\u2019s question on the rate case.", "Gale Klappa", "Do you have Michael\u2019s number?", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "No. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t actually. But I wanted to ask you about, I mean, it sounded like they were giving you \u2013 that they were presenting options and when I \u2013 and maybe I got it wrong, but I was at the impression that this is sort of a take or leave it option that you are providing in terms of this alternative? That in other words, you basically go to a full on rate case as opposed to some of the alternatives that they were proposing. Could you elaborate a little bit on that or where that stands now?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure, I\u2019ll be happy to. The staffs did seem to \u2013 as we went through the staff memo, the staffs certainly did seem to provide some potential alternatives adjustments. I\u2019m not sure as I\u2019ve read through that they have actually recommended anything except that they put on the table several other options. One, I think compelling point, as we\u2019ve read through that staff memo is that, if the answer is zero then getting to zero with staff adjustments versus getting the zero with our proposal, leaves the customer in exactly the same spot in 2012.", "The customers now better off. But if the staff makes adjustments, then the company would be weaker. So our view as I mentioned in the script is really our only two viable, workable options here. One is, the creative approach with the order that we described or we will certainly proceed with the full case and that\u2019s because the real issue here is how to make room for and how to begin recovering almost $1.3 billion of new investments in projects the commission is already approved and projects are on time and on budget.", "So the issue we are trying to deal with here is, we clearly have under Wisconsin regulation, we clearly have $1.3 billion but has to begin being recovered in rates next year and we thought we could find a way through the accounting order and the seizing of the amortization of some of the commission I\u2019ll use, they\u2019ve given us. We thought we could manage the company and stay flat with base rates next year but if that\u2019s not the case, in other words if they feel like that\u2019s just not the way to go. Then you\u2019re correct, the only viable alternative is to proceed with the full case.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And then switching to the MISO market and the capacity proposal that they came up with now I know that you are mostly regulated and I would think that they probably want to be that much opportunity from a profit and loss perspective perhaps doing capacity sales or what have you into another market. But I was just wondering if there was any impact on rates or any comment that you have with respect to the MISO capacity market filing, what they made it for it?", "Gale Klappa", "Well certainly let Alan give you his view of just to frame it. Again all of the new capacity we have built\u2013 you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s dedicated to retail customers. So I wouldn\u2019t see from the MISO capacity proposal really any significant impact on any of the power of the future units. We do make opportunity sales, but I don\u2019t see any major impact, Alan, do you?", "Allen Leverett", "No I think from a practical standpoint. Given the capacity situation in the MISO foot print as a whole, meaning a reserved margin as a whole as MISO act. I don\u2019t see any impact really of any significant degree on us for a quite a long time.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay.", "Allen Leverett", "And once I impact any sort of additional credits coming back to retail customers.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Great I appreciate it.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcomed. Thanks for your question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of (inaudible) with TDP Capitals.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Well (inaudible) how are you today?", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019m doing well. Good afternoon.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I got to ask now \u2013 are you being paid in Canadian dollars on in U. S. dollars because I\u2019m worried about the exchange rates.", "Unidentified Analyst", "U. S. unfortunately. So we will see.", "Gale Klappa", "Well, try to renegotiate this.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Well, I\u2019m domestic. So, I won\u2019t have a currency translation issue.", "Gale Klappa", "Okay. How are you doing?", "Unidentified Analyst", "I\u2019m doing well. My question is \u2013 as I recall vaguely, and you can remind me whether, what I\u2019m thinking of \u2013 I thought there was like I think, either the \u2013 Wisconsin or a municipal entity had sold, like a power plant or something like that within the state of Wisconsin. And I\u2019m wondering as you have opportunities to deploy capital, besides from, renewables and maybe additional ATC opportunity et cetera. Are there \u2013 do you could see the opportunity for assets within state of Wisconsin that are currently owned by cooperative sort of municipal\u2019s that may be going through financial to us right now given the economy and everything like that or simply priorities that may become available to you that \u2013 we are to be that could be possible?", "Gale Klappa", "Very good question but you will \u2013 and you have seen some something, I\u2019m sure referring to and some of the new stories about the state budget issues. The state does own, the state of Wisconsin itself, does own 29 different steam or power generation facilities, many of them co-gen facilities, scattered throughout the state of Wisconsin. These facilities have traditionally been owned by the state operated by state employees and generally provide energy services or steam services to state buildings ranging from the University of Wisconsin campus in Madison to the state actually.", "Walker administration has taken a position that they believe given the major amounts of capital that will probably have to be spend to upgrade a number of these plants with modern environmental control, that they might consider a sale, of those state own power plants, that would take a piece of legislation. We believe the legislation might be introduced this fall, to enable the Department of Administration, to basically conduct a sale of some or all of those plants. So that is probably what you are hearing. We would have some interest in some of those facilities and it certainly could be if the legislation pass, the potential investment opportunity for us right here inside the state of Wisconsin.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And, does that appear that \u2013 that\u2019s probable?", "Gale Klappa", "Again I think the Walker Administration is going to assess whether or not they will not introduce the legislation this fall. We have some recall elections that are underway in the state right now and I don\u2019t think anything will be decided in terms of a particular piece of legislation on this or any other subject now until after the recall elections. Recall election should be completed by mid-August and then I would think we would have a much clear view of the landscape.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That was it. Thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, (inaudible).", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Levi with Caris & Company.", "Just, I had missed, reason you took up guidance was why?", "Gale Klappa", "The reason, I don\u2019t know why that made me laugh. Andy, because we wanted to make your day. How\u2019s that.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "That\u2019s fine. I didn\u2019t hear, I apologize.", "Gale Klappa", "No, no problem. We had a solid first half. Much of it driven by a colder winter. We have effective cost controls and as we look at where we stand erect, we decided it was the right thing to do to raise the guidance.", "Steve Dickson", "Yep. Maybe a little bit improvement in electric sales in the second quarter to (inaudible).", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay. And just to understand there\u2019s Door A, Door B on this proposal, but there\u2019s no Door C, that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re saying.", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct. And we\u2019re not trying to difficult about it. It\u2019s just that, we have real situations with 1.3 billion of capital, coming into service on project that commission has approved. And that has to be dealt with. So that\u2019s why there\u2019s only a Door A, or Door B.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "And when we get comments tomorrow, I guess, then the next open meeting or open is what August 3rd or something like that? And then August 10th, after that is that kind of where we should think there might be some type of oath by the commissioners?", "Gale Klappa", "I believe, although I don\u2019t think there are seven concrete I believe it\u2019s August 3, and August 11.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "11, okay, thank you. And just to understand the $100 million that was the revenue deficiency? That was based on what 10, 5 ROE?", "Gale Klappa", "No, that was based on our current allowed ROE.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "Which is the \u2013 what is that \u2013 it had them?", "Gale Klappa", "10 forward.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "10 forward.", "Gale Klappa", "And Andy, you\u2019ll see some tomorrow. All of the parties in our proceeding year are supposed to have their comments in tomorrow.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "All right.", "Gale Klappa", "Well, actually see in our comments a chart, that lays out how \u2013 that lays out how we get to that roughly $100 million based on staff adjustments revenue deficiency for 2012.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "That will be very clear for you tomorrow, and for everyone to see.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay. So you guys will be filing something tomorrow as well.", "Gale Klappa", "Absolutely, we upgrade.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much guys. And doing a great job as Mr. Richard said.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Conference.", "Gale Klappa", "Dan?", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Hi.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I have ask this but how was I make it bike riding?", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t see it. I wasn\u2019t a participant, but I didn\u2019t see it unfortunately.", "Gale Klappa", "Let me get this straight about medicine law. Someone said it\u2019s only illegal to do that if you get complained about.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "I think that\u2019s subject to interpretation.", "Gale Klappa", "Well. I\u2019m glad you knew relative (inaudible)", "Steve Dickson", "What can we do for you, Dan?", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "First a little bit on the Wisconsin rate filing, are there any interveners involved in that case beyond the staff and the company that have taken positions yet or expected to take positions?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes, Dan, there are two traditional participants in the case other than the staff and the company and that\u2019s CUB, the Citizens Utility Board and WIEG, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group. Their initial comments were we don\u2019t have a philosophical opposition to door A or door B, but they\u2019d like to see some numbers from the staff. So now that the staff has done its memo, we would expect that CUB and WIEG would make some comments. They certainly have been invited to by the deadline by the end of the day tomorrow.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Okay. So that will pretty much all clarified by tomorrow.", "Gale Klappa", "That would be our thought.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Okay. And then related to the Michigan rate request, I missed them, what was the amount of that again?", "Gale Klappa", "The request is $17.5 million, of which under Michigan law, we would plan to self-implement a portion of that about $7.7 million in January. And then we would expect a \u2013 under Michigan procedures and law, we would expect a decision from the Michigan Commission on the full case by July of next \u2013 sometimes July of next year.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Okay. And what was the ROE that you requested in that case?", "Gale Klappa", "I believe it\u2019s exactly same ROE, 10.4.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "10.4. Okay. And then I was curious on your electric forecast, the fact that you did raise guidance a little bit. I was wondering what your second half assumptions are related to retail sales growth and in terms of megawatt hours both topline and for the large CNI group?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, Dan, essentially we are leaving our forecast unchanged. We make an annual forecast \u2013 really when you weather normalize our first half, we are dead on the forecast. Some segments are better, some segments are worse, but when you net it all through and weather normalize, our first half 2011 sales actually have been literally dead on the forecast. So we didn\u2019t see a need to actually change the forecast, because that forecast, as you know, is done on a weather normal basis, but obviously we have seen very strong demand in July and that couple with the cold winter and solid earnings for the first half really lead us to a decision to raise the guidance.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Now do you anticipate the 1.8 that you saw from the large CNI in the second quarter being kind of the run rate going forward or do you have an opinion on what to expect in that class.", "Gale Klappa", "We would hope so, but again at this stage of the game, we don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of merit in doing minor adjustments to the annual sales forecast. But again, there would be upside if we saw the stronger economic recovery in the industrial sectors in the second half.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Okay. And then the last thing I was wondering about relates to cash from operations, it\u2019s quite a bit stronger in the first half versus last year and I know you had the tax settlements so forth in one of the big gain for us in the deferred income tax, investment tax credits. And then also on working capital, and so as well how we should think about those categories on the cash flow in the second half.", "Gale Klappa", "Ric or Steve, you want to try to answer Dan\u2019s question about, particularly about working capital.", "Steve Dickson", "I think the question was cash from operations and it was strong, and I would see it continuing strong. Net income, we project it to be up over the prior year, depreciation, non-cash charges, those should increase over prior year\u2019s, so those are good uses of cash.", "Our deferred income tax as I talked about it earlier is bonus depreciation as it carry through the end of the year, and our working capital, one of the guidance in there was we are able to reduce some of our inventory, so that was strong for the first six months.", "I think our working capital is one of the drivers there as our gap in storage and if you can tell us the gas price will be at the end of the year, we will have a better idea but we feel good about the first six months we are seeing it continuing through the year.", "Gale Klappa", "And just to refresh your memory, Dan, we said we\u2019ve about 100 million impact from bonus depreciation issue and $200 million next year as cash stand point", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Okay. So I guess\u2013 how does that translate given you have about 600 million of CapEx in the second half into financings each in the second half.", "Gale Klappa", "We, we have to look also at maturities when you look at our financing needs. I would expect because it\u2019s in our financial plans, that we would, we would have a bond offering at Wisconsin electric level sometime in the second half of this year.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You are more than welcome. Careful on the bike.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "Bye.", "Dan Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Conference", "Bye.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tim Winter with Gabelli & Company", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Tim, how are you?", "Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "There I go \u2013 how are you? I\u2019ve got a couple, couple of questions. One is if you go down and have fully fall rate case. What \u2013 is it like and then extends into next year is it? Would it be likely that the rain increase would be retroactive to January 1st?", "Gale Klappa", "No. Under Wisconsin law, there really is no retroactive rate making if you will. So \u2013 but there will be two pieces, obviously, there would be the separate fuel plan, fuel cost plan and under the new fuel rules that went into effect the commission would \u2013 we would file and we were not to do, nor was any other utility in Wisconsin due to file the fuel cost plan until next month.", "So we would be on time in terms of the normal schedule for a fuel adjustment, at the end of December starting in January.", "So that piece would not be affected by a schedule for a general rate case. So the only piece that would be, would be base rates. And there we would certainly try to work with the commission and the staff to try to get a timely decision.", "As you may have heard me answer one of the other callers, we\u2019re really not all that far behind the curve because of all the data that was filed on May 26, that has already allowed the commission staff to do a preliminary audit of 2012 adjustments and expenses in revenue needs.", "Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Great. Then second question, can you update us on the \u201812 and \u201813 CapEx budget? And then maybe give some idea what types of rate base growth that you may have post 13?", "Gale Klappa", "Absolutely, we would be happy, Rick and I will do that together. And we\u2019re turning to a page right now where we have our \u201812 and \u201813 broken down.", "Steve Dickson", "This is on our website too.", "Gale Klappa", "We have about \u2013 just to start off. We have about a run rate on depreciation. We have about $250 million a year, $250 to $260. For actually it would be going up to \u2013 2012 would be $310 and 2013 would be $320, that\u2019s our estimate of depreciation in each of those two years. And then as you know \u2013 we have a significant amount of capital spend that we need to do on what I call network renewal.", "And a lot of that is simply replacement of aging powerful transformers, substations, conductors etcetera. So we have a run rate of about $400 million a year in \u201812 and \u201813 for network renewal and then we also have additional spending on environmental and renewable, Rick?", "Frederick Kuester", "Yeah. And then if you look at our rate base, we are showing our rate bases $6.7 billion in $2012 and essentially flat to 2013 because of the effects of the bonus depreciation. So basically a flat rate base from \u201812 to \u201813 exactly right, if you would have looked at this slide, that\u2019s on our website, six months ago or some months ago we would have been projecting about a $7 billion rate base in 2013. With the bonus depreciation, which gives us cash now, basically it took the rate base growth down back, took the rate base growth down and that\u2019s why we are showing the 67 and 67 in terms of projected rate base for 12, 13. Is that respond to your question.", "Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Yeah. So I was just wondering, what sorts of longer-term projects post our team, that you\u2019re considering?", "Gale Klappa", "We have a very significant list of projects that we are systematically working our way through. We talked about a couple of them earlier, one is the possibility that the state may divest some of its energy assets. And that would certainly give us an investment opportunity. We know, as I mentioned in the script that we\u2019re going to under the current law need additional renewables beyond 2016. We still have to deal with aging gas and electric distribution infrastructure.", "And I\u2019m very confident that we\u2019re going to be seeing additional capital spending probably in that \u201813 and \u201814 timeframe and we have budgeted related to \u2013 additional regulations related to gas distribution and pipeline safety. Of those regulations and those proposals are being debated right now by FERC and the Congress.", "But remember we have a pretty sizable natural gas distribution business. And I\u2019m quite confident we\u2019re going to see to meet additional requirements of the gas network in particular additional capital spend. And then as you know, EPA is continuing to form related additional air quality control rules and air quality control, it\u2019s the water intake rules as well of many of the power plants. The plants that don\u2019t have cooling towers today.", "So there is a whole range of potential investment opportunities and we are systematic working our way through those to see what our 2014, 2015, 2013 capital spend looks like. Rick anything you would like to add?", "Frederick Kuester", "Thank you very much. Gale.", "Tim Winter \u2013 Gabelli & Company", "Great. Thank you guys.", "Frederick Kuester", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Caris & Company.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Andy. You\u2019re back.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "Yeah. And just a quick follow-up, the 210 to 214 can we carry out through to 2012.", "Gale Klappa", "Andy, right now, because of where we stand in terms of trying to work through the 2012 revenues with the commission, I think, we really can\u2019t give you 2012 guidance right now. But we certainly wanted to give our best look at the remainder of 2011. Inspired", "Andy Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "I understand the guidance, but in the sense the things that get you to the 210, 214 or sustainable in 2012.", "Gale Klappa", "Well, part of what get us to the cold winter and hot July. So I would leave that to your discretion but I would say that at the present time we need to keep our power cool here for 2012 dry exactly.", "But the other hand is that why we do have some APDC in there for Glacier Hills went apart and the air controls that swap or create like that is kind of centerpiece of next year right case whether be door A or door B and we would expect to cover on those projects such are going into service.", "Andy Levi \u2013 Caris & Company", "Okay, thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Andy.", "Operator", "All right. With that, ladies and gentlemen, I believe concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating.

Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy\u2019s Conference Call to review 2011 year-end results. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language.

Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.

A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale Klappa", "Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Happy Groundhog Day. I can tell you that the tundra is not frozen. But we appreciate you joining us for our review today of the company\u2019s 2011 yearend results.", "Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team, who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and CEO of We Generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Pat Keyes, is serving as our Treasurer; Steve Dickson, Controller; and of course, Jim Fleming, our General Counsel.", "On a personal note, this is the last time that Jim will be officially sitting in on our conference calls. After a long and productive career, Jim has decided to retire. He\u2019s done a truly outstanding job as our General Counsel over the past six years and we\u2019ll miss him but we understand that his lake house and his classic Corvette are calling. Jim, our entire team wishes you and Kay in Godspeed as you open a new chapter of your life.", "James Fleming", "Thank you, Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome. Thank you, Jim. Now, Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news released this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $2.18 a share for the 2011. This compares with earnings of $1.92 a share for 2010. A number of factors contributed to our strong performance in 2011 including earnings from our Power the Future assets. As you recall, our second expansion unit at Oak Creek began commercial service in January of 2011.", "We also recorded equity AFUDC related to the Air Quality Control upgrade at our older Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our financial and operational performance in 2011. We exceeded our customer satisfaction goals. We achieved the best safety record in the history of the company and we were named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the seventh time in the past 10 years.", "Turning now to the economy of Wisconsin\u2019s area, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate at 7.1% remains well below the national average. And after nearly a double-digit rebound in 2010, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by three-tenths of a percent in 2011. The demand destruction that we saw from five large plant closings during recession is now being largely offset by modest growth and recovery in other sectors of the region\u2019s economy. For example, we continue to see strength in specialty steel and metal fabrication, paper and printing and industrial machine rate.", "Now I\u2019d like to update you on three of our significant construction projects, the 50-megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin, the Glacier Hills Wind project, northeast of Madison and the air quality control upgrade of the original Oak Creek units. We\u2019re making and I\u2019m pleased to say excellent progress on the biomass plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. The foundations for the boiler and fuel storage buildings are now complete, and we\u2019re well underway on steel erection for the boiler and the fuel storage facility. As I\u2019ve noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our renewable energy portfolio. We\u2019ll be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will be used to produce steam for the paper mill will clearly enhance the economics of the project.", "Our investment in the biomass plan is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC. We\u2019re on schedule and on budget to meet the completion date by the end of 2013. I\u2019m also pleased to report that on December 20, 2011, the Glacier Hills Wind Park was placed in the commercial service. Glacier Hills is 162-megawatt energy center located on more than 15,000 acres of rolling farm land about 45 miles Northeast of Madison. It is the largest wind farm in Wisconsin.", "The completion of Glacier Hills is on time and actually better than budget. It was achieved largely through the talents of Wisconsin labor and Wisconsin companies. When all the costs are finalized, we expect the project to come in below the target of $363.7 million that was set by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. The $363 million target does not include allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs. Of course, the biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin\u2019s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015.", "To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity produced by renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a state-wide level. The standard then sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using a historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.27% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewables in 2015.", "When we complete the biomass project, we will be well-positioned to meet that 2015 standard. I should point out, however, that we expect to deplete our bank of renewal credits, and as a result, we project a need for additional credits or renewable generation by the year 2017.", "Finally, we\u2019re nearing completion of the air quality control upgrade for the original coal-fired units at Oak Creek. These four units are among the most efficient base load units anywhere in the Midwest. So the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities. Overall, the project spans today at about 94% complete.", "The tie-in work for Unit 5 has been sufficient and tuning and testing of the equipment is well underway. The tie-in outage for Unit 6 began in early January, and the tie-in work for Unit 7 and Unit 8 are on schedule for the spring. We expect the newer quality controls to be fully operational this year and we remain on budget, again at a cost of approximately $900 million. This is the second largest construction project in our history.", "Now, I would like to briefly review where we stand on the regulatory on Wisconsin and Michigan. We\u2019re pleased that there will be no increase in rates for electric customers in Wisconsin in 2012 as a result of the actions taken by the Wisconsin Commission. As we reported to you on our last call, the Commission in October approved our creative approach to keep base rates flat for customers as the economy here continues to recover. To recap the rate plan approved by the Commission authorizes us to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory assets in 2012. Then the plan authorizes us to recover $148 million of carrying costs and depreciations for the air quality controls at Oak Creek, and the Glacier Hills Wind Park.", "And on January 5 of this year, the Commission issued an order for our 2012 fuel plan approving an increase of the fuel costs recovery rate for the year. However, that increase will be offset by a credit \u2013 a credit of $26 million representing proceeds that we received from the settlement of spent fuel litigation with the Department of Energy.", "As a result of these two decisions there will be no base rate increase or nor fuel increase for our retail electric customers in Wisconsin in 2012. It\u2019s also important to note that we have the authority to file a full rate case in 2012 for new rates to be effective in January of 2013. We\u2019re finalizing the details of the case now and we expect to file with the Commission in late March.", "Turning now to our Michigan operations, you\u2019ll recall that in July of last year we filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for an annual rate increase of $17.5 million. We\u2019re seeking to recover from Michigan customers their pro rata share of renewable generation, environmental controls and cost associated with the second expansion unit at Oak Creek.", "In late December, the Commission directed the company to self implement a $5.7 million increase that took effect on January 5. The Commission\u2019s directive also authorized the company to implement a $2.7 million credit, again, of the proceeds we received from our settlement with the Department of Energy.", "Applying the credit, the net effect of the interim rate increase for customers in Michigan is $3 million or 1.7%. We expect the Michigan Commission to rule on our entire request by July 5 of this year. In addition, approximately $2 million of renewable costs were included on our Michigan fuel recovery rate that took effect on January 1 of this year. So the total self implementation comes to $7.7 million.", "And another important matter, the Environmental Protection Agency, as you\u2019re aware, issued on August 8, its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule commonly known as CSAPR. Subsequently, a number of parties, including Wisconsin Electric, petitioned the federal court and the EPA to delay the rule to ensure that it would be implemented in a fair and reasonable manner.", "In late December, the Court of Appeals in Washington DC staved the CSAPR rules that were scheduled to take effect on January 1. The court noted that petitioners had raised significant questions about potential flaws in the new rules that govern emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The court indicated that the EPA should continue to administer the Clean Air Interstate Rule, better known as CAIR, pending the resolution of these issues that have been raised. Of course, in light of major investments we\u2019ve made over the past decade in efficient new generation and air quality controls on our older base load units, we believe we\u2019ve very well-positioned to comply with CAIR and with any revised CSAPR rules. We\u2019ll keep you posted as developments occur in the case.", "On a related note, in early January, we announced that we\u2019re exploring a potential joint venture opportunity in our Presque Isle power plant in Marquette County, Michigan.", "Our partner in this potential joint venture is Wolverine Power Cooperative, a large Michigan-based co-op. Now, given our current base load capacity position, we do not believe that it would be economic for our customers to fund the capital that would be necessary to meet likely new environmental regulations, regulations that would impact the coal-fired units at Presque Isle.", "However, Wolverine needs base load capacity. And so, we\u2019re jointly exploring the possibility of Wolverine investing in major new air quality controls at Presque Isle in exchange for an undivided interest in the plant. It had to be clear, if this joint venture moves forward, our ownership of the plant would be reduced, but we would not expect a reduction in rate base.", "We believe our customers would see lower operating costs from the plant because Wolverine\u2019s customers would pick up their pro rata share of the cost of running the units. Based on our analysis today, the joint venture would be beneficial to our customers and Wolverine\u2019s customers, but significant work including a full engineering analysis must be performed before we can proceed.", "I would add that the proposed joint venture would not materially affect our capital spending budget for the years 2012 through 2016 because we were not planning to add significant air quality controls at Presque Isle. I also would like to emphasize the regardless of the decision about the future of Presque Isle, the electric transmission network that supports the Upper Peninsula of Michigan must be improved, both to maintain reliability and allow for economic growth.", "Turning now to other material developments. As we reported in our third quarter 10-Q, the company has been working through a legal issue regarding our cash balance pension plan. In November, we entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs , and the court promptly issued a preliminary order approving the settlement.", "Our fourth quarter results include a charge of less than $0.04 a share to reflect our final cost for the settlement. We do not expect to incur any additional charges other than minor process-related costs as the settlement is implemented. Finally, I\u2019d like to update you on a recent development concerning accelerated depreciation of the investment and our power to future assets.", "In late December, the internal revenue service confirmed that accelerated depreciations can be applied to our recently completed expansion units at the Oak Creek site. Now as a result of this ruling, we expect to see a $285 million cash timing benefit by the end of 2014. In the financial forecast that we provided you and may public in November, we have assumed a $250 million benefit. Now this timing item will not impact the deferred tax balance at our utilities, so this latest development will not affect the rate base of our utilities.", "The cash though from accelerated depreciation will help fund the higher level of investment we\u2019re projecting in our five-year capital spending plan. As you know, we\u2019ve identified several important projects, projects that are necessary to upgrade the ageing gas and electric distribution infrastructure across the region. Secondly, we plan to continue reducing our debt levels of the holding company in order to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings and keep our borrowing costs low.", "And as you may have seen from our news release a couple of weeks ago, our board has now adopted a revised dividend policy. It calls for us to reach a 60% payout ratio in 2014. That\u2019s one year earlier than previously expected. This new policy should support double digit growth in the dividend in both 2013 and 2014 as we work to achieve a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the electric utility industry. Of course, our board of directors took a major step forward last month by approving for 2012 a dividend increase of 15%, bringing our annual dividend rate to $1.20 a share.", "I\u2019d also like to address the status of our share repurchase plan. Essentially, there is no change in our share buyback program. As we previously discussed, the board has authorized a share repurchase plan schedule to run through the end of 2013 that calls for us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy Common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.", "Through today, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an average purchase price of $30.79 a share. So, in summary, we entered 2012 in excellent condition financially and operationally. The company continues to perform at a high level, and our power to future investments are providing tangible benefits for our customers and our stockholders.", "And now with more details on our full year financial performance for 2011 and our outlook for the year ahead, here\u2019s our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Kuester. Rick?", "Frederick Kuester", "Okay. Thanks, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, in our 2011 full year earnings \u2013 in 2011, our full year earnings from continued operations were $2.18 a share. I will focus on operating income by segment for the year and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss full year cash flows and cover our earning guidance for 2012.", "Our consolidated operating income for 2011 was $887 million as compared to $810 million for 2010, an increase of $77 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $545 million, which is down $19 million from 2010.", "Looking at our Utility segment, our electric margins were helped by approximately $14 million because of pricing increases at the wholesale level and also in our Michigan jurisdiction, primarily to recover costs associated with our Power the Future plans. In addition, we saw growth in our electric sales, which added approximately $10 million of operating income. When we look at weather, we estimate that our operating income was reduced by $13 million as compared to the prior year. During 2011, we experienced normal winter weather, which helped our gas business as compared to 2010.", "On the electric side, we experienced a hotter than normal summer but 2010 was even warmer. So we actually saw a reduction in our earning due to weather compared to 2010. We also saw increased non-fuel operating and maintenance cost totaling $26 million as we released dollars in our generation business for a terminal overhaul in our distribution business for forestry work and higher Power the Future costs related to our wholesale and Michigan customers. These factors combined with $4 million of other net items resulted in the $19 million decline in utility operating income.", "Our operating income in the Non-Utility Energy segment, which includes We Power, came in as expected and was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily because of earnings associated with the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. Unit 2 achieved commercial operation in January of 2011, so there were no earnings associated with that unit in the prior year. We also had a full year of earnings from the first unit as compared to 11 months of earnings in 2010. The result was a favorable impact of approximately $97 million on our 2011 operating income. Taking the changes for these two segments, together along with corporate charges and other miscellaneous items. It brings you to this $77 million increase in operating income for the full year.", "During 2011, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled nearly $63 million or $3 million increase over 2010. Other income increased by $23 million, primarily because of higher AFUDC on our Utility Construction projects, including the Air Quality Control System for the older Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. AFUDC, of course, allows us to accrue a return on these approved utility projects during construction.", "Our net interest expense increased by $30 million because of two main factors: first, when the second unit Oak Creek achieved commercial operation, We Power issued $420 million of long-term debt to replace short-term debt that was used to finance the construction of Unit 2; second, once Unit 2 achieved commercial operation, we no longer capitalized on interest on the construction work in progress. Our capitalized interest was almost $26 million lower in 2011 as compared to 2010. While we saw higher interest expense at the We Power level, our holding company interest expense declined as we retired $450 million of 6.5% long-term debt on April 1, 2011.", "In addition, we were able to take advantage of the low interest rate environment in September of 2011 when our Wisconsin Electric subsidiary issued 10-year bonds with a coupon rate below 3%. Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $14 million because of higher pre-tax earnings offset by slightly lower effective tax rate. The lower effective income tax rate was primarily driven by higher levels of equity AFUDC.", "For 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37% which is consistent with the expectation of lower equity AFUDC. Our effective tax rate in 2011 was 34%. Combining all of these items brings you to $513 million of net income from continuing operations for full year 2011 or earnings of $2.18 per share.", "During 2011, we generated $993 million of cash from operations which is up $183 million from the same period in 2010. Our strong cash flows were driven by higher net income and higher deferred income tax expense primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation rules. We estimated that deferred income taxes had a positive cash impact of $430 million and we\u2019ve created a deferred tax asset which we expect will reduce future cash taxes by $328 million. Our 2011 operating cash flows were reduced by $277 million because of contributions to our qualified benefit claims. No such contributions were made in 2010 and we do not plan to make contributions in 2012.", "Our total capital expenditures were approximately $831 million in 2011; about $792 million of this was dedicated to our utility businesses which included the Glacier Hills Wind Project and the air quality control project at the old Oak Creek units. We also paid $242 million in common dividends in 2011 which was an approximate 30% increase over 2010.", "Consistent with our dividend announcement in January 2012, we expect to pay approximately $279 million of dividends in 2012. Also, as Gale mentioned, in January, our board approved the plan that calls for us to reach a 60% dividend payout ratio beginning in 2014.", "On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-cap was 57.1% as of December 31 and we were at 54.4% on an adjusted basis. These ratios are slightly higher than our December 2010 levels of 56.9% and 54.1% respectively but were better than planned. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We expect the 2012 ratios to be in line with the 2011 ratios.", "Consistent with our past practice, we are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. As we discussed in the past, our board of directors authorized the share repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock through 2013. As Gale noted through today, we have repurchased approximately $100 million of our common shares and an average price of $30.79 a share.", "As shown in our earnings package on our website, our actual 2011 retail sales of electricity decreased 0.5% as compared to hot 2010. On a weather-normalized basis, 2011 retail sales excluding the mine increased 0.4%. This is better than the 0.6% weather-normalized decline we had forecast for 2011. Overall for 2012, we are projecting to see a slight decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized electricity sales including the \u2013 excluding the mines versus normalized 2011 sales. This includes the loss of sales due to two customers installing their own sales generation. Adjusting for this, we project that sales, excluding the mines, will grow by 0.4%.", "We also project flat residential sales with low housing starts and continued conservation efforts. We expect to see continued moderate growth in the small commercial and industrial class. And we are forecasting the large commercial and industrial class, excluding the mines, to decline by 2.4% due to the installation of self generation. Excluding those customers and the mines, the large commercial and industrial class is expected to grow by 0.5%.", "I will now discuss our earnings guidance for 2012. We estimate our 2012 earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.24 to $2.29 per share. As we look at our businesses, we expect to see growth from our utilities, slight growth at We Power, and lower costs at the corporate level due to reduced interest expense and our share buyback program.", "As we look at our utility business, you will remember that the Wisconsin Commission approved our proposal to avoid price increases in 2012 by ceasing the amortization of a $148 million of costs associated with regulatory assets. So we expect to see a reduction in our OEM cost with the one year amortization holiday.", "Also, we expect increased depreciation expense and a lower AFUDC when the air quality control project that the older Oak Creek units is placed into service. Due to the rate case decision and the timing of fuel recoveries, we expect that first quarter earnings in 2012 will be in the range of $0.75 to $0.78 per share. This includes the effect of warmer than normal weather in January. Finally, I\u2019d like to reiterate that we are targeting a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6%.", "With that I\u2019ll turn things back over to, Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Rick, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "And now we\u2019d like to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Greg, how are you today?", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "Hi, good morning, Gale, it\u2019s actually Bill, how are you guys doing?", "Gale Klappa", "Oh, Bill, hi. We\u2019re good, how about you? What you do with Greg?", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "I think he stepped off for a second. Actually \u2013 so we had a question about your comments on the dividend.", "Gale Klappa", "Sure.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "And, so I guess, you said you\u2019re pulling for your targeted payout ratio for 60% by 2014 now?", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah, that\u2019s correct.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "Right, and so, and you\u2019re saying that that would imply \u2013", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "Hey, Gale, I\u2019m back.", "Gale Klappa", "There you go.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "Yes, so the question is you\u2019ve said that you were targeting a 60% payout ratio by 2014 and that that implied double-digit growth \u2013 percentage growth in the dividend between now and then. Is that an accurate regurgitation of your comment?", "Gale Klappa", "You done regurgitate well.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay, so we can infer from that, that there\u2019s sort of a minimum level of expected earnings growth over the course of the next two years. If we just do the algebra and what that means in terms of your earnings power?", "Gale Klappa", "We thought, you might like to do your own math, but you are correct.", "Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group", "Okay. Thank you, Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, and Bill, thank you.", "Operator", "Jim Von Riesman with UBS. Please state your question.", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "Hi, Gale, good afternoon.", "Gale Klappa", "Good afternoon, Jim, how are you doing today?", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "I\u2019m doing well. Thanks. Couple of question if you don\u2019t mind, the first one is can you just talk about what\u2019s happening in the state politically with this governor Walker recall efforts and if there\u2019s any update in status on the generation buy from the state?", "Gale Klappa", "Sure, I\u2019ll be happy too Jim. By the way were you out there with Ponsitony Phil this morning?", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "No.", "Gale Klappa", "Well the state political situation. It does certainly appear that we are headed for a recall election. Right now the Government Accountability Board of the state is parsing through approximately 1 million signatures to determine how many of those signatures are valid signatures petitioning a recall. That is going to take some time. And in fact the Government Accountability Board has asked for more time and the court has provided them more time.", "So the best guess estimate now is that we would have a recall election sometime between April and June of this year. In the meantime as you can about imagine the airwaves are full of political commercials on both sides. We don\u2019t expect any significant legislation and certainly nothing affecting energy policy to be dealt with or debated over the course of the next few months. And if indeed there is going to be a piece of legislation that would authorize the sale of some of the state-owned power plants that would not occur certainly until the fall.", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "Okay. Just a quick order or reference here what\u2019s the threshold for either he stays or he goes in terms of the vote count? Simple majority?", "Gale Klappa", "Oh no. It\u2019s simple, but yeah, 50% plus one vote.", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "Okay. Second question is I guess this is more for Rick. If I heard you correctly you said $3.2 million share buyback roughly at $31 a share or just under that. Is that right?", "Frederick Kuester", "$30.79.", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "Okay. So that\u2019s a $100 million. But the cash flow statement that you released today says you had a decreased in repurchased stock of about $140 million. What\u2019s that $40 million delta?", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019ll let Steve Dickson, our controller, go through that, Jim.", "Stephen Dickson", "Yeah. Thanks, Jim. That item is consistent with item that we\u2019ve had in past years. When stock options are exercised, we take the proceeds of the stock options and then go to the open market and buy back stock. So the delta between $100 million and $140 million is cash that we used to buy back our own shares to satisfy stock options and other stock awards.", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "Okay, just double checking. And then last question is in pension. Well, are you prepared to talk about your revised discount rate assumptions or your plan asset recurrence at this point in time?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, we\u2019ve certainly made then public. Let me state first that we made, as Rick mentioned, the $277 million contribution to our benefit plans during 2011. And when you look at our funding position against our liabilities, we are very, very well-positioned. We\u2019re also quite conservative in terms of our \u2013 at least in terms of our industry, in terms of future asset growth.", "Steve, do you want to give a shot?", "Stephen Dickson", "Also, I think we have a conservative asset mix.", "Gale Klappa", "Yes.", "Frederick Kuester", "Overall, we\u2019ve got a very conservative program. Steve, go through the details.", "Stephen Dickson", "Yeah. We worked with our actuaries to get the year-end discount rate and it\u2019s just 5.05, so that\u2019s what we have the liabilities valued at. As Gale said, our expected return on assets remains the same at 7.25% and then the actual returns were about 2.5% in 2011.", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "Okay. I\u2019ll follow-up with you on some other questions after the call.", "Frederick Kuester", "Okay. Jim, thank you for your call. We appreciate it.", "Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Rock and roll, Michael. How are you?", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m okay, Gale. You?", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah. We\u2019re fine. We\u2019re doing well.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Couple of questions. First of all, can you walk us through going forward, so let\u2019s say what\u2019s embedded in your 2012 guidance for cash flow \u2013 for basically deferred tax-related cash flows whether it\u2019s from Oak Creek, whether it\u2019s from PTCs, but those that accrued kind of back to the holding company or the shareholder and don\u2019t necessarily go to a reduction in rate base. I\u2019m probably more thinking about the PTF units than I am about kind of the bonus (inaudible) the utility record (inaudible). But if there\u2019s a way to just quantify how much cash gets upstreamed that is related to deferred taxation?", "Stephen Dickson", "We\u2019re all thinking about how to make that calculation quickly for you.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "We can \u2013 if that\u2019s a pain, we can follow up offline. My other one is CapEx. You\u2019re \u2013 it seems a little unusual that your CapEx going up but it\u2019s not \u2013 meaning from earlier 2011 guidance ranges.", "Stephen Dickson", "That is correct.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "But your load growth is pretty like a lot of part to the Midwest relatively versus history.", "Stephen Dickson", "Correct.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That strikes me as an unusual dichotomy. And could you through some of the drivers of that?", "Stephen Dickson", "Sure. I think it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s a good question but a very straightforward answer. The additional CapEx spending, and let\u2019s kind of reset that, our 2011 through 2015 plan called for about $3.4 billion of capital spending. Our 2012 through 2016 plan is about $100 million increase at $3.5 billion. The difference between the two rolling five-year plans, Michael, is really replacement of aging infrastructure. I mean we have, as I mentioned in the past, we have aging underground lines, we have aging power poles, we have aging (inaudible) transformers. So we have got \u2013 we really need to maintain the reliability that our customers have come to rely on and deserve. We need to spend more capital on replacement of aging electric and gas distribution infrastructure. That\u2019s the big difference.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. And how are you guys thinking about O&M next year relative to \u2013 meaning in 2012, I guess that\u2019s this year, relative to 2011 levels?", "Gale Klappa", "Two answers to that because the second answer is very important to make sure you can follow our financials as we go through the year. First answer is that on an operating basis, we\u2019re projecting our O&M to be basically flat. However, you will see a reduction when we report earnings in the first quarter and subsequent quarters. You\u2019ll actually see a reduction in O&M because of the amortization holiday in the rate case.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And can you quantify that?", "Gale Klappa", "$148 million.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. It\u2019s the full amount. Okay. So we should look, think about $148 million year-over-year reduction in O&M? No. No, actually, that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s right. I got it. I\u2019ll follow up. Colleen and I touched on it this morning.", "Gale Klappa", "All right.", "Operator", "Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates, please proceed with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Good afternoon, Paul. How are you doing?", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Hey, how are you doing?", "Gale Klappa", "Pretty good.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "A couple of questions has been asked and answered, but just wanted to touch basically on the rate base growth and just a question that Michael asked about the weak anemic growth. I mean, how do you guys see customer rates? I know you guys are focused on keeping them as controlled as possible. Going forward, with this CapEx build-out and with this anemic growth kind of a concern that you have to sort of do this CapEx adjustment and there doesn\u2019t seem to be that much growth.", "Gale Klappa", "Paul, one more time. I\u2019m not sure I actually follow \u2013", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. You guys have a considerable amount of CapEx that you\u2019re going to have to \u2013 I mean, in terms of replacing the aging infrastructure.", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "And it sounds like sales growth is in all that robust.", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "And so, I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I know that you guys are very proactive in keeping weights as manageable as possible \u2013", "Gale Klappa", "Right.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", " \u2013 but at just how should we think about the rate trajectory fuel excluded going forward?", "Gale Klappa", "Well it\u2019s a good question and I appreciate the clarification. First of all, for 20 rates that would going to affect in 2013, if you recall we basically have deferred a rate case for a year and I mentioned our customers will see no increase either in fuel costs or in base electric rates during 2012.", "But that deferral for a year means that we have put off a rate increase request that is largely driven by capital we\u2019ve already spent on important projects that either our coming into the service now or already in service.", "We have three major projects that will be the drivers of our 2012 rate request for 2013 and that\u2019s the quality control, the $900 million that we\u2019re spending on the air quality control upgrade of the older Oak Creek units, the Glacier Hills Wind Park and then the ongoing construction costs at the Rothschild Biomass Plant that would come into service in late 2013.", "So, those three factors, those major construction projects all approved by the Commission will be big drivers for our 2012 rate filing for 2013 rates. And that will be obviously a sizeable rate increase with the filing that we\u2019ll make this spring. Beyond that, I would think we would be looking at 3% to 4%, 3% to 5% something in that range. But we would hope 3% or 4% base rate increase is absent fuel going forward once we get this rate increase behind us.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. And just the magnitude of the rate increase that we\u2019re looking at for 2013 potentially or is it too early to say considering that you haven\u2019t \u2013 too early to process to \u2013", "Gale Klappa", "No. We\u2019re finalizing the details of that case now and it would probably be in the neighborhood of 6%to 7%.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay.", "Stephen Dickson", "And we said it\u2019s going to be in the same neighborhood as the -what we\u2019ve thought for last year was in that \u2013", "Gale Klappa", "Right.", "Stephen Dickson", "\u2013 6% to 7%.", "Gale Klappa", "I think last year, our filing was 6.6%.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Right.", "Gale Klappa", "But okay, if we had a traditional case, it would be that amount. But we will put this off for a year.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "I got you. And then also you mentioned self-generation and if you could just maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the customers and if that\u2019s a unique situation or what sort of driving that?", "Gale Klappa", "I don\u2019t see it being a widespread situation at all. One is a \u2013 one of the organizations that is moving a bit towards self-generation is a sewage \u2013 Metropolitan Sewerage District and the other is a paper mill.", "Stephen Dickson", "One using landfill gas which is \u2013", "Gale Klappa", "Right.", "Stephen Dickson", "\u2013 there\u2019s limited availability on that and the other paper mill is just a biomass project. So I think they\u2019re fairly unique as Gale says.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.", "Gale Klappa", "Good questions, Paul. Thank you.", "Operator", "Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc, you may proceed with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Paul. How are you?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Good afternoon.", "Gale Klappa", "How are you doing?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "I\u2019m well, thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Good.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "A question, a follow-up on Jim Von Riesman\u2019s question about the discrepancy on the buyback versus $140 million on the cash flow statement. So you get this $40 million in and then you spend it on buybacks. Where does it show up coming in on the cash flow statement?", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re describing that quite accurately. We are \u2013 remember that we are using cash. Forget about the buybacks for a minute, we have historically hear ever since our management team has been in place. We have used cash to satisfy company obligations related to stock option exercises, 401(k) plans, other stock grants that might be made during the course of the year. So you really have to look at two pieces, the dollar spent on share buyback and then what the amounts were related to those plans. Steve?", "Stephen Dickson", "Yeah. Just to add on to that, we haven\u2019t released the 2011 (k) but if you go back to the 2010 (k) on our cash flow statement, we break out these two items. On our cash post statement for 2010, we received cash proceeds of $91 million from people exercising stock options. So we\u2019ve got the $91 million and that was cash flows coming in. And then we repurchased the stock on the open market and that was $156 million. So last year, we were net out $66 million. Do you understand?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Understood. Thank you very much.", "Stephen Dickson", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "And then on your 2012 guidance, what\u2019s your assumption with regards to over or under recovery of fuel?", "Gale Klappa", "I believe in our 2012 guidance, we\u2019re still assuming some modest under recovery of fuel.", "Stephen Dickson", "Correct.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "And then lastly, relative to guidance at the end of the third quarter, I think weather was probably more mild than you expected then you had this for $0.04 pension settlement \u2013", "Stephen Dickson", "Right.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Yet lose at the top end of gains.", "Stephen Dickson", "Is there a question there?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "A question and a statement.", "Gale Klappa", "Well, I\u2019ll take your congratulations and I appreciate that. Well, one of the things \u2013 I mean obviously we had continued effective cost control across the company. Weather did hurt us in the fourth quarter by about $0.04 of share, but the big drivers for the fourth quarter were really the equity AFUDC that we continue to accrue related to the major projects. The fact that we had full quarter of Oak Creek II where we did not, I mean, Oak Creek II was not in service during fourth quarter of 2010. And then weather was a negative factor.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "But you would have known about it, AFUDC in Oak Creek, correct?", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah, that\u2019s correct. Yes, we knew about the AFUDC in Oak Creek and Glacier Hills. And as we say it, we had very effective cost controls across the company.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities. Great, please state your question.", "Gale Klappa", "How are you doing, Jay?", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Hey, very well, Gale. I was hoping we went through a lot of this but hoping we could drill down a little bit into some of the residential trends you\u2019re seeing and appreciate this weather makes it a little difficult to look through this particularly in the quarter. But if we look at the full year, is there more energy efficiency? Is this just austerity? I guess what I\u2019m trying get at from your internal projections, the economy \u2013 if the economy accelerates, would you anticipate recovery in your Residential segment?", "Gale Klappa", "It\u2019s very hard to tell. We don\u2019t have enough good data in my mind to be able to say concretely what really is driving the residential class. I have a theory that could be wrong, and that is the limitations of weather normalization techniques. And we had a very, very unusually warm summer in 2010. We had another warm but not as warm summer in 2011, both summers above normal. So the numbers we\u2019re reporting to you in essence are weather-normalized data. I still have some concern about the limitations, just of the weather-normalization techniques and the impact that that\u2019s having on our reported data.", "If we have normal summer this year, I know it\u2019s hard as all it gets out. But if we have a normal summer this year, I think we\u2019ll be able to tell much better what\u2019s going on. There is no question and I\u2019ve mentioned this to you before, there\u2019s no question that in shoulder months when it is easy to conserve, we are definitely seeing more conservation. We are not seeing more conservation when it\u2019s 95 degrees on the lake front or when it\u2019s 20 degrees below.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Got you. But so I understand your suggestion is the weather normalization calculation is understating what is otherwise or weather normalized growth?", "Gale Klappa", "That is my theory and we\u2019ll have to wait for more data to prove whether I\u2019m right or wrong. Now for what it\u2019s worth, another reason why I have some confidence in that theory is that we are seeing better than expected growth in small commercial.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Got you. Okay. And then Rick on HoldCo interest, how should we think about the balancing act of retiring common stock and the growing dividend and your desire to reduce HoldCo debt over time?", "Frederick Kuester", "Yeah. It\u2019s obviously it\u2019s one of the key priorities we got in terms of uses of cash, Jay. What we will look at is the economics of retiring HoldCo debt. We\u2019ve got some 20 33s out there that right would not be economic. We will continue to look at that I would say were probably a couple of used app made big movement right now.", "Gale Klappa", "And Jay just \u2013 Rick is absolutely right. Just to add on the that. You know our whole theory and practice here is invest in solid utility projects that are needed for the region, maintain our credit metrics which means we continue de-lever a bit. And then if there\u2019s extra cash, use that cash in the way that best benefits shareholders from an after-tax return standpoint. So that\u2019s kind of our \u2013 I mean that\u2019s our whole approach to the next several years.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Nope. That\u2019s perfect. I appreciate it. And then last question, Gale, I know it\u2019s a little off in the future but you indicated the need for some incremental renewable capacity by the 2017 timeframe and assuming that was a decision in 2015 and you had to make it today. Is that biomass? Is that wind? Is that some other relative? What would it be?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, given today\u2019s market, if the market today were the same when we faced the decision in 2015 or 2016, we would probably buy renewable credits \u2013", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Perfect.", "Gale Klappa", "\u2013 for the short term.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "Absolutely, great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the help.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Jay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann, you may state your question.", "Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann", "Yes, hello. All my questions have been ask and answered. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Thanks, Brian. Well, we have a pregnant pause here.", "Operator", "Andy Dashal (ph) with Morningstar, please proceed with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi, Andy. How are you?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good afternoon. How are you?", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019m well.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Most of my questions have been answered but kind of just one follow-up clarification on your earnings guidance. You incorporate warmer than normal weather in your first quarter 75 to 78 range. Is that incorporated into your full year while you\u2019re using normal annualized growth from February to December then?", "Gale Klappa", "The answer is yes.", "Frederick Kuester", "Yes, yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Andy.", "Operator", "Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin, please proceed with your question.", "Gale Klappa", "Okay, Dan. I got to ask you, they were trying to redact some signatures before the petitions went public on the recall. Were they trying to redact your name off there?", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "No comment.", "Gale Klappa", "Good afternoon, Dan.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "Good afternoon. First of all, I was just wondering if you could clarify again what the 2012 CapEx plan\u2019s going to be.", "Gale Klappa", "Sure. Rick has the breakdown for you actually.", "Frederick Kuester", "Yeah, Dan. This is on our website but on page 12 of the analyst presentation, we break out our CapEx for 2012. About $705 million is what\u2019s in the budget. Of that, about $70 million is tied to environmental and that\u2019s finishing up the air quality controls \u2013 primarily finishing up the air quality controls at the older Oak Creek units. Renewables, $161 million which is tied to the biomass project and maybe a few dollars associated with Glacier Hills. And the rest, which is about $475 million is just base capital spend, pipe, poles, wires.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "Okay. Given the CapEx and the dividend increase and share buybacks and no pension payments and all of those moving parts, what\u2019s the financing plan for 2012?", "Frederick Kuester", "I think we\u2019ve got one offering sometime this year at the utility of $250 million-ish, roughly, Dan.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "And do you have a quarter when that\u2019s likely to be set, quarter?", "Gale Klappa", "We haven\u2019t set a date yet. Yeah.", "Frederick Kuester", "We haven\u2019t set a date yet.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "Okay.", "Gale Klappa", "And no equity issuances, obviously.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "Right. And then I was just curious about that looking at the electric utility revenues, the wholesale, resale, and other revenues were up fairly big on a percentage basis. Just some color on what\u2019s going on there and what to expect going forward?", "Frederick Kuester", "Sure. We\u2019ll let Allen Leverett, who heads our generation business cover that with you, Dan.", "Allen Leverett", "And, Dan, there are really two categories there. There\u2019s wholesale and then there\u2019s sales for resale. On the wholesale side, we had a 50-megawatt contract with a large co-op here in Wisconsin that we began providing service under that contract. I think it began June 1 of last year. And then we also made some additional sales to a co-op up in the UP of Michigan, so those two together, Dan, increased our wholesale sales about $17.5 million. So that\u2019s two contracts together.", "In addition on the sales for resale and it\u2019s probably the easiest way to think about those, Dan, those are spot sales. So those are sales that you would make on the spot market, it\u2019s micro as opposed to the term market. In 2010, we purchased about 0.03 million megawatt hours from the micro market, whereas in 2011 we sold 1.3 million megawatt hours. So we had a swing of 1.6 million megawatt hours. And the reason that we were able to make those sales is largely because we had the Oak Creek expansion, the second unit of Oak Creek expansion that was available in 2011 and of course it was not available in 2010 because it hasn\u2019t been completed yet.", "So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color about these line items.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "So what\u2019s the term of those wholesale contracts with the co-ops?", "Allen Leverett", "The contract to the Wisconsin co-op is a 10-year contract. The contract with the Michigan co-op was a contract we already had in place, but their take under that contract was a bit more. I think the original term on that contract, Dan, I think we\u2019re into the third year of the contract. The original term of that contract I believe was 25 years. So it was a very longer term contract.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Take care, Dan.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "You too.", "Operator", "Andrew Levi with Caris, please state your question.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Hi.", "Gale Klappa", "Did you get the hat, Andy?", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Yes, thank you, Gale. My son loved it. So, thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "You said it was one of the good ones.", "Gale Klappa", "I\u2019m glad to hear that because it was painful buying it.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Well, it is what it is, but we\u2019ll see what happens this weekend.", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "But thank you again.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Do you guys say there was slide package on your website?", "Gale Klappa", "We do. We have a slide package on the website at www.wisconsinenergy.com.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "I can\u2019t find it. Okay, I\u2019ll work on that. And then the only other question I had, weather-wise for the year 2011, how much of that affect your earnings?", "Gale Klappa", "Rick, it certainly hurt earnings overall.", "Frederick Kuester", "Yeah, we were \u2013 in health gas, gas was up slightly but it was offset by electrical sales about $0.03 a share, electrical expense $0.06 per share. Gas was up $0.03 a share.", "Gale Klappa", "So negative $0.03.", "Frederick Kuester", "As compared to 2010.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "On this, I wanted verse normal anything \u2013 any of that?", "Frederick Kuester", "Steve\u2019s got that on normalize, yeah.", "Stephen Dickson", "Yeah, basically, it was close to normal year. The heating degree days for gas were right here, the 20 degree \u2013 20 year average. So gas was basically a push. And it was a hot summer, but it got warm in the fourth quarter. So, on an operating income \u2013 or excuse me, margin basis, there was only $6 million. So weather was basically a push this year.", "Gale Klappa", "Against normal.", "Stephen Dickson", "Against normal.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "And then just looking at the OEM number which was obviously down quite a bit. Is that sustainable going into 2012?", "Frederick Kuester", "Well, we\u2019ll look at it, Steve, because there\u2019s some accounting changes that affect the way you look at those numbers for 2011 and then I\u2019ll be happy to talk about 2012, Steve?", "Stephen Dickson", "Andy, the reduction in OEM on a year-to-year basis and we talked about this in the first and second quarter. It has to do with the elimination of the intercompany revenues and expenses related to the Power the Future leases. And so the impact because unit two, went into service we eliminated more revenue and that was about $98 million year-to-year difference. So, our consolidated OEM is down $98 million because of the elimination entry, I\u2019d like Gale address the other issue.", "Gale Klappa", "And that this is the last quarter we\u2019re going to see \u2013", "Frederick Kuester", "Right.", "Gale Klappa", "This whole had to do with the Power the Future assets coming into service. Now for 2012 and I may have mentioned this but it\u2019s worth repeating because it can be confusing if you don\u2019t follow this every day. For 2012, on a pure operating basis our OEM is projected roughly flat, however, when you see our financial reports each quarter you\u2019ll actually see a decline in overall OEM because of the rate plan which caused for us to cease amortization over the course of 2012 of 148.1 million of regulatory assets. So everyone should keep that in mind but in terms of just the trend of real OEM from real operations 2012 we expect to be flat.", "Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris", "Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re welcome, Andy.", "Operator", "Ted Hayden with Point State Capital, you may proceed with your question.", "Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital", "Good afternoon.", "Gale Klappa", "Hi Ted. Good to see. How are you doing?", "Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital", "Doing well. I\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to bet you on a football game this fourth quarter and lose. So appreciate the time, I had just one quick question on 2011. What was your earned ROE at Webco?", "Gale Klappa", "If you remember our allowed ROE at the electric side of the business is 10.4. Our allowed ROE on the natural gas distribution side of the business is 10.5 and if you look overall, we were very, very close to our allowed ROE.", "Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital", "And is that on the 6 billion of rate base that you guys have in your December slide deck?", "Gale Klappa", "We are looking here. Yes.", "Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital", "Okay. And the equity ratio is like 53? It\u2019s a sliding scale I guess, right?", "Gale Klappa", "Pat, we had 52.2%, 53% up in utilities?", "Patrick Keyes", "53.5 is the high end. We were underneath that.", "Frederick Kuester", "Midpoint is 51.", "Gale Klappa", "Yeah, our allowed range is 51% to 53.5%. As Pat said we were just under the 53.5%.", "Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital", "Got you. Okay and then I\u2019m assuming the guidance for 2012 assumes the 10.4, 10.5 blended as well?", "Gale Klappa", "Well it assumes we can come close.", "Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital", "Come close? Okay so maybe a little bit of lag?", "Gale Klappa", "Yes.", "Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital", "Okay. Great. That was it. Thanks a lot.", "Gale Klappa", "You\u2019re more than welcome Ted.", "Operator", "Your final question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Gale Klappa", "Welcome back Michael.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Hey Gale. I want \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind come back to the CapEx question and you talked the 2011 to 2015 and then the 2012 to 2016, 3.4 billion and the 3.5 billion. I\u2019m just a little confused only because you spent a lot of money on South Oak Creek in 2011 if I remember correctly. But South Oak Creek CapEx kind of stopped soon. I mean, you\u2019re mostly done with that and have done well with getting that project wrapped up on time on budget. So it seems like if I look at the CapEx, you\u2019re replacing a large chunk of CapEx in 2011 tied to South Oak Creek with a lot of reliability and infrastructure. I mean, that\u2019s not a small number. And I just want to see and check to make sure I\u2019m understanding that correctly not making a mistake in kind of thinking about the timeline for when you spent dollars on South Oak Creek.", "Gale Klappa", "Very good question. And let me break it down for you. Rick and I have got a slide here which really, I think, details it quite well. You are correct. We are virtually complete with our spending on the South Oak Creek air quality control upgrade, and that is a very large project. When you look at our estimated 2011 spending on our rate-based infrastructure, it was about $420 million.", "For 2012, it\u2019s about a $50 million increase. We\u2019re projecting to spend $473 million on basic infrastructure work at our utilities, replacing aging gas distribution lines, replacing substation transformers, that kind of stuff. So we\u2019re seeing, compared to 2011, about a $50 million increase in infrastructure spend. Then we\u2019re projecting, as we show on the slides here that you can get on our website too, we\u2019re projecting about $160 million of spending on renewable which is largely, Rick, the Rothschild Biomass Plant.", "Frederick Kuester", "That\u2019s correct.", "Gale Klappa", "And then, we have about another $70 million on top of that of environmental spend, environmental CapEx. So that takes you the number Rick mentioned about $705 million of projected capital spend in 2012 in kind of the categories\u2019 breakdown.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. All right, I\u2019m with you guys. One last question, I just wanted to make sure I understood. On the debt side, besides what you do with the utility, is what\u2019s in plan a reduction of HoldCo level interest and the HoldCo level debt or flat?", "Frederick Kuester", "In 2012, it will be basically flat.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Okay, and beyond like how you were thinking about 2013 and beyond?", "Frederick Kuester", "Yeah, let me rephrase. We did, as I mentioned in the script, we retired $450 million at the HoldCo in April. So there will be effect to that but we won\u2019t be retiring any new debt in 2012. So we\u2019ll have the effective retire net debt back in the last April, Michael.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "Frederick Kuester", "And Michael, let me go back if I can to maybe help clarify one additional point on the capital spend question you had. With our projection of about $705 million of capital spending in 2012, that\u2019s materially below the actual spend for 2011.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay, I\u2019m just \u2013 it strikes me your \u2013 the way I\u2019m reading it is, come 2013 and 2014, it\u2019s a big jump off in retirement, $400 million a year and reliability spend, kind of core spend because you\u2019re rolling off some of the enviro and some of the renewable spend.", "Frederick Kuester", "You\u2019re absolutely correct and let me give you the projections. I mentioned $473 million in 2012 on the basic reliability, I mean, the basic core business capital spend. That jumps in our projections to $611 million in 2013 and about $585 million in 2014. So yes, you\u2019re in the right direction with your intuition.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Have seen and then checked this with the PSC.", "Frederick Kuester", "Oh, we \u2013 let me put it this way, every project of any kind of magnitude. Any project that\u2019s of \u2013 what is our threshold on the electric side guys that we take the commission, $7 million, that was $7 million.", "Patrick Keyes", "I would say $8 million.", "Gale Klappa", "$7 million or $8 million.", "Patrick Keyes", "$8 million, yeah.", "Gale Klappa", "We have a capital project that is above $7 million or $8 million of capital spend. We historically, in the way regulation has worked here, we take that project for approval \u2013 individual project approval to the commission. And once that project is approved in the 110-year history of regulation in this state, cost recovery for an approved project that you bring in on time and on budget has never been denied.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.", "Patrick Keyes", "So Michael, if you look at actually what we\u2019re doing \u2013 if you look at the installation history of the company and when a lot of this stuff we\u2019re replacing was installed, look at the age of what we\u2019re replacing, it\u2019s time to be doing this. I mean we\u2019re talking 50-year-old transformers. We\u2019re talking poles that are in excess of 60 years old. We\u2019re talking upgrading of the gas pipelines, putting better material in. So this is infrastructure improvement that needs to be made based on material conditions out there.", "Gale Klappa", "We have equipment here older than Mr. Goldman or Mr. Sachs.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Understood. Okay. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "Michael.", "Gale Klappa", "All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. We certainly appreciate your taking part. If you have any other questions, don\u2019t hesitate to call Colleen Henderson. Colleen will be available in our Investor Relations office at 414-221-2592.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review the company\u2019s 2012 first quarter results.", "Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of We Generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Pat Keyes, our Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, Controller. Susan, of course, was recently promoted to the General Counsel position. She succeeds Jim Fleming, who retired just a few weeks ago.", "Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.74 a share for the first quarter of 2012. This compares with earnings of $0.72 a share for the first quarter of 2011.", "Weather of course both regionally and nationally was the big story in the opening quarter of 2012. For Wisconsin Energy, the warmest winter in 122 years drove down residential demand for natural gas by nearly 24% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, sharply lower demand for natural gas prompted us to revise our first quarter earnings guidance on March 29. At the same time, we also reaffirmed our full year forecast.", "Now, although the weather was a dominant factor in our first quarter results, there were several bright spots that I\u2019d like to briefly touch on. First, we had a positive swing of $17 million from the recovery of fuel costs in the quarter compared with the first quarter of 2011. We also recorded significantly lower operation and maintenance costs. That\u2019s largely because of the one-year holiday on regulatory amortizations approved by the Wisconsin Commission in the order that froze our base rates for 2012. We also had lower interest costs and there was an uptick in electric sales to our largest customers.", "Turning now to the economy. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate at 6.8% in March, remains well below the national average. And as I mentioned, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by 3% in the first quarter of 2012. The sector is showing particular strength in the past quarter include iron ore mining, heavy equipment manufacturing, and for the first time since the recession, the producers of rubber and plastic products.", "We\u2019re also seeing a rebound in new customer connections. Compared to the low level of activity during the recession, electric customer connections were up 29% and connections of new natural gas customers rose by 33% over the 12-months ended March.", "On the construction front, we have two major projects underway, the 50-megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin and the air quality control upgrade at the original Oak Creek units. We\u2019re making excellent progress on the biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin. We\u2019ve already topped out the structural steel for the boiler and the steel structure for the turbine and fuel storage buildings are now 90% complete. Construction of the cooling tower is underway as well as excavation work for the auxiliary boiler.", "As I\u2019ve noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. We\u2019ll be able to dispatch the unit in the efficient technology that will produce steam for the operating paper mill of the site will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment of the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We\u2019re on schedule and on budget and meet the completion date by the end of 2013.", "Of course, the biomass project and Glacier Hills Wind Park that we completed late last year are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin\u2019s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity delivered from renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level.", "The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using an historical baseline. Using that baseline approximately 8.27% of our retail sales of electricity must come from renewable sources in the year 2015. When we complete the biomass project, we\u2019ll be well positioned to meet that 2015 standard. I should point out, however, that we expect to deplete our bank of renewable credits and as a result, we expect to need additional credits or additional renewable generation in the year 2017.", "Finally, we\u2019re in the last stages of completing the air quality control upgrade for the older coal-fired units at our Oak Creek site. The four older units at Oak Creek are still among the most efficient base load units in the Midwest. So the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities.", "This is the second largest construction project in the company\u2019s history and I\u2019m pleased to report that the wet scrubber and the selective catalytic reduction equipment for Units 5 and 6 at Oak Creek were placed into commercial service on March 3. This state-of-the-art equipment is performing well. It\u2019s performing as we expected and we\u2019re meeting or exceeding all of the applicable emission standards.", "For Units 7 and 8 at Oak Creek, we\u2019re now focused on initial tuning and testing of the new air quality controls. We\u2019re targeting an in-service date for the Unit 7 and 8 controls later this summer and we remain on budget for the project.", "Now I\u2019d like to spend just a moment on the impact we\u2019re seeing from the current conditions in the coal and natural gas markets. As all of you know, natural gas prices are at extremely low levels. At this point, spot prices are about $2.35 per million Btu and forward prices for the summer are in the $2.35 to $2.55 per million Btu range. This is clearly influencing locational marginal prices in the MISO market.", "But over the years, the key to successfully serving customers at competitive prices has been fuel diversity, and fuel diversity was the major focus of our Power of the Future plan. You may remember that the plan called for the retirement of nearly 600 megawatts of older less efficient coal-fired capacity. At the same time, the new capacity that we added was almost equally balanced between natural gas and coal. Of the approximately 2,200 megawatts that we built in the past decade, 1,090 megawatts was natural gas fired combined cycle capacity and 1,056 megawatts was highly efficient pulverized coal capacity.", "Another important point. About 80% of the coal that we use is Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal. Although the new Oak Creek expansion units are currently fueled with bituminous coal, we\u2019re seeking the flexibility to burn blends of bituminous and sub-bituminous coal there in the future.", "Overall, we\u2019re projecting to burn just under 9 million tons of coal this year versus 10.7 million tons in 2011. We\u2019ll achieve this reduction by carrying out planned burns, maximizing the use of storage and working with our coal suppliers to defer, buy out or renegotiate several existing contracts.", "Natural gas will take up the slack. Our natural gas burn is expected to nearly double from 28.5 Bcf last year to 50 Bcf this year. In fact, our natural gas units at Port Washington operated at about a 60% capacity factor in the first quarter of this year. The Port Washington units are essentially now being dispatched in the MISO market as baseload units. So overall, I believe we\u2019re well positioned to adjust as the markets for coal and natural gas continue to evolve and for calendar year 2012, we expect to fully recover our fuel costs.", "Now I\u2019ll briefly review where we stand on the regulatory fronts in both Wisconsin and Michigan. As you may recall, our electric customers in Wisconsin are seeing no increase in base rates during 2012. We developed a creative approach to push off for a year an increase in base rates as the economy continues to recover here.", "Looking ahead, we have filed a rate request with the Wisconsin Commission, seeking an increase for electric and steam customers for 2013 and 2014 and a decrease in base rates for our natural gas customers in 2013.", "The base rate adjustments we\u2019re seeking are driven by approximately $1.6 billion of capital investments that the Commission previously approved, the strength and reliability to meet environmental requirements and to comply with Wisconsin\u2019s renewable energy mandate.", "Projects previously approved by the Commission include the air quality control system for the older units at Oak Creek, the Glacier Hills Wind Park, the biomass facility in Northern Wisconsin and the Oak Creek expansion units. Our proposal in this particular rate case includes using a federal grant that we expect to receive for our biomass facility. After applying this cash grant, the result would be a net customer bill impact of a 3.6% increase in 2013 and another 3.6% in 2014.", "Our filing also includes an estimate of fuel costs for 2013, but that\u2019s simply a placeholder at this point because our fuel cost projections will be updated and finalized later this year.", "On the natural gas distribution front, we proposed a decrease in the base rates for customers of our two gas distribution utilities in the year 2013. We\u2019re seeking a 2.3% decrease for Wisconsin Gas customers and a 0.2% decrease for Wisconsin Electric Gas customers. For 2014, we\u2019re proposing the base rates then remain flat.", "For our steam utility, we filed for an increase in 2013 of approximately 6% for our downtown Milwaukee customers and approximately 7% for our Milwaukee County customers. In 2014, our proposal calls for an increase of 6% for both of those customer groups.", "We expect the Wisconsin Commission to hold technical hearings on our requests later this year and to issue orders before the end of 2012. We\u2019ve requested that the new rates go into effect at the start of 2013 and 2014 respectively. We\u2019ll keep you updated as developments unfold.", "Turning now to our Michigan operations. You\u2019ll recall that in July of 2011, we filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for an annual rate increase of $17.5 million. We\u2019re seeking to recover from Michigan customers their pro rata share of renewable generation, environmental controls and costs associated with the second expansion unit at Oak Creek.", "In late December, the Commission decided or directed, I should say, the company to self-implement a $5.7 million rate increase that took effect on January 5, 2012. The Commission\u2019s directive also authorized the company to implement a $2.7 million credit of the proceeds we received from a settlement with the Department of Energy. Applying the credit, the net effect of the interim rate increase is $3 million or about 1.7%.", "We expect the Michigan Commission to rule on our entire request by July 5 of this year. In addition, approximately $2 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate and that was effective January 1 of this year. So the total self-implementation was $7.7 million annually.", "Switching gears now, a quick reminder that our board has authorized a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013 that calls for us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. No purchases were made under the plan in the first quarter of this year. Through today, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $100 million. That equates to an average purchase price of $30.79 a share.", "And as we previously announced, our board has adopted a dividend policy that calls for us to reach a 60% payout ratio in the year 2014. This policy should support double-digit growth in the dividend in both 2013 and 2014 as we work to achieve a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. We took another major step forward in January by approving a dividend increase of 15% bringing our new dividend rate for 2012 to $1.20 a share.", "And finally, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss the investment opportunities we have in our core business. Our latest capital budget calls for spending $3.5 billion over the five-year period 2012 through 2016. In our 2012 through 2016 budget, the nature of our capital investments is shifting, shifting away from an emphasis on generation involving high profile projects such as our Power of the Future units, renewable generation and large air quality controls.", "Instead, our capital plan is primarily comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. The building blocks of our delivery business, pipes, polls, wires, transformers. The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory, construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the mega projects we\u2019ve just completed. Our focus on upgrading and renewing our distribution facilities is essential for maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest.", "So in summary, as we look back at the first quarter, our customers enjoyed basking in Miami-like weather in January, February, and March and we continue to make solid progress on our financial and operational goals.", "Now before I turn the call over to Rick, I\u2019m pleased to share with you one more piece of good news. For the fifth year in a row, Wisconsin Energy was named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States by Corporate Responsibility Magazine.", "On that note, here\u2019s our Chief Financial Officer and a darn fine citizen in his own right, Rick Kuester. Rick?", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Thanks, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2012 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.74 a share compared to $0.72 a share in 2011. You will notice that our net income increased by just over $1 million. However, earnings per share increased by $0.02. This increase reflects the impact of our share repurchase program, which began in 2011. We estimate that the share repurchases we completed in 2011 will boost our earnings for the full-year 2012 by $0.03 per share.", "Now as we take a closer look at the numbers, I will focus on the earnings drivers at the operating income level by business segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows in the quarter.", "Our consolidated operating income in the first quarter of 2012 was $296 million, which was the same as first quarter of 2011. Starting with Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income totaled $209 million, a decrease of $4 million versus 2011. The most significant factor in the quarter was the record warmth that we experienced. The quarter ended with slightly cooler temperatures during the last three days, which help boost us to $0.20 \u2013 excuse me to $0.74 a share.", "We estimate that our electric and gas margins were reduced by $49 million as compared to last year and $34 million as compared to normal weather. Partially offsetting the impact of weather were our collections on fuel, which improved by $17 million as compared to 2011 and a reduction in our O&M costs of $25 million at the utility level.", "We had favorable first quarter fuel recoveries because our fuel filing request was approved on January 5 of this year. Last year, our fuel filing request was not approved until late April. The reduction in O&M cost is related to the one-year amortization holiday of certain regulatory assets. As you will remember from prior calls, last year we reached an agreement with the Wisconsin Commission that allowed us to freeze base electric rates in 2012.", "One of the provisions in the agreement was the ability to stop the amortization of approximately $148 million associated with regulatory assets. This action will reduce O&M by $148 million during 2012, which will flow evenly through the year. This agreement was designed to help our customers afford price increases in this economy and allow shareholders to earn returns on the capital projects that Gale discussed earlier.", "Operating income in the Non-Utility Energy segment, which consists primarily of the Power the Future units was up by $4 million. Unit 2 at Oak Creek was placed in service on January 12, 2011 so we realized a full quarter\u2019s earnings on the unit in 2012. Last year, we only realized a partial quarter\u2019s earnings on Unit 2.", "In addition, we finalized the depreciable loss of these units, which had a slight positive impact on earnings. The increased earnings in the Non-Utility segment offset the reduced earnings from the Utility. Our corporate and other segment were also unchanged from the prior year, which gets us back to level consolidated operating income.", "During the first quarter of 2012, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased just slightly over 2011. Our other income increased slightly because of higher AFUDC associated with the air quality control project and the biomass project.", "Net interest expense decreased by $4 million. We saw a reduction in our gross interest expense as we retired $450 million in holding company debt in April 2011. Consolidated income tax expense rose by approximately $7 million because of higher pre-tax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $172 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2012 or earnings of $0.74 per share.", "During the quarter, we generated $361 million of funds from operations, which is a $7 million increase from the same period in 2011. This year\u2019s cash flows were helped because no contributions were needed for our qualified benefit plans. Those plans are fully funded. In the first quarter of last year, we contributed $122 million to our qualified plans. This item was offset by several smaller charges, including a reduction in regulatory amortizations of $37 million associated with the amortization holiday discussed previously.", "Our total capital expenditures increased by approximately $7 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. We saw increased expenditures associated with the biomass plant and within our coal utility operations. The warm weather did allow us to get a head start for the year on our capital projects.", "We also paid $69 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2012, which was $8 million greater than the same period last year. As Gale mentioned, the first quarter dividends equate to an annual dividend of $1.20 per share, which is a 15% increase over the prior year\u2019s annual dividend of $1.04 per share.", "Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 53.3% as of March 31, 2012. Our adjusted calculations treat half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401-K plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "As shown in the earnings package on our website, our actual first quarter 2012 retail sales of electricity decreased by 1% as compared to the same quarter a year ago. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter 2012 retail electric sales were up 1.1%. Excluding the mines, normalized first quarter sales increased by 0.3%. As you recall, we had two customers that are utilizing their own self-generation in 2012. Adjusting for these customers and the mines on a normalized basis, we saw retail sales grow by 0.6%. Overall, these results were in line with our 2012 sales forecast.", "As we look at our natural gas sales, we saw retail sales decrease almost 24% during the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to the warm winter. Excluding the effects of weather, our natural gas sales are in line with our annual forecasts.", "Our 2012 earnings guidance remains the same as we what provided to you on our February conference call. We expect our earnings for 2012 to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.29 per share. While our first quarter earnings fell below our original guidance because of record warm weather, we have taken actions to control spending and we have seen lower fuel and purchased power cost driven by the low natural gas prices. In addition, our interest costs are projected to be lower than originally forecasted.", "Before I turn things back over to Gale, I would like to provide quarterly guidance. Factoring in lower sales in April due to weather, we estimate second quarter earnings will be in the $0.40 to $0.43 per share range.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Rick, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "And now, we would like to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with Konolige Research.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Hi, Kit. Good afternoon.", "Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research", "", "Good afternoon to all you at Miami on Lake Michigan.", "Gale Klappa", "", "There you go.", "Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research", "", "All right. Good for golf, right. So I think Rick you mentioned no issuance of shares. Can we extrapolate from the first quarter that there\u2019s no share repurchases likely at the current stock price?", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Well, Kit, I wouldn\u2019t start extrapolating. I guess, I would back up and just say we \u2013 because of the free cash flow that we have, we\u2019ve identified a number of uses for that cash. First and foremost is to reinvest in our business. Second, is to increase our dividend and as you\u2019re aware we\u2019ve accelerated our target to get to 60% by a year. So we\u2019ll be there in 2014. Then we\u2019re looking opportunistically at basically buying shares or reducing debt at the holding company. And we want to make good economic choices. We don\u2019t want to sit on a bunch of cash. We\u2019ve got a program that basically is authorized out through 2013 to buy back shares. And we will continue to look at that every quarter and just see what makes the most sense for shareholders.", "Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research", "", "Okay. Very good. Let me ask one more on sales. Can you give us any further color on \u2013 I mean, are you guys able to see whether it\u2019s commercial versus residential that\u2019s the kind of relative weakness as an offset to the somewhat improving industrial sales?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Actually, Kit, because of the unusual weather in Q1, is way more than two standard deviations off norm. We all are a little bit skeptical of how effective the weather normalization techniques that the industry uses really are when you get that far off norm. So I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of stock in the precision of the weather normalized first quarter numbers, but directionally they are correct and every one of the categories is up on a weather normalized basis.", "The one that seems to be at least for the first quarter lagging a little bit would be small commercial but that was not the case last year. So my sense is, when you look at the pickup in industrial demand and when you look at the pickup in the customer connections that I mentioned, we are seeing some stronger economic activity. Rick, anything to add?", "Frederick Kuester", "", "I think you hit it, Gale.", "Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research", "", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Thanks, Kit.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Thanks, Kit.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Gale Klappa", "", "How are you today, Paul?", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Hey, how are you doing?", "Gale Klappa", "", "We\u2019re good.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Just to sort of follow-up on that. I mean I realized it\u2019s more of an art than a science here. But just to make sure I understood this. It\u2019s 0.3% was what the weather normalized sales growth was? Is that correct?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Yeah. That\u2019s excluding the mines.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Excluding the mines and with the mines it\u2019s about 0.6%?", "Gale Klappa", "", "I believe that\u2019s correct.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Okay. And does that include leap year?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Yes, it does include leap year.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Okay. So it would actually be negative if we were to take out the effect of leap year, right?", "Gale Klappa", "", "You could probably come to that conclusion. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a firm conclusion. Again, thinking about the deficiency of the technique, the weather normalization technique, when you have this kind of disparity in the weather. My own sense is we\u2019re seeing a little bit stronger pickup particularly on the industrial side and my guess is we\u2019re going to see a bit of a rebound if weather ever comes back to normal here on the commercial side because we did last year, commercial was stronger than we expected last year.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Okay. And then the Prairie Ville I think it is and probably messing this up to Zion line that got approved?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Pleasant Prairie to Zion.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Sorry. Pleasant Prairie to Zion. Could you guys give us any flavors to what you think that might do with respect to congestion and with respect to imports or exports into Illinois?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Sure. We\u2019ll ask Allen Leverett to give you his views since he represents us on the Board of American Transmission Company but let me just for everybody\u2019s sake kind of clarify what Paul\u2019s talking about. The Pleasant Prairie to Zion line is an important link to strengthen the transmission network and relieve some congestion between the very far southern chunk of the state of Wisconsin and Illinois. It\u2019s only about a five-mile line, but an important additional interconnect. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "", "Yes. And, Paul, it\u2019s a 345 kV segment, if you will. I would expect at this point that they would bring it in service in 2014. And effectively, what it will allow us to do, often we get in a situation right now where we have generation that you sort of think of it as being shut in, where you can\u2019t \u2013 if you had no transmission constraint, you\u2019d able to export much more to the south. So it\u2019ll open that up a bit and should result in some savings for our customers. It\u2019s hard to say, Paul, because you don\u2019t know precisely what the situation will be on the transmission system, but I could easily see savings to our customers in say a $15 million to $20 million a year range.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Okay.", "Allen Leverett", "", "From a fuel standpoint. So no earnings, certainly no earnings impact for us, but some nice savings we hope for our customers.", "Gale Klappa", "", "And they would expect to complete both the Illinois and Wisconsin Commissions have now approved the construction of the line and they would expect to complete it before the end of 2013.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "So, good for customers and perhaps a little bit depressing to the power markets in Illinois, all things being equal?", "Gale Klappa", "", "They\u2019re depressed already.", "Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates", "", "Yeah, they are. Thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Jim, how are you today?", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "", "I\u2019m well. Thanks. How are you, guys?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Glad you made it back from London. I was concerned for a while there.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "", "Question, two questions actually. The first one is, when you think about your story prospectively, are you a growth story or a yield story?", "Gale Klappa", "", "I think we\u2019re both. When you think about our risk-adjusted growth profile going forward of 4% to 6% as we\u2019ve said, we think the risk-adjusted returns off that growth are very solid, and then certainly we have, for the next several years, what I would think would be one of, if not the best, dividend growth story in the industry.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "", "So let\u2019s just \u2013 doing the math here, if you\u2019re growing dividends at 10% a year and it\u2019s now 2014, which is where you want to be a 60% payout ratio, you\u2019re talking numbers in the 240 to 245 range, how do you get to that 4% to 6% growth going forward?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Well, I think if you look at the $3.5 billion capital program that we\u2019ve laid out for the period 2012 through 2016, you sprinkle in some opportunistic share buybacks under our share buyback authorization and you assume that we earn close to our allowed rates of return, that\u2019s how we get there.", "Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS", "", "Okay. Second question. I\u2019ll follow up more offline with you on that. Second question is on the current state of the political affairs in Wisconsin. Can you give us an update on the Governor Walker recall campaign as well as the senate recall campaigns?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Sure, I\u2019d be happy to, Jim. Well, first of all, I think the good news is, the endless election cycle is about to come to an end for a while. The dates for the recall election process have been set and the first date is next week actually, when there will be a primary to determine the Democratic candidate who will run against Governor Walker in the recall election.", "Two candidates, well, two principal candidates, there are number of candidates but the two leading candidates on the Democratic side in the polls would be Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk. So they probably will be the two largest vote getters on the Democratic side. Don\u2019t know which will win but we\u2019ll find out very soon. So one of those two candidates likely to face Governor Walker in the recall election and the date for that election has been set for June 5. So June 5 would be the recall election date. In that recall election, there will be a recall election for the governor\u2019s office. There will be a recall election for the lieutenant governor\u2019s office and there will be a recall election for four state senators.", "I think one interesting side note, really, the state legislature has adjourned for the year. So there\u2019s no planned meetings between now and the next election, which should be in November.

One is certainly on the issue you raised, which is renewables. Both of the Democratic candidates for governor have mentioned in their stump speeches that they would want to reemphasize construction of renewable generation particularly wind in Wisconsin. So in my judgment, we probably would see a movement back toward construction of additional renewables to a greater degree under a Democratic administration than under the current administration.

So \u2013 and it dovetails with sort of the list of potential incremental rate base growth projects on Page 20 of your handout. As we look at your plan, you lay out some very clear building blocks that look like all things equal, they get you to at a minimum \u2013 at a bare minimum the low end of your earnings growth aspiration. Is it fair to presume that if you were able to bring any of these sort of six different options to the finish line in lieu of incremental buybacks that that would \u2013 that\u2019s what kind of pushes you to the high end of the growth rate?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Well, as Rick said, priority one is investing in the core business.

A couple of questions and this maybe an Allen question. Thinking about the ATC CapEx forecast for the next few years. Just curious, why the downward trajectory?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Allen is looking at a page right now in front of him.", "Allen Leverett", "", "Well, this doesn\u2019t have the capital. But in terms of the capital projection, I think that they finished a number of pretty large projects, Michael, and as you know, the transmission investments are pretty lumpy. So they finished those big projects and now the sort of next big projects that are on the horizon, you probably heard them talk about the \u2013 or heard us talk about Madison-LaCrosse. That\u2019s a big 345 kV line east west. So that\u2019s really the next big project that\u2019s out there. And then you have to go to 2015, 2016 to sort of see another really big round of projects. So I think, at this point, strictly because of the lumpiness of the investments.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "So is it pretty safe to assume that, I mean, kind of the $38 million to $40 million a year rate base growth. So you get a little bit of earnings growth contribution out of ATC longer term. Is ATC up year-over-year? Like when I think about your 2012 guidance, is ATC\u2019s contribution higher in 2012 than 2011? It was relatively flat in the first quarter, so I just want to kind of check through that.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Up slightly in 2012 over 2011, but I think to Allen\u2019s point, Michael, maybe there\u2019s a couple of time differentiators that we can do to here, because clearly, ATC has announced about a $4 billion capital plan over the next 10 years. That\u2019s materially larger than their last 10. But as Allen pointed out, they\u2019re coming off completing very significant various investments. They have a bit of, from that standpoint, a bit of a lower capital spend in the next four or five years, and then it ramps us materially again because of the lumpiness and the time it takes to site and construct.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. Two last -", "Frederick Kuester", "", "One last thing on the ATC earnings, Michael, they are in line, over the next five years, they are in line with our 4% to 6% growth rate.

Last item. You\u2019re benefiting from \u2013 and I\u2019d love if you could just kind of repeat a little bit, you\u2019ve talked about this prior \u2013 from significant cash inflows related to deferred taxes. You got a big cash inflow I think earlier in the first quarter. Can you just talk about that in terms of what\u2019s embedded in that kind of cash flow statement item in 2012 in your guidance level for 2012? And then how should we think about what happens longer term?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Let me first, Michael, talk about the longer term and I think probably the best way to capsulize it is that based on our projections, we expect to have approximately $600 million of free cash flow over the period 2012 through 2016. And our definition of free cash flow would be after capital spending and after dividends. So after capital spending and after dividends, about $600 million of free cash between now and 2016. Frankly, the year-to-year breakdown is kind of immaterial here because it depends upon the level of capital spending and the timing of capital spending in any given year. So I think probably our best explanation to you is just that, the 2012 through 2016, approximately $600 million.", "Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay. Can you also talk about the deferred tax benefit in 2012 because I know there was a \u2013 I thought there was a big cash inflow expected in the first quarter related to some of the new Oak Creek units. I just want to make sure I\u2019m kind of following the cash flows this year correctly.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Certainly, I know what you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ll let Steve Dickson mention this to you but the influx of cash I don\u2019t believe is a first quarter event here.", "Stephen Dickson No. It\u2019s tied to our timing of periodic payments. And basically, as we\u2019ve disclosed in the 10-K is we do not expect to pay federal income taxes this year because of the benefits that we got in depreciation in prior years. So there\u2019s no slug of cash coming in. It\u2019s more of not having to make estimated payments.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "What you might be thinking about, Michael, in the first quarter we announced that we received the private letter ruling from the IRS in December of last year that basically confirmed that accelerated depreciation could be applied to the expansion units, the coal expansion units at Oak Creek site.

You mentioned the share repurchase would have an impact of $0.03 in fiscal year 2012 and I just wondered if there\u2019s an underlying assumption in that or is that just simply the impact of what\u2019s been completed to-date?", "Frederick Kuester", "", "It\u2019s what\u2019s been completed to date, which was back in \u2013 last year.

And then, Gale, just revisiting an earlier question they took you through slide 20 of your recent slide deck. And what\u2019s not in CapEx currently that you identified, were you to go forward with that, would reduce the share repurchase, right? So we shouldn\u2019t really double count here. If your CapEx does rise, that will limit your ability to repurchase shares holding all things constant.", "Gale Klappa", "", "You\u2019re exactly right, Jay, that\u2019s a very good point, and you are correct.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "That\u2019s perfect. If we can then to switch to the Wisconsin rate case. I know a lot of your peers there in the state are filing rate cases; in fact, all to my recollection.", "Gale Klappa", "", "We\u2019ve got a lot of company, Jay.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "Exactly, sometimes that\u2019s good, sometimes that\u2019s bad. But in the context of that, I wanted to see, is there an opportunity to settle the current case. Yours is a little more complex than some of your peers, but just wanted to have your early read on the ability to settle it, if you could.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Well, good question, Jay. I think first of all, the history in Wisconsin is not one of settlements. I don\u2019t think actually there\u2019s been a settled rate case in the nine years our team has been here for any of the Wisconsin utilities that I\u2019m aware of. I think there may be one other utility that thinks they can come close to zero this year that might be able to do a settlement. So I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a high probability of a settlement in the rate case. However, there is a lot of work going on by the Commission staff, by all of the utilities and by the intervener groups to try to narrow the issues that will be contested in the case.", "And from that standpoint, I think our case is very straightforward. I mentioned earlier, the case is really driven by about $1.6 billion of capital investment that was previously approved by the Commission that has come into service that is now serving customers is used and useful and we brought those projects in essentially on time and on budget. So that actually simplifies the case a tremendous amount. So I would say, in our case, there won\u2019t be but about three or four, maximum five contested issues and the parties will nail down those issues in a prehearing conference starting on May 21.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "Okay. That is great. Thank you. And then last question, I guess, for Rick, but anyone can chime in. So regarding the guidance and you sort of indicated that the weather in the first quarter is weighing against you, things like O&M and fuel recoveries as well as lower interest cost will help you over the balance of the year. I wanted to talk about two of those items. O&M first, just what are our incremental opportunities from here as you continue to squeeze costs out? Is it it\u2019s always there and we can just squeeze more? Or is it in fact a finite opportunity?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Well, I\u2019ll start. Rick, Pat, Allen can certainly chime in. The big driver in the O&M reduction this year, just to refresh everyone\u2019s memory, is embedded in our rate order that froze electric rates for customers through 2012. Basically, we asked for and received permission to stop amortizing $148 million of regulatory assets over the course of 2012 and that order allows us to stop the amortization in equal quarterly increments.", "So for example, I think, the number this quarter was $37 million and people are nodding their head yes. So you can expect a comparable number when we report in terms of O&M reduction from that item when we report in Q2, Q3, and Q4. That\u2019s the big driver this year. We\u2019ve also asked all of our major business functions to operate at no O&M increase and in some cases, an O&M decrease for 2012. We\u2019re on target with those initiatives. Rick?", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Yeah. I would also say, Jay, that last year, we had a hot summer and we released some projects at the end of the year. For example, there was a major turbine rebuild that needed to be done. So some of those projects that are episodic in nature won\u2019t be flowing through at the end of this year. So, there\u2019ll be \u2013 you\u2019ll see probably a more positive benefit from O&M in the second half of the year than you would in the first half of the year.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Very good point.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "That\u2019s great. Very helpful. And then the last question just on the lower fuel recoveries. I assume you have baked into that your concept of plan to burn, and I wouldn\u2019t mind it if you sort of expanded upon that on just how you \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of different definitions floating around of economic and planned burn when you\u2019re talking to some of these coal burns. So if you would talk about that and then I assume that\u2019s baked in here, but obviously as fuel costs change that may impact that. So, if you just can give us a little clarity on that.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Sure, Jay. Very good question and let me just frame it and then we\u2019ll let Allen provide you the details. What is baked into our guidance now for the remainder of the year is an assumption that we will fully recover our fuel costs. That there won\u2019t be any reduction of earnings from a lack of recovery of fuel cost. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks related to our coal deliveries and our coal costs, we had a variety of initiatives underway ranging from planned burns to turn back of coal to some buyouts. Allen, I know we have ongoing discussions with the coal companies.", "Allen Leverett", "", "Right. And, Jay, we talked \u2013 or Gale talked about in the script that we\u2019re going to probably bring the burn from about 10.7 million tons last year to just under 9 million this year. And then Gale talked about the range of things we would do to try to achieve that. We\u2019ll certainly try to pick the mix of those things that are best from an economic standpoint for our customers. My view right now is that we would be more heavily weighted to doing the defer buyout renegotiate route for existing contracts as opposed to the planned burn route or storage route.", "But we\u2019ll just have to see kind of where the numbers take us. When we say planned burn though, Jay, what we mean by that is you basically would target a number of tons that you would want to burn and then given where we are right now, or at least where we\u2019re forecasted to be with location and marginal prices, we would actually discount our offer in the market.", "So we would discount the offer that we would put in for that unit when we put it in to MISO into the day ahead market so that we\u2019d get enough run time to burn through much coal. So you\u2019d actually be discounting, if you will, your offer price in order to achieve a certain level of burn. I\u2019m making sense.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "No. That makes a lot of sense and I appreciate that. Just on the point you offered Allen, if you were to work on renegotiating the contract assuming economic principles prevail, that would essentially just be pushing out the impact into future years.", "Allen Leverett", "", "Not necessarily.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Not necessarily. No.", "Allen Leverett", "", "In some cases, it could be a push-out of deliveries. In other cases, it might just be well, you just pay liquidated damages and you just turn back the deliveries completely and you\u2019re not committed to taking that delivery in a future period. So it could be a mix of those two.", "Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities", "", "Hey. That\u2019s great. Thanks so much for the clarity. I really appreciate it.", "Gale Klappa", "", "You\u2019re welcome. Good questions.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Bischof with Morningstar.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Good afternoon, Andy.", "Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call.", "Gale Klappa", "", "You\u2019re welcome. How are you doing today?", "Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Good. How are you?", "Gale Klappa", "", "We\u2019re well.", "Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Just one remaining question. You kind of highlighted your distribution investments. If you can maybe provide some clarity on your discussions with state regulators and any insight on your ability to get pre-approval for those projects.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Certainly. Let me first say that there is a what we call a CA process, the construction authority process that has been practiced by the Wisconsin Commission going back decades and decades. So if you have a distribution project that, I believe guys the number is $10 million, now they just raised it on the electric side. So let\u2019s just take electric as an example here. If you have a distribution project, capital project to improve or upgrade or rehab a part of the network that costs $10 million or more, you must seek authority and pre-approval from the Wisconsin Commission staff.", "So we will have literally over the course of the next five years hundreds of these applications that will go the Wisconsin Commission staff and hundreds may be stretching it because it may not all individually come to $10 million, but we will have a significant number of these pre-approval requests. The requests are very thoroughly done. They document the rationale for why the upgrade is needed. And in our case, all of these relate to maintaining the reliability of the network and replacing aging infrastructure.", "Let me give you just a couple of examples. Between now and 2016, we would plan to rebuild 2,500 miles of electric distribution lines that today are more than 50 years old. We would plan to replace about 28,000 power poles, about 28,000 transformers that are beyond their design life and literally hundreds of substation components and that\u2019s on the electric side of the business.", "On the natural gas side of the business, again, between now and 2016, we would plan to replace 1,250 miles of fiberglass, plastic and steel gas mains. We would plan to replace about 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and almost a quarter of a million meter sets on the natural gas distribution side of the business. So that just gives you some flavor of the kinds of projects. Anything under $10 million, we would not necessarily seek pre-approval for, $10 million or above on the electric side, we would. And I might add that in the history of this Commission, if they pre-approve a project and you bring it in on time and on budget, they have never denied cost recovery.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "While a lot of those project may not get pre-approval, they will be in our rate case that we file with our two-year forward-looking (inaudible).", "Gale Klappa", "", "Exactly.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Window, so.", "Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Okay. I appreciate that. And I\u2019m assuming they share your need of the distribution investments going forward?", "Gale Klappa", "", "The they share our concerns?", "Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar", "", "Yes.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Any time that you demonstrate a need to maintain reliability, it\u2019s generally well received. The Commission certainly understands the importance for a reliable network.", "Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar", "", "I appreciate the questions.", "Gale Klappa", "", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Good afternoon, Paul.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "Good afternoon. First of all, what was the absolute fuel recovery as opposed to the year-over-year?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Absolute fuel recovery I believe was $17.5 million.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "So last year, was it just about flat, neutral?", "Gale Klappa", "", "I\u2019m sorry?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Yeah.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "Last year was \u2013 you just about broke even on it.", "Gale Klappa", "", "The first quarter was about level, about even.", "Allen Leverett", "", "Right.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "And then second question is I think it\u2019s Presque Isle has transmission constraints that could be an opportunity.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Yes, but the entire \u2013 and I\u2019ll let Allen give you the details but there is a northern plan that American Transmission Company has proposed. The northern third of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have historically had weak transmission infrastructure. There\u2019s been some investment already. But clearly, when we look at the future, there is no question that there has to be additional transmission, particularly for, again, at the northern chunk of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to maintain reliability. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "", "Yeah. I think, Paul, Gale may have mentioned earlier that ATC\u2019s 10-year plan would call \u2013 within their footprint, which includes the UP of Michigan as well as Wisconsin, calls for $4 billion worth of capital spending. Roughly a quarter of that $4 billion is to address these issues that you and Gale were alluding to in the UP of Michigan.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "Is that \u2013 what\u2019s the sense of urgency? Is that something that could be taken up earlier?", "Allen Leverett", "", "Well, certainly, stepping back, we have an issue right now, even with the Presque Isle facility there. So there\u2019s certainly a set of improvements that I think are quite urgent and should be pursued now. And ATC is seeking to get out-of-cycle review with MISO on those projects. I would say, Paul, roughly, that\u2019s probably $250 million worth of projects. It\u2019s that kind of zip code. But then the rest of them would be over a period of time.", "Now, there are as you would expect, there are competing proposals, if you will. So I\u2019m sure that ITC would like to build some facilities up from the Lower Peninsula to the Upper Peninsula. So I mean there are competing proposals out there but there\u2019s some of this that really needs to be done in the short term even with the Presque Isle plant there.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "What do you define as short term?", "Allen Leverett", "", "Well, if we get out-of-cycle review, I would say at latest they would get review by end of this year on those early stage projects. And then I would say if they got approval, Paul, those projects would probably be in place in the 2017 timeframe.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "Okay. And switching gears, you talk about $148 million amortization holiday, $37 million per quarter but O&M only improved $25 million. Is that $12 million delta what we can expect for the balance of the year kind of on a quarterly basis?", "Gale Klappa", "", "No. Again, as Rick pointed out to you, when you\u2019re comparing quarter-to-quarter this year versus last year, we\u2019re going to see from the initiatives we have in place and from some of the projects that were one-time only projects in the fourth quarter of last year, you\u2019re going to see an improvement in that direction in the second half of the year. Rick?", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Yeah. One thing that caused O&M to tick up a little bit is we \u2013 because of the warm weather, we\u2019ve got ahead on a number of our inspections, required inspections, in our regulated business side. And as I said earlier because of projects that we released at the end of last year, we\u2019re going to see improvement year-over-year I think in the second half of the year from an O&M standpoint.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "And then lastly, any update on the ash ponds spill?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Well that is \u2013 in terms of the \u2013 are you talking about the Oak Creek bluff?", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "Yes.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Okay. Yes. Really the response was very efficient, very quick. And if you had gone to the site, this happened on Halloween, October 31, 2011. If you had gone to the site one month later, you would never have known that anything occurred. So we are \u2013 the response again was great. 95% of the coal ash and dirt that fell down the bluff stayed on our property. There was no harm to the aquatic environment. No harm to the lake and so we\u2019re wrapping that up right now in discussions with the Department of Natural Resources and we would expect a full resolution certainly within the next few months.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "And just one clarification. We don\u2019t have any wet ash ponds, Paul. This was ash that was stored or land filled in a ravine back in the 1950s and 1960s when it was entirely okay to do that. And so it was one pocket of ash that basically let loose. And as Gale said, we were able to clean it up with 95% of it being taken to a landfill.", "Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc", "", "Thanks for the clarification.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Dan, I assume that you\u2019re following your normal pattern voting early and often.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "Yeah, I am originally from Illinois.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Yeah, well, be careful, you\u2019ll ruin your fingernails doing those license plates I understand. How are you doing, Dan?", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "Fine. How about you?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Yeah, we\u2019re fine. What can we do for you?", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "I have a couple of questions. First, you talked a little bit about the increase in customer connections and I was wondering how that compared to say pre-recession levels. And also is there \u2013 do you have any sense of whether any of that was pulled forward because of the good weather in the first quarter as far as household formation and that kind of thing?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Good questions, Dan. First of all how does this uptick that we\u2019re talking about compare to pre-recession levels. Still well below pre-recession levels. Probably less than half of pre-recession levels at this stage of the game, but encouraging.", "And in your second question about did the warm spring weather pull forward these connections. Perhaps to some degree on electric side, however, the biggest percentage of increase was actually in natural gas connections. And there I think what we\u2019re benefiting from is the comparison of heating your home or your business today with natural gas compared for example to propane or oil. The cost differential has become very significant for customers.", "So I don\u2019t think on the natural gas side with the 33% increase in natural gas connections over the past 12 months compared to the 12-months ended Q1 2011, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s weather. I think that\u2019s customers responding rationally to pricing. On the electric side, maybe some but again we\u2019re just beginning to see a little more stirring of economic activity. Not robust. Not back to where it was pre-recession, but encouraging.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "How does what you saw compare to what you assumed in your plan for 2012? What was your assumption for customer connections?", "Gale Klappa", "", "We don\u2019t have that number in the room with us. But it\u2019s definitely \u2013 we assumed \u2013 I think exactly the same level as last year.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Residential sales declined -", "Gale Klappa", "", "And Rick\u2019s right, we assumed flat residential sales. So we didn\u2019t have much of anything in terms of an uptick in new customer connections compared to last year in our forecast.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "Okay. And then you mentioned on the industrial side that you saw some gains in rubber and plastic area that were kind of the first time you\u2019ve seen that in a while. Perhaps you\u2019d give a little more color on what\u2019s driving that and do you expect it to continue going forward?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Someone asked this morning whether that was automotive related and we don\u2019t have much of any automotive-related rubber and plastic business in our regions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being driven by automotive. More color than that. Another thing it\u2019s a lot of individual companies all across the sector producing rubber and plastic products that have gone up.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "Things like packaging.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Yeah. We have a couple of large packaging manufacturers in our region and I know one of them had a pretty significant uptick in Q1.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "Okay. And then the last thing I was wondering about is looking at the cash flow statement. There was a fairly big drop in the working capital, and I was wondering what\u2019s driving that difference between this year and last year and do you expect that to reverse going forward?", "Gale Klappa", "", "We\u2019ll ask Steve Dickson, our Controller, to answer that for you.", "Stephen Dickson I assume you\u2019re looking at the at the consolidated statement of cash flow and the line item working capital and other?", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "Right.", "Gale Klappa", "Stephen Dickson Yeah, that declined about $139 million quarter-to-quarter. And as Rick mentioned on the call, there\u2019s a lot of really small items in there. One item is, if you remember last year in the first quarter, we received the settlement from the DOE and that increased the regulatory liabilities. So that flowed through as an increase in the cash from operations. Ironically, because we then be restricted it, it was a reduction in investing activities. But that was the largest item. That was about $40 million. Accrued interest was higher last year and that related to the debt that we repaid and there are a bunch of small items, but there is nothing really big other than those two items. Does that make sense?", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "Okay. Sure. How about the reverse or do you expect that \u2013 so were those kind of one-time things than in 2011 that more than affected it then -?", "Gale Klappa", "Stephen Dickson Yeah, the big item, as I said, related to the restricted cash that we received in the DOE refund. That actually turns this year and it\u2019s a reduction of operating cash flow this year. So that item already reversed significantly in the first quarter. So I think last year, there were items, which helped us.", "Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin", "", "Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Great. Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Rock and roll, Vedula. How are you?", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "", "I\u2019m doing well, Gale. Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Good afternoon.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "", "Pretty much hit everything but when we were talking about ATC and we\u2019re talking about lumpiness and particularly in the backend when there\u2019ll be a lot more spending called out in 2016, 2017 or whatever. If I recall properly, I\u2019m just wondering whether the conglomeration of cooperatives, municipals and all the parties that make up ATC whether some of them may not be able to meet their capital calls whereby then you might be able to step in on the margin, be able to incrementally participate more in some of those opportunities in the backend. Do you foresee anything like that or does everybody look like really solid such that if these things happen, pretty much the current proportionality of your ownership versus all the other participants basically stay the same?", "Gale Klappa", "", "Vedula, I think, and Allen can give you some more color as well. I think certainly the way the ATC formula works, when there is capital call, the owner certainly has a right to either meet that capital call or to decline to meet the capital call. And then if they decline to meet the capital call, as you\u2019re indicating, if the other parties then step in, they basically \u2013 the pro rata ownership percentages change.", "Now, one thing to keep in mind and it\u2019s certainly possible that a coop or a municipality or a very tiny owner of ATC might or might not stand up to a capital call down the road but they have by and large very small percentages. Allen?", "Allen Leverett", "", "Yeah. I guess maybe just looking at it in the limit, Vedula, I mean, if you look at all the sort of the say the not-for-profit entities and look at their total ownership, well, it\u2019s less than 10% of ATC. So it\u2019s certainly not a huge part of ATC. Based on the way they have all behaved in the past, they certainly made their capital calls in all but some very, very isolated incidents.", "I think probably a bigger question on their participation going forward is not so much their participation in the inside of the footprint so that $4 billion worth of stuff that we talked about. It\u2019s not so much a question about whether they participate in those, in my mind, it\u2019s more of a question are they going to want to participate in some of these outside of the footprint types of project that ATC is trying to pursue with Duke. I mean, they\u2019re certainly entitled to if they want to help fund those and invest but I think there\u2019s probably a bigger question as to if they\u2019re going to want to do that.", "Frederick Kuester", "", "The other dynamic that may change is ATC basically right now is largely self-funding and as the capital investment steps up, we might see a change there but that\u2019s again, that\u2019s in the second five-year half of our 10-year period.", "Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital", "", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gale Klappa", "", "You\u2019re welcome, Vedula.", "Gale Klappa", "", "Well, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating.

And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Elaine, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review the company's 2012 year-end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of We Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber our Assistant Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $2.35 a share for 2012. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $2.18 a share for 2011. And I'm pleased to report that by virtually every meaningful measure, 2012 was an exceptional year for Wisconsin Energy. From an operations standpoint, we achieved milestones in customer satisfaction, employee safety and network reliability. In fact, we attained our highest customer satisfaction ratings in the past decade, and likely, the best ever. We also achieved the best safety record in the history of the company, and we were named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the eighth time in the past 11 years. I'm also pleased that we were able to dispatch only 1/3 of our employee and contract crews to the New York City area to help restore power in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. We were honored to receive an Edison Electric Institute Emergency Assistance Award in recognition of our response. From a financial standpoint, we delivered solid earnings growth, generated strong cash flow and made significant progress toward a dividend payout that is more competitive with our peers. A number of factors contributed to our record financial performance in 2012. The weather, of course, had a major influence on our results. We began 2012 with the warmest winter in 122 years that was followed by an old-fashioned Midwest summer heatwave. In fact, 2012 was the warmest year on record in our region, breaking a mark that stood since 1931. In addition to the weather, the $1.3 billion we invested on state-of-the-art air-quality controls at our older Oak Creek units and in the new Glacier Hills Wind Park also contributed significantly to our 2012 earnings. Turning now to the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 6.6% as of December remains well below the national average. And although energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, dropped by 0.7% in 2012, this was actually slightly better than our expectations. Our plan for the year projected a decline in sales in our large commercial and industrial group because 2 customers began using their own self-generation. Excluding these 2 customers and the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial sales actually rose by 1.1% for the year. We continued, during 2012, to see strength in several industry sectors including food products, chemical manufacturing, metal fabrication and plastics. An encouraging uptick in new customer connections also continued through the year. New electric service installations were up 8.7% compared to 2011, and connections of new natural gas customers increased by more than 13.2% over the prior year. Now as many of you may know, we have one major construction project well underway. That's our biomass fuel power plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. At this point, construction is 65% complete. We're on schedule and on budget for commercial operation by the end of 2013. We expect the main boiler erection to be completed in the first quarter of this year. Steam turbine and generator have been anchored and grounded in place. Piping and electrical installation continues throughout the site. The switch areas have been energized and connected to the distribution network. The natural gas metering station is now complete and gas is available on the site. And construction of the truck dumpers and the fuel handling systems are well underway. As I've noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable assets. We'll be able to dispatch this unit and the efficient technology that will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the operating paper mill on the site will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Of course, the biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park that we brought into service a year ago are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin's Renewable Portfolio Standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity delivered from renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 20% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using a historical baseline. Applying that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015. We will be well positioned to meet that 2015 standard when we complete the biomass facility. Also, we recently signed agreements for some additional renewable energy credits. Those agreements should allow us to be in compliance with the standard through 2019. And because of favorable market conditions, we plan to purchase more renewable credits, further extending the timeframe that we expect to be in compliance. One final note on renewables, in early December, the Wisconsin Commission approved our purchase of the Mumford wind farm, the transaction we announced last August when we agreed with NextEra Energy Resources to purchase the 30-megawatt wind farm for $27 million. We previously had a power purchase agreement for 85% of the energy from this site, so the transaction did not change our renewable portfolio but it did increase our asset base. The remaining 15% of the output from this wind farm is under a power purchase agreement with another utility that runs through 2021. Turning now to other items of interest. In past quarters, we've discussed the impact on our operations of the coal and natural gas markets. Natural gas prices, of course, have remained at very low levels, influencing the dispatch order and locational marginal pricing in the Midwest power market. Over the years, the key to serving customers at a competitive price has been fuel diversity. And fuel diversity was a core principle of our Power the Future plan. You may remember that our plan called for the addition of 2,200 megawatts of new capacity, capacity that is almost equally balanced between coal and natural gas. So now, with our efficient new capacity in place and natural gas prices at low levels, our natural gas burn in 2012 nearly doubled from 23.9 billion cubic feet in 2011 to 46.5 billion cubic feet in 2012. In fact, our natural gas units at Port Washington operated at a 46% capacity factor for the year 2012. This compares with a 23% capacity factor in 2011. All 4 of the combustion turbines at Port Washington were fired for more than 5,200 hours in 2012, and that, of course, supported a record amount of generation from this site for the year. At times, our Port Washington units were essentially being dispatched as baseload units in MISO. Of course, as our natural gas burns have gone up, our coal burns have naturally come down. We burned approximately 8.3 million tons of coal in 2012 versus 10.7 million tons in 2011. We achieved this reduction by purchasing less coal, maximizing the use of coal storage and working with our coal suppliers to amend existing contracts. In another development, we're seeking a revised air permit that would allow us to blend western and eastern coals at our new Oak Creek expansion units. These units initially were permitted to burn eastern bituminous coal. However, moving to a blend with Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal could significantly, in our estimates, lower fuel cost for our customers. Overall, our diverse fleet and our long-term power purchase agreement for nuclear energy position us, we believe, very well as the power markets continue to evolve. Now, I'll briefly turn to the final results of our Wisconsin rate case. If you remember that in the spring of last year, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission for electric natural gas and steam rates for the years 2013 and 2014. Our request was driven primarily by the investment of approximately $1.6 billion in previously approved capital projects, such as the air quality control system at our older Oak Creek units, the addition of the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the construction of our biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin. The commission completed its assessment in late November and issued a final order on December 20 for rates that went into effect on January 1 of this year. Here are the final results. The commission granted an overall 4.8% increase in base electric rates for 2013 and a 1% increase for 2014. After applying a renewable energy tax grant, and we'll talk more a little bit later about that renewable energy tax grant, but after applying that grant, that we expect to receive after our biomass plant is complete, our customers will see a net bill increase of 2.6% in both 2013 and 2014. In the rate order, the commission also determined that 100% of the construction costs for our Oak Creek expansion units were prudently incurred, and the commission approved the recovery in rates of more than 99.5% of the final cost at Oak Creek. Finally, the commission approved recovery of a 1.6% increase in fuel costs that we expect to see during 2013. For our natural gas distribution business, the commission granted our request for a decrease in natural gas rates for 2013, averaging 1.9% for gas customers of Wisconsin Electric and 5.5% for gas customers of Wisconsin Gas. Those rates will then remain unchanged in 2014. For steam customers, the commission authorized a 6% increase in 2013 and '14 for the Milwaukee downtown utility, and increases of 7% in 2013 and 6% in 2014 for our Wauwatosa steam utility. The commission also maintained our approved capital structures and return on equity. Switching gears now, you'll recall that in 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan that calls for us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The authorization runs through the end of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we repurchased approximately 1,028,000 shares at a cost of $37.8 million. Since the program began, we've repurchased approximately 4,650,000 shares at a cost of $151.8 million. That equates to an average purchase price for the program so far of                             $32.63 a share. And as we look at our dividend policy, earlier this month, our board affirmed our policy that targets a 60% payout ratio in 2014. The board also adopted a follow-on policy targeting a dividend payout ratio that trends to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017. This policy marks an important step toward making our dividend payout more competitive with our peers across the utility industry. It should also support double-digit growth in the dividend in 2014, and 7% to 8% dividend growth in the years 2015 through 2017. And as we reported to you in mid-January, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 a share for the first quarter of this year, which equates to an annual dividend of $1.36 a share. This represents a 13.3% increase over the prior year and is consistent with the dividend policy I've just described. Finally, I'd like to discuss the investment opportunities we see going forward in our core business. Our capital budget, and these are new numbers, our capital budget calls for spending between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion over the 5-year period ending 2017. In this new 5-year budget, the nature of our capital investments continue to shift away from high-profile projects, such as our Power the Future units, renewable generation and large air quality controls. Instead, our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure, the building blocks of our delivery business, pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations. The primary risks, of course, associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory, construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects we've completed over the past decade. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest. Over the past few quarters, we've also been updating you on our goal to identify a life extension option for the Presque Isle Power Plant in Marquette, Michigan, an option that would be economically beneficial for our customers. In late November, we signed a definitive agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative that calls for Wolverine to acquire a minority interest in the plan by funding new state-of-the-art emission controls for the facility. The new controls are necessary to meet expected changes in air quality rules, while maintaining system reliability in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The joint venture, I should point out, will not reduce our rate base. We expect that it will reduce our operating costs. We plan to file for approvals from the Michigan and Wisconsin Commission in February, and hopefully, begin construction work in 2014. And as you'll also recall, we announced plans late last summer to convert the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley Plant is a co-generation facility located along the Menomonee River in Milwaukee that generates electricity for the grid and produces steam to heat hundreds of downtown Milwaukee buildings. Our analysis shows that converting the fuel source for this plant will reduce our operating cost and enhance the environmental performance of the Valley units. We plan to file an application with the Wisconsin Commission in the second quarter of this year for approval to modify the plant to use natural gas in the future. The electric capacity of the plant is expected to remain at 280 megawatts. If approved, we'll target completion of the project by late 2015 or early 2016. The current cost estimate, $60 million to $65 million. In addition, we're upgrading the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. The Wisconsin Commission approved this $26 million investment last June, and we expect to begin construction of the modern pipeline in the first quarter of this year. We believe the plan we put in place will secure Valley's role in meeting the energy needs of a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. On another important topic, we're continuing to investigate the need for additional capacity for our natural gas distribution network in the Western part of Wisconsin. Now, for you cheesehead aficionados, we're evaluating routes to serve the communities between the town of Wilson in Eau Claire County and the City of Tomah in Monroe County. This region will need additional capacity to address reliability and to meet growing demand for natural gas. We plan to seek approval from the Wisconsin Commission on this project this spring. Our projected investment in the initial phase of the gas distribution project for West Central Wisconsin is approximately $150 million. So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, we enter 2013 in excellent condition, financially and operationally. The company is performing at a high level. All of our Power the Future investments are providing tangible benefits for our customers and stockholders, and we have much more to do to renew and upgrade our distribution network as we focus on delivering the future. Now, with more details on our full year performance for 2012, and importantly, our outlook for 2013, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2012, our earnings from continuing operations rose to $2.35 a share. This compared with $2.18 a share for 2011. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2012 was right at $1 billion and is compared to $887 million in 2011. That's an increase of $113 million. The largest increase was in our utility segment. But we also saw an increase in our nonutility segment, which consists primarily of our Power the Future units. As we look at our utility operating income in 2012 as compared to 2011, you will see that operating income totaled $648 million for 2012, an increase of $103 million from 2011. As we discussed in our quarterly calls, the biggest driver in utility operating income was the impact of a 2011 rate agreement with our Wisconsin regulators. As background, going into 2012, we knew we needed a return on $1.3 billion of new plant that was being place into service with the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the air quality control system at our older Oak Creek units. Our agreement with the Wisconsin Commission froze base electric rates for customers in 2012, and it allowed us to recover depreciation expense and earn a return on the $1.3 billion of investment by suspending $148 million of regulatory amortizations that were part of our O&M expense. Our 2012 utility operating income, therefore, was favorably impacted by this $148 million amortization holiday. In addition, we estimate that the hot 2012 weather boosted our electric margins by approximately $19 million. Other factors, including lower fuel expense and lower O&M expense in our gas distribution business, accounted for the other $9 million of improvement. Partially offsetting these items was higher depreciation expense of $39 million, which primarily related to the $1.3 billion of new investments we discussed earlier. We also saw $34 million of lower gas margins primarily because of unseasonally warm winter weather in the first quarter of 2012. Now, turning to the non-utility energy segment, we saw operating income increase by $10 million in 2012 as compared to the prior year. As we mentioned during previous calls, we finalized the depreciable lives of the Oak Creek expansion units in 2012, which had a slight positive impact on earnings. We also had a full-year of earnings at the second Oak Creek expansion unit in 2012, which contributed to the increase in operating income. Taking the changes for these 2 segments together, we arrived at the $113 million increase in operating income for 2012. Corporate expenses and other miscellaneous items were flat year-over-year growth. During 2012, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company pooled nearly $66 million, up almost $3 million from 2011. Other income decreased by $28 million primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC allows us to accrue a return on approved utility projects during construction. In 2012, our AFUDC was down by almost $24 million because, as expected, we stopped accruing a return for the Oak Creek air quality control system and Glacier Hills when those facilities were placed into service. Net interest expense increased by $12 million primarily because of lower capitalized interest. We, of course, stopped capitalizing interest when the 2 large construction projects were placed into service. Consolidated income tax expense rose by approximately $43 million because of higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. The higher effective tax rate was driven primarily by lower equity AFUDC, which is a permanent difference for income tax purposes. Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 35.9% compared to 34% in 2011. We estimate that our effective tax rate in 2013 will be 37% to 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $546 million of net income for continuing operations for the full year 2012 or earnings of $2.35 per share. During 2012, we generated $1.2 billion of cash from operations on an adjusted basis, which includes changes in restricted cash. This is up over $261 million over 2011. Our cash from operations was helped by $20 million of higher net income, $35 million of higher depreciation expense, $184 million of lower net working capital and lower contributions to our pension and other benefit trust. In 2012, we contributed $100 million to our pension and other benefit trust compared to $277 million in 2011. Partially offsetting all these items was $148 million reduction in noncash amortizations compared to 2011. This change was driven by the terms of the 1-year rate increase. Our capital expenditures totaled $707 million in 2012, $124 million decrease as compared to 2011. We saw lower capital expenditures as our large construction projects were completed. We also paid $276 million in common dividends in 2012, which was $34 million greater than 2011. Dividends for the year equated to an annual rate of $1.20 per share, which was a 15% increase over the prior year's annual dividend of $1.04 per share. And, as Gale mentioned, the board, just 2 weeks ago, declared an increase in the quarterly dividend equivalent to $1.36 per share on an annual basis or a 13.3% increase for 2013. As of the end of 2012, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 53.2%. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We expect 2013 ratios to be in line with 2012. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Turning now to our sales results. As shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales of electricity decreased by 0.6% during 2012 as compared to the full year 2011. Our weather normalized sales were down by 1.5%. In our plan for 2012, we took into account an extended outage at our largest customer, and we knew that 2 other customers were moving to self-generation. Adjusting for these items, normalized retail sales declined by 0.2% for 2012 as compared to 2011. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw actual residential sales increase by 0.5% in 2012. On a normalized basis, residential sales declined by 1%. However, we believe the extreme weather conditions in 2012, including the warmest winter on record, and a hot dry summer compared to 2011, did impact the accuracy of our normalized results. Across our small commercial and industrial group, actual yearly sales rose by 0.7%. On a weather normalized basis, full-year sales to this group were up 0.3%. We continue to see modest growth in our small commercial and industrial class. Large commercial and industrial segment sales for the full year 2012 were down 2.8%. However, if you exclude the iron ore mines and the 2 self-generation customers, sales increased by 1.1%. Overall in 2013, we are projecting a decrease in weather-normalized sales of 0.7%, but that number does not tell the whole story. If we exclude the forecasted sales to the mines, we're projecting a slight increase of 0.2% for the year. We expect residential sales to remain relatively flat, impacted by modest growth in housing starts, offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting a slight increase of 0.3%. In the large commercial and industrial group, we are projecting a decrease of 2.4%. When you exclude the mines, we're projecting a slight increase in the large commercial and industrial group of 0.2%. Turning now to other items of interest. In December of 2012, our electric subsidiary issued a $250 million, 30-year bond at a coupon of 3.65%. This is the lowest 30-year coupon in our debt portfolio and one of the lowest on record. On a separate topic, as you know, the recent budget agreement in Washington extended bonus depreciation through 2013. Taken in isolation, you would expect to see a nearly $100 million reduction in rate base in 2015, which will carry through to 2016 as a result of this extension. However, as our new 5-year capital spending plan evolved, we saw the need to invest approximately $100 million more than our earlier internal projections. We took this impact into account when we finalized our capital budget of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period of 2013 to 2017. Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance. We expect our earnings for 2013 to be in the range of $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. Our 2013 earnings projection assumes normal weather and reflects the new rates authorized by the Wisconsin Commission. Again, our guidance for 2013 is $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. Now, before I talk specifically about our first quarter earnings guidance, I would like to touch on the accounting impact of the renewable tax grant associated with our new biomass plant. As Gale previously mentioned, our rates that went into effect January 1, 2013, reflect a bill credit for the expected benefit of the renewable grant. However, the accounting rules will not allow us to record the grant income until the plant is placed into service, which is expected in the fourth quarter this year. As a result, our revenues will be lower each quarter of 2013 until the plant is completed. When the plant is completed, we expect to record the grant income equal to the amount of the bill credits that were granted to date. We therefore expect this grant accounting treatment to reduce earnings in the first 3 quarters with a catch-up in the fourth quarter when the plant is scheduled to go online. Once the plan is commercial, you're allowed to match the grant income with the bill credits through December of 2014. With that as a backdrop, we expect our first quarter 2013 earnings to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The timing of this renewable grant is expected to reduce the first quarter earnings by approximately $0.03 per share. In addition, relative to 2012, our first quarter earnings are expected to be lower by approximately $0.04 per share due to lower AFUDC. With that, I will turn things to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.", "James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A question for you, actually 2 questions. One is a minutia question and one's a big picture. First, on the minutia. Did you say you expect to complete the buyback program this year? And then the second is really the big picture one. And so in light of the board's second approved dividend policy in less than a year, I mean a major revision, the question is how do you think about the balance between earnings growth and dividend growth over the longer term? So I guess said differently, how do you view your value proposition and differentiate yourself prospectively?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay, very good questions, Jim. On the minutia question, the answer is no, I did not say we would complete the buyback program in 2013. I did say the board had authorized the program to run through 2013. But as you know, we're being opportunistic.", "There is no definite timeframe where the board has said we must finish the program for 2013. We will take a look each opportunity we have and go from there. And on the larger question, actually, I think there are 3 pieces to the answer. And the first piece, basically, I heard you asked how do we expect to differentiate ourselves as a quality investment going forward. And I really think it starts with the fact that we have today, we're in a fortunate position that we have greater financial flexibility today than certainly any time in the recent history of this company. And I think we have greater financial flexibility than virtually any other company in the industry. You'll see when we release our new investor deck tomorrow that we're projecting to have over $500 million of free cash flow in the period through 2017. We have, I think, so, number one, terrific financial flexibility. The second piece is even post Power the Future, we have significant growth. The growth is different, as I pointed out in the script, but we have significant growth that is needed in terms of the upgrade and the renewal of our distribution networks. So we're projecting 4% to 6% annual earnings-per-share growth, and given the financial flexibility we have, we think we have best-in-class dividend growth story. So when you put that altogether, I can see us delivering and believe we can deliver 8% to 10% total shareholder returns. And when your risk-adjust that for the type of projects that we have in front of us and the demonstrated ability of the management to deliver projects on time and on budget, I personally think that, that equates to a superior return story.", "James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Can I just follow up with one question or two?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure.", "James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "On the dividend policy, when the board talks about dividend policy and upping the payout ratio, how do you balance what that rate payout policy is supposed to be? So if we're entering an environment where utility growth is slower prospectively because in a 5% to 6% rate base growth environment, and underlying demand of 0% to 1%, it's going to be pretty tough to match that going forward. How do you think about modulating between dividends and the other considerations?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I think essentially -- again, a very good question, Jim. Essentially, what we do, and I think many do this, we step back and say what is legitimate capital spending need this business has. And we've identified that, for example, going forward in our new 5-year plan at $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion, okay? So how do we finance the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion? In our case, that can be done with internally generated cash and also keeping our debt to total capital where it needs to be. So then, once you've identified that, what does your dividend policy evolve to from that situation, because in our case, we don't believe we need to issue additional equity. So in essence, we piece the puzzle together, starting with what is our growth opportunity, what is the investment need in the business, how do we finance that and then what can we do to stay at the efficient frontier for a company like ours on dividend policy.", "James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then I have one last one and I'll let it -- turn it over. But on going back to my final minutia question, your earnings guidance for 2013, does that assume some level of buyback for the balance of the year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "It does assume some level of buyback for the balance of the year, that is correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So can you give us an update on where the debate in the Statehouse stands on the government potentially deciding to divest its state-owned power plants given their inability to find the funds to upgrade the emissions controls, and whether or not you might be in a position to help the government meet its emission controls and generation needs?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, we're not from the government, but we are here to help you, Greg. The truth of the matter is I think we will know a great deal more by July. The legislature now in Wisconsin is just back into session and the governor will be presenting his new biannual budget to the legislature sometime in the next few weeks. So there are a couple of different opportunities if a bill to authorize the sale of state power plants and other state assets, if that -- a bill like that is to move forward, there are a number of opportunities certainly in the first half of this year. So I believe we'll have much a clearer view of whether a sale of the state-owned  power plants is imminent by the time the budget passes in July.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "But the capital budget that you just laid out for us, since it's not at this point clear that there'll be an opportunity for you there, that would be accretive to that budget if that came about?", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are correct, that would be accretive to that budget.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "You mentioned sales growth in your '13 guidance, and I was just curious if you could just comment on O&M expense trends?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure, I'd be happy to. Now, one of the things that you will see and that may confuse some folks, as you look at our O&M reports over the next 4 quarters, just remember, we had an amortization holiday under our previous rate order that, in essence, put up on our balance sheet or kept on our balance sheet a $148 million of regulatory assets that did not amortize through O&M in 2012. That stopped as of January 1 of this year. So you're going to see $148 million increase in essence in O&M over the course of 2013 compared to 2012, but that's because of the regulatory amortization holiday ending. Essentially, there will be a very modest other increase in normal O&M. There'll be some increase related to some of the capital projects that we have on the distribution side of the business, are 80%  capital, 20% O&M under the rate formulas. So you may see some very modest increase in overall O&M, but day-to-day O&M other than that associated with supporting capital projects will be flat.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then also, I think in the previous calls, you mentioned some gas infrastructure growth in some of the regions where there's attractive sand for frac-ing.", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is correct.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Is that associated with the gas distribution investment of over $100 million you referenced earlier?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes. The $150 million project that we said, roughly $150 million capital project for western Wisconsin that I mentioned earlier in the call is directly associated with a major project for that part of the state. And it's related to 2 things. One, yes, we're seeing substantial increase in frac sand mining, but we also have customer growth there as customers convert from propane. So our projections are showing a dwindling amount of reserve capacity in the western part of the state. So we think there's a very solid and important case to make to the Public Service Commission for construction authority for that project, and we'll be making that case this year.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And lastly, on the potential state divestitures, can you remind us? I know there are small -- there are several small units. I'm just curious if -- I'd like to kind of gauge what type of investment size this could potentially lead to.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, we'd be happy to do that. First of all, there are -- and we're not certain if the state would put all of these plants up for bid or just some of them. All of that is yet to be determined. But if all of them were put up for sale, there are 37 of them, 3 or 4 are reasonable size. 3 or 4 are actually power plants that produce electricity for the grid and steam for a particular type of state customer. The remainder other than those 3 or 4, which are of reasonable size, the remainder are smaller steam plants that produce steam heat for specific state facilities. For example, the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee has a relatively new steam heat plant. It doesn't produce electricity for the grid but does produce district heat for a particular part of that campus. In terms of investment opportunity, we have a placeholder. We have not been allowed, no one has been because this hasn't been finally decided by the state. No one has been able to really do any due diligence on a particular project for these 37 different facilities. There's a state --as just a placeholder, we're thinking $200 million to $250 million.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just reasonable size, what is that, 25 to 50 megawatts per unit?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Some of them are even smaller.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "You guys went through, and I apologize for being slow on the projected sales growth, I think for 2013, with or without the mines and stuff, could you -- I apologize. Could you redo those for me?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We will be happy to ask Pat to redo those for you.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Sure, I'll be glad to. So we projected overall, a decrease in weather normalized sales of 0.7%. However, if you exclude the mines, it's really an increase of 0.2%.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And this is retail, right?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes. And then if you flip quickly through the segments. Residential is basically flat. Small C&I, a slight increase of 0.3% and then large C&I, we projected a decrease of 2.4%. But if you exclude the mines, again, the large C&I is actually going to be an increase of 0.2%.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Other way to look at that is weather normalized, basically, we're expecting to hit the earnings targets we've given you with essentially no sales growth. 0.2%, weather-normalized, excluding the mines.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Does this take into account leap year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Leap year, yes.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes, it does. Oh, yes.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So leap year, obviously -- okay. So that basically is -- that's been normalized for that, correct?", "Gale E. Klappa", "It's been normalized for leap year. Were you in our forecast meeting?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "No, I'm afraid not. I hope you benefited from my absence. But I guess I wanted to get your thoughts. I mean 2/10 of -- this is not exactly blockbuster growth. Just your thoughts about going forward, just policies for energy efficiency, renewables, what have you. I mean just sort of trying to get a sense as to how -- is there -- what do you think longer-term here or things that are driving this and how, as you guys are obviously very forward thinking, what have you, how do you position yourselves in terms of dealing with what appears to be, let's face it, not exactly superb growth? I mean, is that just an abnormality for this year or how do you look going forward longer-term?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, very good question. And I think, as you know, this is a question that is really beginning to be asked all over the industry. The first thing I would say is lots of companies will give you earnings growth projections and then when you dig deeper and say, well, what's behind that in terms of sales growth, 1%, 2% or 3%, we have never based our earnings growth projections on what we think are anything but appropriately conservative and rational sales ACs, but input from our customers. So let me take it segment by segment because I think there's a different story to answer your question in each one of the 3 segments.", "First, the large industrial, strictly tied to the economy. We -- if you normalize our 2012 numbers, I think we were up 1.1% in industrial, nothing to write home about but -- I mean just intuitively to me, given what we're seeing in the economy in Wisconsin, that felt about right.", "Commercial, we are up weather-normalized. It seems to me like we're seeing modest but continuing, predictable growth in the commercial segment of our customer group. The real puzzling one is residential. And there, I have a theory and I could be wrong. But it does not make a lot of sense to me when I see our weather-normalized residential sales. And I was talking with Scott Lauber the other day and he was saying, we had to weather-normalize 4% of our sales, closer to 5% of our sales, just because of the abnormal weather in 2011 and 2012. That's a huge number of megawatt hours. And we were 4, 5 standard -- well, 3 or 4 standard deviations away from norm in terms of the weather over the last couple of years. So my view is that we really need another year to update on residential before we really understand what's happening in terms of residential customer demand. I just am not seeing, and I don't think any of us are seeing, a major change in lifestyle in terms of our residential customers. We are seeing a change in the appliances and tools that are available to our customers to live their lifestyles. They're getting more efficient support from appliances, from TVs and everything else. But I still think our residential growth is underlying stronger than the numbers are showing because at this kind of deviation from norm, the weather normalization techniques just are not that accurate. So we really -- we're cautious. We're not going to promise you sales growth that we can't deliver. And I think the key going forward, if we don't see a rebound in growth, particularly in residential, the key going forward is going to be cost discipline. We have to continue to drive cost and productivity in our business. I hope that helps, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "It does. But then, I guess it's too early for any rate design or any thoughts about sort of a different construct with regulators or what have you, or it's just too early to say? Is that how we should think about it?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, actually, I mean we have a construct with our regulators in Wisconsin that I think is quite beneficial to everyone, and that is the commission has asked each of the Wisconsin utilities to file a case every 2 years with a 2-year forward-looking test period. So to me, the 2-year forward-looking test period, taking into account reasonable assumptions of sales demand -- sales and demand growth really is among the best protection you can get anywhere.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I got you. So decoupling, it doesn't -- I mean, since you're coming in so frequently and since you have the forward-look, it sort of negates the potential need for decoupling or something like that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That would certainly be my view.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to make sure, first of all, capital spending. Do you see -- if I remember correctly, '13 was higher outlook than '14. Do you still see that or do you see capital spending more kind of like levelized if I just took $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion and divide it by the 5 years? That's the first question. The second is free cash flow. Can you repeat the comment you made about how much total free cash flow after dividends you expect over the next few years?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, first of all, and you will see this on our investor deck that we're going to release tomorrow, the new breakdown of the 5-year capital spend, I will give you 5 numbers. For 2013, we're estimating $656 million of capital; for 2014, $589 million; and for 2015, $741 million.", "James Patrick Keyes", "And that's at the utility, Michael.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, that's at the utility, exactly. That's coming off of by comparison $697 million of the utility for 2012. And we have that further broken down of the slide in the investor deck, the generation, electric delivery, gas delivery, renewables, et cetera. So you'll see a pretty granular breakdown tomorrow. But those are the essential numbers going forward. And then your other question about cash flow. What we're showing in our projections is a little better than $500 million of free cash for the 5-year period 2013 through 2017 after capital spending and after our dividend policy that we've announced is implemented.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And does that include or exclude the buyback program you've authorized?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, that would include.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. So it's not incremental for the buyback? It is...", "James Patrick Keyes", "Michael, this is Pat. Let me clarify. The $500 million over the 5 years is before we start the buyback. So in other words, we would use the $500 million as cash to help fund the buyback.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Exactly, yes.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay. It just strikes me as given some of the stuff you put out in the public domain regarding various tax-related items, that your free cash flow would actually even be a little bit above that level. Am I -- I may be overstating something, but it just -- the $500 million at first glance over the next 5 years strikes me as a little bit on the shy side. Not that, that's a problem. Most other companies don't have that problem.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Michael, we appreciate it. I guess the only thing I could say is you know how that cash was generated, certainly from operations, also from bonus depreciation. That bonus depreciation kind of falls off over time. If you're running like next year's model and you're saying, boy, you're sure generating a lot of that cash next year, that wouldn't surprise me if that's what your model said. Certainly, we expect more of the cash flow over the 5 years to be in the upfront years than in the back-end.", "Gale E. Klappa", "It's more front-end loaded.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And are there things, whether it's working capital, whether it's pension contributions or something else, that are significant cash outflows that may not show up -- that aren't necessarily net income D&A, CapEx, dividends, kind of the big 4?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No. In fact -- the short answer is no. But we've had very good control of our working capital over the course of the last several years. In addition to that, from a pension fund standpoint, we're almost 100% funded, which many companies cannot say. So we don't see anything else like that lurking that would show a deviation in the numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with MorningStar.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just provide a little clarity on the timing for decision regarding air permit application for the western, eastern coal blend in Oak Creek? And then clarify question, you said you were 100% funded for the pension funds?", "Gale E. Klappa", "99-point-something.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes, we're over 99, Andy.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And we'll ask Allen Leverett to comment on the timing for the air permit for the fuel blending at Oak Creek.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes, we expect to have that resolved in the first quarter of the year. So I certainly see it as being in the first part of this year. But we'll have to work with not only the U.S. EPA, but we're also working with the Wisconsin DNR. So we have to work with both agencies, get their concurrence and then the DNR is the one that will actually issue the permit. So we hope to have all of that wrapped up in the first quarter so that we can begin the testing, say, in the second quarter of this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just your O&M commentary, so we should take 12, add 148 for the holiday and then gross that up by 1% or 2%? Is that fair?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I would -- actually, I don't think I'd even add 1% to 2%. I'd keep it flat.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And can you just review the language around the grant and how that's impacting timing?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We sure can. I'll frame it and will let Pat fill in the detail. Essentially, in the Wisconsin Commission rate order, for rates that went into effect here in January of '13, we agreed -- in fact we proposed and the commission agreed that we would prefund, if you will, the grant. So customers are receiving, starting with their January bills, a portion of the federal tax grant that we expect to receive upon completion of the biomass plant. So in essence, because we're giving customer credits in advance of receiving the cash, our revenues are going to go down and they will have a slight impact each quarter for the first 3 quarters on earnings. And then we do a big catch-up according to the accounting rules in Q4. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Exactly, Gale. So I would look at it this way. If first quarter was a $0.03, you can expect to see something similar, same zip code, second quarter and third quarter, and then a $0.09 pickup in Q4 so it all comes clean.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Is there a cost of money issue?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Oh, a minor one, yes. But, I mean, it's factored into the rate case.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins", "I was wondering, you mentioned -- update us a little bit on the CapEx program and apparently, there'll be more details tomorrow.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Correct.", "Dan Jenkins", "Do you have -- could you give us an update for what you're planning for financing needs in 2013?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure. Pat and Scott have that right in front of them.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes, glad to, Dan. We have got debt retiring, I believe it's in May at Wisconsin Electric of about $300 million. So you can expect us to be out for a bond over roughly that amount, roughly Q2, Q3. And then at Wisconsin Gas, we have got $45 million of debt retiring in Q4. I would expect we'll be doing a new issue of Q3, Q4 at Wisconsin Gas in the $100 million, $150 million neighborhood.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. Then I was also wondering, I'm trying to get a better idea of what's going on in the large commercial, industrial. You had fairly large decline mostly related to the mines and those 2 self-generation customers in 2012.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Correct.", "Dan Jenkins", "But then you mentioned in the release that the mine return to normal operation in September, but yet you expect a big decline again in 2013, mostly related to the mine. So, I guess, is the mine just becoming a lot smaller and smaller operation or what's going on?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, I don't think the mine is becoming a much smaller and smaller operation, but they are -- they're very good about informing us of their plan in terms of when they see demand and how they expect to run their mine operations throughout the course of the year. And clearly, what we did when we put together our industrial forecast for 2014 was take the input from the mines on when they might, in essence, have a slowdown in their operations in 2013. So what you're seeing is basically the mines having more variable operation than perhaps the past couple of years.", "Dan Jenkins", "Right. It sounds like -- so how much of the 2.8% decline in '12 was related to the mine? Do you know that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Looking at Scott. I would say the lion's share of it -- now, we did have 2 customers, but they were smaller in 2012 go to self-generation. But the lion's share of it, Scott, would be the mines.", "Scott J. Lauber", "Right. If you exclude the mines, they're relatively flat.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, exactly. Just exclude the mines, relatively flat.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. So they're going to be even lower than they were though in '12 again? And so that's what I would...", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, no. I don't believe so.", "Scott J. Lauber", "Just a little bit lower in '12. They announced that they're going to idle the plant in the second and third quarter a little bit.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, they're bringing their operations down some of the second and third quarters.", "Scott J. Lauber", "Extended summer outage.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then you mentioned that you're nearly fully funded on the pension. Will you need to make any more contributions in 2013 or will that...", "Gale E. Klappa", "None planned in 2013.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then if you could just expand a little bit on the fairly sizable benefit of '12 over '11 and the working capital. Is a lot of that related to the deferral?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Actually, no. The deferral -- it would not relate to deferral. Steve Dickson has the details in front of him. Steve?", "Stephen P. Dickson", "Yes, and I assume you're referring to the earnings package, and I'm looking at Page 11 and we've separately broken out the regulatory amortization. So you can see the $148 million change year-to-year. In the working capital and other, it declined. It was a negative $230 million last year, this year, it's a negative $56 million. So actually, that's a favorable improvement of about $174 million. The biggest item in there relates to income taxes that we got back, and it relates to the bonus depreciation that we talked and we were able to generate a net operating loss carry back. So we went back to where we've paid taxes in prior years. So there's $128 million and then the difference was $20 million in inventory, working capital. Gas prices are lower so we benefited from that. Does that make sense?", "Dan Jenkins", "Yes, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And this may be one for Mr. Leverett. Just curious. You've given out for ATC, a 10-year capital spending projection. I think it was like $3.9 billion and above roughly. Can you just talk about the scope and scale, meaning is that very front-end loaded, is that very back-end loaded? I think if I remember correctly, ATC's CapEx had been around in the $250 million range or so for the last few years. Where is that heading in the next couple of years?", "Allen L. Leverett", "It's somewhat back-end loaded, Michael. And we sound like a broken record talking about this package that's coming out tomorrow, but in the package that comes out tomorrow, you'll see kind of a 3-year path for the capital spending at ATC. So in 2013, we expect the spending to be roughly $291 million and then $255 million in '14 and then it jumps. It's projected to jump to $362 million in 2015. So it's somewhat back-end loaded, and in fact, some of the really large projects that are in their forecast during the -- are out, say, in year 7, 8, 9 because those are projects that are associated with transmission fixes for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. So those are pretty far out in the forecast. So in general, pretty back-end loaded, and the package tomorrow will show you the year-by-year detail, at least for the next 3 years at ATC.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, Allen. And just refresh, how does that compare to 2012 CapEx at ATC?", "Allen L. Leverett", "I want to say that the 2012 CapEx -- I thought it was around the $250 million number that you mentioned, actually, Michael, but let me get, Pat, maybe if you could check that number.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Well, it was $310 million. So a little over $300 million.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And your owner -- and am I right, your ownership percentage, mid-20 like 26%, 28%?", "James Patrick Keyes", "26.2%.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And the same ROE and authorized equity layer metrics, no changes there?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Nothing has changed in their tariff. So it's still 12 to ROE, roughly 50% equity deemed capital structure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just on the mining customers, is that a material earnings impact? I mean, isn't a lot of their -- a lot of that demand charges or how does that work?", "Gale E. Klappa", "They are on an interruptible rate by and large because it's not a very significant movement in terms of just looking at, say, 2013 versus 2012. No significant difference in earnings impact.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Who are the big customers?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Who are the -- theirs or -- who are the mines?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Gale E. Klappa", "They are owned by Cleveland-Cliffs.", "Allen L. Leverett", "So they're 2 major mines, Paul. There's the Empire Mine and the Tilden Mine. And the one that's been doing the extended shutdowns, I believe, is the Empire Mine.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Empire and what was the other one?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Tilden.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Tilden. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office and her direct line, (414) 221-2592. Thanks again.

After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Colleen, thank you. On this beautiful spring day, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us as we review the company's 2013 first quarter results. I'll begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of WE Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dixon, Controller; and Scott Lauber, Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.76 a share for the first quarter of 2013. This compares with earnings of $0.74 a share for the first quarter last year. The results were stronger than last year, primarily because of favorable weather, the positive impact of our share repurchases and slightly higher earnings at WE Power. You may recall that we experienced the warmest winter in 122 years last year. By contrast, this winter was colder than normal. And March was a particularly strong month. We actually delivered 71% more natural gas to our customers in March of this year than March a year ago. Our earnings also rose by $0.01 a share at WE Power in light of the final approval during our last Wisconsin rate case of the investment in our new Oak Creek units. In addition, the impact of our share repurchase program added $0.01 a share to our earnings for the quarter. We also continued to achieve milestones in the operational areas. In fact, J.D. Power & Associates has ranked our company the #1 large utility in the midwest for customer satisfaction among business customers.", "Turning now to the economy in our region. Wisconsin's unemployment rate climbed to 7.1% in March. That's up from 6.7% in December, but still well below the national average. Given that the economy was just treading water during the winter months, it's not surprising that Energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers declined by about 3.9% compared to the first quarter a year ago. The main drivers of this reduction were lower Energy sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines in Michigan's upper Peninsula and the impact of leap year in 2012, obviously not recurring in 2013. Factoring out the impact of the mines, leap year and weather, sales to our large commercial and industrial customers declined just slightly by 0.5%. Overall, sales to our large customers were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. We did however, see growth in several sectors particularly printing and publishing and the production of plastics. An uptick in new customer connections also continued in the first quarter. New electric service installations were up 5% compared to the first quarter of 2012 and connections of new natural gas customers rose by 3.9%, again, compared to the same period last year.", "Now, as many of you know, we have 1 major construction project underway. Our biomass fueled power plant and Rothchild, Wisconsin. Construction is now nearly 80% complete and we're on schedule for commercial operation by the end of 2013. Erection of the main boiler was finished earlier this year. The switch yard has now been energized and connected to the distribution system. And piping and electrical installation continue throughout the project. We successfully completed a hydro test of the boiler in February, ensuring that all boiler pipes are welded properly and can function under the required operating pressures. We began conducting steam blows earlier this month, pushing steam through the pipes to clear dirt and debris that accumulate during construction. Work on the fuel handling system, which includes the truck dumper and the conveyor network, continues, and we expect the fuel handling system to be completed, powered and ready for testing during the second quarter of this year. And then just 2 days from now, we'll be hosting our annual stockholders meeting in Rothchild. We're offering our shareholders an opportunity to tour the construction site and see the progress firsthand.", "Now, as I've noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. We'll be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the operating paper mill will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total some $255 million and that's excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Turning now to Wisconsin Regulatory matters. As you may recall, the rate request we filed in 2012 with the Wisconsin Commission for electric, natural gas and steam rates covered our revenue requirements for the years 2013 and 2014. The commission completed its review, and issued a final order last December for rates that went into effect on January 1. Our request, of course, was driven primarily by the investment of approximately $1.6 billion in previously approved capital projects, including the air-quality controls at our older Oak Creek units, the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the Rothchild biomass plant. Switching gears now, you'll recall that in 2011, our board authorized this buyback up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock. That authorization runs through the end of 2013. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 279,000 shares at a cost of $11.1 million. Since the program began, we repurchased approximately $4,930,000 shares at a cost of just under $163 million. That equates to an average purchase price of $33.03 a share. And as we previously announced, our board has adopted a dividend policy that targets a 60% payout ratio in 2014 trending to a 65% to 70% ratio in 2017. This policy should support double-digit dividend growth next year and 7% to 8% increases from 2015 to 2017 as we move toward a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. Of course, in January the board raised the quarterly dividend to $0.34 a share, an increase of 13.3%. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.36 a share.", "Now, I'd like to turn to another topic and discuss the investment opportunities that we see in our core business as we focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2013 through 2017. And with this 5-year budget, the nature of our capital investments are shifting away from high-profile projects such as our Power The Future units, renewable generation and larger quality controls. Instead, our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. Over the next 5 years, we will focus on the building blocks, if you will, of our delivery business: Pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations. Starting this year and continuing through 2017, we plan to rebuild 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines that are, today, more than 50 years old. We also intend to replace 18,500 power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally hundreds of substation components. On the natural gas side of our business, we plan to replace 1,250 miles of gas mains, as well as 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and approximately 233,000-meter sets. The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects that we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest. We'll of course keep you up-to-date as these needed infrastructure upgrades move forward.", "And along those lines, we have identified the need for additional capacity on our natural gas distribution system in the western part of Wisconsin to address reliability and to meet growing demand. This demand is driven in part by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in that region. We've evaluated routes and submitted our application to the Wisconsin Commission on March 28. We're asking for authority to build a natural gas lateral that would stretch for approximately 85 miles from Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in Monroe County, in West Central Wisconsin. If approved, construction could start in early 2015 with a projected in-service date during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our projected investment in the initial phase of this project is expected to range between $150 million and $170 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Moving now from distribution to generation, as you recall, we signed a definitive agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative in late November of last year that calls for Wolverine to acquire a minority interest in the Presque Power Plant in Marquette Michigan by funding new state-of-the-art emission controls for the facility. The new controls are necessary to meet expected changes in air-quality rules while maintaining system reliability in Michigan's upper Peninsula. We began seeking regulatory approval of the joint venture in February of this year. We've already received orders from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Michigan Public Service Commission and proceedings in Wisconsin are moving along well. We're targeting receipt of all necessary approvals by early fourth quarter of this year and we hope to begin construction in 2014. As a reminder, the joint venture will not reduce our rate base, but we expect that it will reduce our operating costs.", "And you'll remember that we also announced plans to convert the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. As a reminder, the Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located on the Menomonee River here in Milwaukee that generates electricity for the grid, provides voltage support for the grid, and produces reliable steam to heat more than 450 downtown Milwaukee buildings. Our analysis shows that converting the fuel source for the plant will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. The electric capacity of the plant is expected to remain at 280 megawatts. We filed an application with the Wisconsin Commission just last week on April 26. If approved, our target for completing the conversion at Valley will be late 2015 or early 2016. The current cost estimate? $65 million to $70 million. Now, this project will follow the $26 million upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. We believe the plan we put in place will secure Valley's role in meeting the energy needs of a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.", "Turning now to our Oak Creek expansion units, we continue to make progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the plant. We received a revised air permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources that will allow us to make changes at the Oak Creek expansion units. Changes that are necessary for the blending of Eastern bituminous and Western sub-bituminous coal. The units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous and sub-bituminous coal, our customers could see annual fuel savings of $25 million to $50 million depending on the amount of sub-bituminous coal that could be used in blending. We expect to begin testing now in May and to continue our testing into 2014. We would then apply for authority from the Wisconsin Commission to invest in the plant upgrades that would be needed.", "Another possible investment opportunity that we continue to follow is the potential sale of the electric and steam generating plants that are owned by the state of Wisconsin. The governor has proposed a new 2-year state budget that includes a provision to expand the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties including these plants. We expect the Wisconsin Legislature to complete its action on the state budget by mid-summer.", "Finally, I'd like to give you an update in our plan to build a new powerhouse at the Twin Falls hydroelectric site. Twin Falls is located on the border of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Twin Falls is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. It was built back in 1912. And while the plant is licensed to operate until 2040, the existing powerhouse is badly in need of repair. We considered several alternatives, but the most prudent course is to build a new powerhouse. The project also calls for adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We filed an application with the Wisconsin Commission for a certificate of authority for the project, as well as a license amendment application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We have also been securing other necessary permits and licenses along the way. Assuming the project is approved, we expect to begin construction in the fall of 2013 with completion in 2016. We estimate the cost of the project to be between $60 million and $65 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Now, before wrapping our update up, I have a quick update for you on American Transmission Company. We're the second largest owner of ATC with an ownership stake of 26.2%. Of course, ATC is investing in its traditional service area, but the company is also reviewing transmission investments in other parts of the country. ATC is pursuing these investments through a joint venture with Duke Energy known as DATC. As many of you may already know, DATC recently acquired a 72% interest in California's Path 15 transmission line for an investment of $56 million. Path 15 is an 84-mile, 500 kv line in Central California. The Wisconsin Energy equity investment in this project is expected to be approximately $7.4 million.", "In conclusion, our company continues to perform at a high level and we're off to a strong start in 2013. And now, for the details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2013 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.76 a share compared with $0.74 a share for the same quarter in 2012. The results were better than last year primarily because of favorable weather, the positive impact of our share repurchases and increased earnings at WE Power. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $321 million as compared to $295.7 million in 2012, an increase of $25.3 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $230.6 million for 2013, an increase of $22 million over the first quarter of 2012. As Gale mentioned earlier, we experienced a colder than normal winter, which was a significant contrast from 2012 when we experienced record warmth. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we estimate that our electric and gas margins improved by $50.4 million because of the weather. This year, we estimate that we were helped by $16.2 million as compared to normal weather. And last year, we estimate that we were hurt by $34.2 million because of the abnormally warm weather.", "As we turn to the other factors impacting utility operating income, recall that we implemented new rates for our electric and gas customers in Wisconsin effective January 1 of this year. These new rates reflect our investments in environmental controls and renewable energy. These rates also reflect changes in our O&M costs, including the reinstatement of the amortization of certain regulatory assets. If you recall, last year, as part of our base rate freeze, we had a regulatory amortization holiday. With that as background, you will notice that our depreciation expense is up $7.9 million, primarily because of the investment in environmental controls. We also estimate that the impact of leap year in 2012, not repeating of course in 2013, reduced our electric and gas margins by $6.7 million. Our fuel recoveries are $5.1 million behind last year's first quarter and our O&M costs are $4.2 million higher this year. As I mentioned, last year we had an amortization holiday that reduced our annual O&M by $148 million or $37.5 million per quarter. This year, we reinstated the amortization. However, our bad debt expense was down by $17.2 million this quarter and we lengthened the lives of certain other amortizations, which reduced expenses by approximately $3 million. In addition, the business units reduced operating costs by approximately $13.1 million as compared to last year. Combining all of these items brings you to the $4.2 million increase in O&M costs. Our O&M cost will vary each quarter. However, as a reminder, we expect our annual O&M cost to be flat to 2% higher than 2012. Finally, we had an additional $4.5 million of other net costs, which when combined with the above items, resulted in a $22 million net increase in utility operating income.", "I would also like to mention 1 item briefly that is affecting our quarterly earnings. As you may recall, we expect to receive a federal tax grant when we complete our new biomass facility later this year. Our customers are currently receiving the benefits of this grant through bill credits. However, accounting rules do not allow us to recognize a grant income until the plant is placed into service. We estimate that our first quarter earnings would have been $0.03 [ph]  higher if we have recorded the grant income to match the bill credits.", "Now, turning to our non-utility segment, operating income in this segment was up $3.2 million this quarter because of the final approval of our Power The Future plant costs in the last Wisconsin rate case. We expect this increase to continue each quarter throughout 2013. Taking the changes for these 2 segments together, and a slight improvement a corporate and other, you arrive at the $25.3 million increase in operating income. Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.6 million in the first quarter, which is a $1 million improvement over the same period in 2012. Our other income net, declined by $11.6 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased as a result of the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units last year. In addition, our net interest expense increased by $6.1 million, primarily because of the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units. Once the construction was completed, we stopped capitalizing interests.", "Consolidated income tax expense rose by $4.1 million because of higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $176.6 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2013, or earnings of $0.76 per share.", "During the first quarter of 2013, we generated $330.3 million of cash from operations, a $10.2 million decrease from the first quarter of 2012. This decrease is a result of higher working capital requirements driven by higher accounts receivable and accrued revenue, given the colder weather, compared to last year. Partially offsetting this is higher net income and higher depreciation and amortization. Our total capital expenditures decreased by $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the opening quarter of 2012. We saw lower expenditures because construction is complete on the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units. This was partially offset by additional capital expenditures related to the biomass project. We also paid $77.8 million in common dividends in 2013, an increase of $8.7 million over 2012. Dividends for the year equate to an annual rate of $1.36 per share which is a 13.3% increase over the prior year's annual dividend of $1.20 per share. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.3% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. The projected year end debt-to-total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2012 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. And as shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales of electricity increased by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Our normalized first quarter sales were down by 0.6%. All normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of leap year and weather. Leap year alone caused the decline of approximately 1.1% in 2013 relative to 2012.", "Looking at the individual customer segments, with the return of colder weather, we saw actual residential sales up 5.2% and on a normalized basis, the sales were up 0.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, we actually saw -- we saw actual quarterly sales up 1.3%. On a normalized basis, sales of small, commercial and industrial customers were down 0.7%.  In the large commercial & industrial segment, on a normalized basis, sales for the first quarter of 2013 were down by 1.4%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales were down 0.5%. Overall, these results are in line with our expectations.", "Turning now to our earnings forecast. First, we're reaffirming our 2013 guidance of $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. While we were helped by the first quarter weather, we still have 9 more months of weather variability ahead of us.", "Before I turn things back to Gale, I would also like to provide guidance on our second quarter earnings. As background, we earned $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2012. However, the weather boosted our second quarter earnings last year by $0.03 per share. In addition, our 2012 earnings were frontloaded because of the allowance for funds used during construction that we booked on the air quality control project at older Oak Creek units. Also, as mentioned earlier, we cannot record the income from the federal tax grant for our biomass plant until the plant is placed into service. The customer bill credits will continue in the second quarter and this is expected to reduce our quarterly earnings by $0.03 per share. Taking these factors into consideration, and assuming normal weather, we estimate our 2013 second quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.46 per share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Real quick question. And by the way, congrats guys on a good quarter. Just curious in terms of how you're thinking -- and this may be an Allen question, how you're thinking about the capital expansion process? I know it's kind of in the budget for ATC, but in terms of the execution part of that, meaning getting permits, getting siting, getting it done on time, on trajectory?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That's definitely an Allen question.", "Allen L. Leverett", "I guess you'd have to take that in sort of in 2 parts, Michael. Within the state of Wisconsin, within [indiscernible] and within the upper Peninsula of Michigan, they certainly had a very, now long-standing, over a decade, process that's pretty well understood and they have a good process at ATC to go through that. And really, the only uncertainty there is when you bring a project forward, the primary uncertainty is the time frame that are going to be required to get regulatory approvals. But typically, for a CA, the way a CA works now, once your CA is deemed complete, it's no more than 360 days to get approval. There's a 180-day initial period and then the Commission can extend that for another 180 days. So I think within the footprints, that would be the primary question, just the length of time that it would take to get a regulatory approval. Outside the footprints, I mean we're still pretty early days, Michael, on doing projects outside the footprint. Gale mentioned the Path 15 investment, but that was an existing transmission line. So outside of the footprint, not a lot that I can say about that. But candidly, if you look at our forecast for this year, '14, '15, we're not assuming any projects outside the footprint in any case. Hopefully, that helps.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And Michael, I think Allen made an important point. If you look at the capital expenditures that we've broken down in our Investor Day that we talked about, the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period, Allen is correct. We do not include any outside the footprint investment in ATC in those numbers. So that would be investment upside.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And how about on the gas side? I mean, lots of what I'm asking about is very nuts and bolts stuff. But you've got a lot of gas distribution infrastructure investment in your plan over the next couple of years. Just curious whether siting -- how does siting and permitting process of that works in the state of Wisconsin? Do you have to go to local siding boards? Do you go straight to PSC and it serves as kind of centralized siding board, et cetera?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Both are good questions, Michael. The answer is really in 2 parts. For much of the gas distribution work that we've described, there really is not -- the individual projects did not rise to the level where we need to seek construction authority from the Wisconsin Commission. For example, we mentioned 83,000 individual gas lines. Those would be the lines that come off the street and hook directly to your home. Those projects are much smaller in nature and do not require a construction authority permitting from the Wisconsin commission. Certainly, the largest project that we have in front of us on the gas the distribution side that will require construction authority from the Wisconsin Commission is the one that we've mentioned and that's the Western Wisconsin Gas expansion. That is a very significant project, $150 million to $170 million in the initial phase. And so we've begun the process there of seeking approval. We filed our initial request in late March. Then we will have a -- Allen, a supplemental construction authority request in late summer.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes, there's some additional environmental information that we have to file in August.", "Operator", "Greg Gordon with ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "My question goes to what happened in the quarter vis-a-vis sales and what you're hearing from your customers for the balance of the year. Because clearly, you had a pullback in sales from industrial, but it was driven by natural resources. Obviously, we've had a big deflation in commodity prices because of what's going over in China and that had a big impact on your 1 particular customer. But in the manufacturing segment and other segments of the industrial mosaic and your service territory, can you give us some more color on what you're seeing there?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I'd be happy to, Greg. And let me back up. As you know, when we put our sales forecasts together for a new coming year, we interview our 120 largest industrial customers and get their direct feedback on their expectation in terms of demand for the following calendar year. When we did those interviews late last fall, I don't think there's any question that we were hearing a good bit of conservatism and a good bit of caution from our large industrial customer base. And if you recall, those interviews were being done at a time when the whole issue about sequester, the whole issue about federal debt ceiling and everything we went through at the end of the year was very much on people's minds. And our customers are proving -- I mean to have given us really good input. I mean, they were expecting a soft first quarter in terms of what they were seeing for orders and demand. And that has turned out to be the case. When you basically take out leap year and weather normalize, our industrial sales were about dead on to where we thought they would be in Q1. Now, we're projecting a little bit of uptick, not much, in the remaining quarters. So in essence, what we're seeing is an economy treading water. The only 2 sectors that showed any material growth at all -- we serve 17 different industrial sectors of the economy. The only 2 sectors that showed any growth at all were, believe it or not, printing and publishing and production of plastics. Everything else pretty much just right where it was. Not a lot of big upside, not a lot of downside. Just treading water. We're a bit cautiously optimistic over the course of the remainder of the year, but no, we were not deviating from the sales forecast. There's no indication yet that things are really turning around.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then second and last question. In terms of the buyback. Obviously, the average price at which you have already bought back stock is pretty good relative to -- where the stock is trading now, what can you tell us about how you think about the potential for completing a buyback relative to other opportunities and deployed capital with your stock trading at such a big P/E [ph]  and price to book multiple?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, it's a good question, Greg, and we continue to look everyday at whether or not we want to be in the market buying stock. Over the long-term, I can tell you, it would not be the intention of the management here to build up a big cash reserve. I don't think that's what we're being paid for from our stockholders. But obviously, we're going to be opportunistic as we have been in the past on share buyback.", "Operator", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "First question here, sort of on the structure of these asset sales, if you will. Could you guys talk to what is being currently contemplated in the state or on how they would -- what this would look like? Obviously, it doesn't seem to be more rate-based, but some sort of contract of sorts, and when this all would hash out? Obviously you mentioned end of summer now. What does that translate to in terms of actually putting down dollars and getting returns on those investments?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay. We'll handle kind of each question one at a time. In terms of the process itself, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the governor has put a provision in the state budget that would authorize the State Department of Administration to conduct a process, if you will, to sell a number of state-owned properties including power plants and steam-generating plants that the state owns. The budget itself needs to be passed because a state is on a fiscal year ending June. The budget itself, in all likelihood, will be passed end of June sometime early July. Assuming the provision holds in the state budget, then the state Department of Administration would set up a process. We're not certain how the State Department of Administration would actually design the process. But we are quite certain this would not become part of our traditional rate base. This would not be subject to Public Service Commission review and approval as it's currently constituted, anyway. And so it would not become part of the rate base although Allen and I would expect, given the fact that the process would unfold assuming the law passed in the second half of this year, then we really would be looking at 2014.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes. I would assume that if the bill is passed of course and the DOA moves expeditiously to ask for proposals, you could easily see financial closing in the first half of 2014.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And then one other point. We would obviously, in any bid that we would make, we would obviously require a very transparent and firm power sales, or steam sales agreement. So these would not become -- while they would not be rate base per se, they would not become merchant units either.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Would it be fair to say that the return profile of this would be somewhat akin to a traditionally regulated asset? Is that a fair statement?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That would certainly be our current thinking, yes.", "Operator", "Andy Bischof with MorningStar.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could just comment on the levels switching from gas back to coal in your generation portfolio? A couple of your peers have kind of posted dramatic shifts in generation mix given the recent rebound, and was just curious to what you're seeing.", "Gale E. Klappa", "We'll be to. Allen actually has some specifics statistics for you and I think the frame that we're basically seeing -- remember that song by Maxine Nightingale, \"Gonna get right back where you started from?\" Those are Allen's statistics in a nutshell. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well with that as a lead in, let me talk about that in 2 different ways. One way to sort of think about it in terms of energy mix. So in other words, what percentage of our electricity is produced by coal as opposed to natural gas. If you look pre-2012, so if you look at sort of the average of 2008, '09, '10, '11, 3 or 4 years before 2012, we were at about 59% of our electricity was produced with coal. Last year we're about 45%. So in 2012, we're at 45%. However, this year we see that bouncing back to 57%. So at this point at least, 2012 looks to be a bit of an anomaly because, as Gale pointed out, with his vocal analogy, the 57% is pretty close to the 59% that we saw before 2012. That was driven not only by lower natural gas prices or low natural gas prices in 2012, but we did take a very long outage at our South Oak Creek power plant when we did the tie-ins of the AQCS equipment, so we had both of those things going on. In terms of fuel burn, we burned about 8 million -- just over 8 million tons of coal last year. I expect we'll be close to 11 million tons this year. So we see coal bouncing back. Natural gas last year, we're at 45.5 BCF. My current forecast is about 33.  So, at this point at least, it doesn't look like a secular trend. But obviously if we saw low natural gas prices again, you could have somewhat of a replay of 2012.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And do have one other advantage, and that is, when you look at the efficiency and the heat rates of our new Power The Future units, I believe our new Port Washington natural gas fire combined cycle units have the best heat rate in the Midwest market in our new expansion units at Oak Creek and our older units at Oak Creek are in the top decile in the Midwest in terms of efficiency. So they will be dispatched depending upon the comparative costs of coal and natural gas. But we have very efficient units that are serving our customers well.", "Operator", "Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just to follow-up on that question. What natural gas price range would you kind of start to see some season meaningful switching back to gas?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well if you -- in order to answer that question, you have to talk about what type of coal are you using? At Sub-bituminous coal, if your unit -- and remember our Pleasant Prairie Plant and our South Oak Creek, they are already 100% sub-bituminous coal. So to actually see them being out of the market as compared to natural gas, you'd have to see natural gas down and say maybe at the $2.75 to $2.50 range. So you'd have to see pretty low gas prices to actually see those units displaced. Now, the current -- the Oak Creek expansion units are currently on bituminous coal. So we really want to, as Gale mentioned in the script, we want to be able to burn blends of sub debt and bituminous coal. But with those units on bituminous coal, you can see those displaced in gas prices in the $3.50 to $3.75 range on bituminous coal. But if we can eventually get to high blends of sub-bituminous coal at those Oak Creek plants, I wouldn't see the displacement occurring until those much lower natural gas prices that I talked about, that $2.50 to $2.75.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And secondly, just a point of clarification, you expect O&M to be flat to up 2%, is that what you said?", "Allen L. Leverett", "For the year, that's our plan. Flat to plus 2%.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly, how is April weather?", "Gale E. Klappa", "April weather, up until today, has been a bit chilly. But we're having 81 degrees and sunshine today. But we have had a chilly April.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Does your second quarter guidance bake that in and assume normal?", "Gale E. Klappa", "At the moment, because June also has a fair amount of air conditioning demand in our forecast, we've decided to simply stick with normal weather for our second quarter guidance.", "Operator", "Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Just a few quick questions. First of all, I guess when we look at the Page 7 of the factors affecting earnings for the quarter, I wasn't really clear what the rate impact was. I mean it sounds like you guys had a rate increase beginning of the year. And just -- I don't see where that showed up.", "Gale E. Klappa", "All right. We'll let Pat or Steve give you the line time where it shows up we did have a rate increase. But we had a rate decrease for our natural gas distribution businesses. But a rate increase for our retail electric business. Steve?", "Stephen P. Dickson", "Yes, that's correct. And the rate increases were offset on electric side by costs. So that's how come it didn't fall through there. And on the gas side you said the decrease of the gas was offset by reduced O&M.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm sorry. Could you repeat that again?", "Stephen P. Dickson", "As Gale said, our rate increases were offset by cost increases and the decreases on the gas side were offset by cost decreases in O&M.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So -- but I mean just -- when I look at this, it looks like weather was a big driver obviously and if we take weather and the impact of leap year out, I mean -- I know there was depreciation, and what have you, but just on that operating level, it just seemed that the quarter -- that there was obviously something dragging it. I was just wondering what that might be.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, when you look at -- when say dragging it, I mean there were a number of things that entered back in to our O&M expenses. For example, last year as Pat mentioned, while we had a base rate freeze, we also had a regulatory amortization holiday. So we began -- although in some cases with a bit longer amortizing lives, we began flowing amortization back through our income statements. We obviously had just a touch of other costs. Basically, we're exactly on plan. I mean we're projecting 0% to 2% increase in O&M. That's where we are. The higher revenues are somewhat offset by various factors and yes, the weather, the share repurchases and the uptick at WE Power were the positive items that carried the day.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. I mean, I was still taking that into account. I'll follow-up offline, just maybe just my own math here. And then, when it comes to the depreciation lines, you guys said you did some study that helps out by $3 million in the quarter.", "Gale E. Klappa", "No.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm sorry. What was that then?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Steve can explain that.", "Stephen P. Dickson", "The depreciation, that's fairly simple. The depreciation as Pat mentioned in the remarks, the big driver there is the depreciation this year on the air quality-control project. That was over $800 million project and the depreciation, that was pretty significant on that. But I want to go back your question because it was a good question on where is the pricing in the factors. And this factors sheet just had the high-level items. On the electric side of the business, we had rate increase. On the gas side of the business as we said, it's a decrease. So those 2 basically wash. It's not that big. We're filing our 10Q Thursday afternoon and we'll have much more detail in that. But the short answer is, the rate increase on the electric was offset by the decline on the gas. Does that make sense?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Sure. And we'll check out the 10-Q. But I did think that you guys were lengthening the life -- the depreciable life of some assets. Did I get that wrong?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No. What we have -- no, you probably mistook something that was said. There's no significant difference in the depreciable lives of our assets.", "Stephen P. Dickson", "In 2012, we did a study on the new WE Power asset and in 2012 we made that change. But that's consistent '12 and '13. So that was something that happened in 2012.", "Gale E. Klappa", "We did a final study on the asset lives -- the depreciable lives of our new Power The Future units in 2012, but that should be, as Steve said, that should be -- what you're seeing in '13 should be completely comparable.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "And that would be with synced up with rates, I would assume, right?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No. Because, WE Power being...", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Got you. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, got you. And then in terms of the sales forecast and what have you, I don't want to always ask this question, but it does seem that -- it seems sort of weaker than expected. I mean, has there been any change in your outlook at all in terms of usage? I mean -- I know Greg know asked you a little bit about this on the industrial side, but I'm just wondering on the sort of the nonindustrial side? Any change in that at all?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No. And it's a good question and you're right to ask question. We sit back at look at the numbers and ask ourselves the same question. But if you kind of take a look at setting industrial side is you're asking us to do. Actually on a weather normal basis, we were better than we thought on residential. On a weather normal basis, we were a little bit worse than we thought on small commercial and industrial. But it's a 3-month period, and weather normalization is not that quite precise. So when we sit back and look at the mix of residential and small commercial and industrial, actually I think we're as well off, if not right on target to where we thought we would be after the first quarter.", "Gale E. Klappa", "All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you again for participating.

A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our 2013 second quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of We Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, our Controller; and Scott Lauber, our newly named Treasurer.", "Effective tomorrow, Allen will officially assume the role of President of Wisconsin Energy. Allen, of course, has been a key contributor to our success over the past decade, and this promotion recognizes his leadership skills and the broader operational role that he currently plays in the company. I will continue to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive. Allen, congratulations.", "Pat Keyes will be reviewing our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we're reporting earnings from continuing operations of $0.52 a share for the second quarter of 2013. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $0.51 a share for the second quarter of 2012. Our earnings were boosted by stronger natural gas sales during a cooler and longer-than-normal spring, a slight uptick in earnings at We power and our share repurchase program. However, the cooler temperatures in June significantly reduced consumption of electricity, particularly for air-conditioning.", "Turning now to the economy of our region, Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 6.8% in June, well below the national average. However, in forecasting our second quarter sales for this year, we did anticipate some continued sluggishness in the regional economy. And that sluggishness was clearly evident in the numbers you saw this morning.", "Energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, were down by 4.1% compared to the second quarter a year ago. As you may recall however, we experienced exceptionally warm weather in last year's second quarter. So when you factor in normal weather, whatever that is, sales to our large commercial and industrial group in the most recent quarter were down by 2.1%. Three of the industrial sectors that we served did show some encouraging growth during the quarter, printing and publishing, plastics and the chemical and air separation industries.", "Also we're continuing to see customer growth across our system. New electric service installations are up this year by nearly 3%, and new requests for natural gas service increased by more than 7% compared to the same period last year.", "Now as many of you know, we have 1 major construction project underway, our biomass-fueled power plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. Construction is now nearly 90% complete, and we're on schedule for commercial operation by the end of this year. Since our last call, progress has continued. We achieved a significant milestone in May when the auxiliary natural gas boiler began supplying steam to the Domtar paper mill, which is located immediately adjacent to our new plant.", "In addition, we've successfully completed the oil flush of the steam turbine generator, and the chemical cleaning of the boiler is now complete. As of today, 47 of the plant's 80 systems are in the start-up and commissioning stages. In about a month, we expect to fire natural gas in the biomass boiler for the first time.", "As I've noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. The unit will efficiently produce electricity for the grid and steam for the Domtar paper mill, and we'll be able to dispatch the unit, a benefit that's simply not available with solar or wind generation.", "Overall, our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total approximately $265 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. And as I mentioned, we're targeting commercial operation before the end of 2013.", "Switching gears now. You'll recall that in 2011, our board authorized us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock. That authorization runs through the end of this year. During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 1,043,000 shares. Since the program began, we've repurchased 5,974,000 shares at a cost that is just under $206.6 million. That equates to an average purchase price of $34.57 a share.", "Moving to our recent dividend announcement. At our July meeting, the board voted to accelerate to the second half of 2013, the dividend action that was planned for the first quarter 2014. As a result, the directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3825 a share on the company's common stock. This is an increase of $0.0425 a share on the quarterly dividend, and raises the annual rate from $1.36 a share to $1.53 a share. The board also reaffirmed our dividend policy that calls for a payout ratio to rise to 65% to 70% of our earnings in 2017, a level that will be more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.", "And now, I'd like to touch for a few minutes on our growth plan and on the investment opportunities that will unfold during the next several years. You may recall that our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2013 through 2017. In this 5-year plan, we're shifting, of course, from the large high-profile projects that were part of our Power the Future effort to many smaller-scale projects designed to upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. Over the next 5 years, we'll place a greater focus on pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations, the very building blocks of our delivery business. We've already begun rebuilding 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines, replacing 18,500 aging power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally, hundreds of substation components.", "On the natural gas distribution side of our business, we've begun the work to replace 1,250 miles of gas mains, 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and approximately 233,000 meter sets. The primary risks associated with these type of projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the major projects we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest. And of course, we'll continue to update you as these needed infrastructure projects move forward.", "Another key investment we're planning is the conversion of our Valley Power Plant to natural gas. The Valley plant is a cogeneration facility, located along the Menomonee River, very near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam to heat more than 450 buildings in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our distribution network. We filed for Construction Authority with the Wisconsin Commission on April 26, and the notice of proceeding was issued by the Commission on June 21. If approved, we plan to complete the Valley conversion in late 2015 or early 2016 at an estimated cost of $65 million to $70 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. It's important to note that before we begin the conversion, we must upgrade the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. That upgrade began physically in March of this year, and we estimated that it will cost approximately $26 million.", "Converting Valley to natural gas has several very important benefits. First, it will reduce our operating costs and it will enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.", "Turning now to developments at Oak Creek. We continue to make progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you may recall, the units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous and Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal, blending the 2 types of coal could save our customers a significant amount of money. Our current estimate, $25 million to $50 million a year, depending upon the mix. So after receiving the necessary approvals, we began testing a blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at our Oak Creek expansion units in May. Testing is expected to continue into 2015 and will help us identify the equipment modifications that would be needed to increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal in our fuel mix at Oak Creek.", "Shifting now to our hydroelectric plants, you may recall that we plan to build a new powerhouse at our Twin Falls hydroelectric site on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls is 1 of 13 hydroelectric plants in our system. It was built back in 1912, and while the plant is licensed to operate until 2040, the existing powerhouse is really in need of repair. We considered several alternatives, but the most prudent course of action is to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We received a Certificate of Authority for the project from the Wisconsin Commission in May. We're expecting a permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the license amendment from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission later this year. If we receive the final approvals in a timely manner, we would begin construction by the spring of 2014, with completion planned in 2016. We estimate the cost of the project to be $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "It's important to note that the investments we're planning on the generation side of our business are expected to lower costs for customers. For example, the Valley conversion is projected to save up to $20 million annually in operating costs. And our fuel flexibility effort at Oak Creek could save customers, as I mentioned, up to $50 million a year, depending on the fuel mix.", "Now turning to the natural gas distribution side of our business. We filed an application with the Wisconsin Commission in March to build a natural gas lateral in the West Central region of Wisconsin. The 85-mile line would run between Eau Claire County and the city of Tomah in Monroe County. The project will address reliability concerns in the Western part of Wisconsin and meet growing customer demand, driven in part by customers converting from propane to natural gas, and of course, the recent growth of the sand mining industry in the region. In addition, 7 communities have passed resolutions now authorizing us to begin operating natural gas distribution systems within their borders, and these are communities that currently do not have natural gas distribution service. So if our project is approved, construction of the line would begin in early 2015, with an in-service date during the fourth quarter of 2015. The projected cost is $150 million to $170 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "We're also continuing to follow another possible investment opportunity, the potential sale of the State of Wisconsin's electric and steam generating plants. On June 30, Governor Walker signed into law a new state budget that includes a provision expanding the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties. This means that the administration now has the authority to sell the state's electric and steam plants. No formal timetable has been announced, but if a sale does take place, we will expect that it would occur in either 2014 or early 2015.", "And before closing my remarks, I'd like to briefly touch on one of the recent developments related to our Michigan operations. Under Michigan law, the retail customers may choose an alternative energy supplier to provide power supply service. The law limits customer choice to 10% of Michigan's retail sales, but the law excludes the iron ore mines from this cap. Of course, we continue to provide the distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer's power supplier. In late July, the 2 iron ore mines we've been serving on uninterruptible tariff asked to switch to an alternative supplier effective September 1. In addition, several smaller customers have chosen an alternative supplier. We do not expect the loss of the mines or the smaller customers to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or projections for 2013, and we're evaluating our options for mitigating this loss of load for 2014 and beyond.", "And now finally, I'd like to address a number of questions we've received recently about potential mergers and acquisitions. Our approach to mergers and acquisitions remains unchanged. As many of you are aware, we use 3 criteria to evaluate any potential opportunity: First, we would have to believe that an acquisition would be accretive to our earnings per share by the end of the first year; secondly, it would need to be substantially credit neutral; and finally, after due diligence, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of the acquisition would be at least equal to our stand-alone growth rate. Allen and I have applied these criteria for, gosh, for the 10 years we've been at Wisconsin Energy and the criteria remain firmly in place today.", "And now, with more details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2013, here's Pat.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2013 second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.52 a share, compared with $0.51 a share for the same quarter in 2012. Results were slightly better than last year, primarily because of increased natural gas sales, the positive impact of our share repurchases and increased earnings at We power.", "Our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $229.5 million as compared to $222.6 million in 2012, an increase of $6.9 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income in the second quarter of 2013 totaled $138.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million over the second quarter of 2012.", "Our second quarter earnings were helped by $15.4 million due to the pricing increases that went into effect January 1 of this year. We also experienced $5.5 million of favorable fuel recoveries as compared to the second quarter last year. Our earnings were hurt by $6.3 million because of the increased depreciation expense, largely driven by the environmental projects at the older Oak Creek units that were completed last year. Finally, we estimate that weather reduced our operating income by $13 million as compared to the second quarter of last year. Overall, these were the primary factors that netted to a $5.3 million improvement in utility operating income.", "I would also like to remind you of one item that is affecting our quarterly earnings. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to receive a federal tax grant when we complete our new biomass facility later this year. Our customers are currently receiving the benefits of this grant through bill credits. However, accounting rules do not allow us to recognize the grant income until the plant is placed into service. We estimate that our second quarter earnings would have been $0.03 a share higher, and our first half earnings would've been $0.06 a share higher, if we had recorded the grant income to match the bill credits.", "Now turning to our Non-Utility segment. Operating income in this segment was up $1.3 million this quarter because of the final approval of our Power the Future plant costs in the last Wisconsin rate case. We expect this increase to continue each quarter through 2013.", "Taking the changes for these 2 segments together and a slight improvement at corporate and other, you arrive at the $6.9 million increase in operating income.", "Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $17.3 million in the second quarter, which is a $1.1 million improvement over the same period in 2012.", "Our other income net declined by $2.8 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. The AFUDC decreased because we completed the final stages of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units last year.", "In addition, our net interest expense increased by $1.8 million, primarily because of the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units. Once the construction was complete, we stopped capitalizing interest.", "When compared to the second quarter of 2012, our pretax income is up by $3.4 million, and our income tax expense is higher by $3.7 million, causing the slight decrease in net income of $300,000. The higher effective tax rate this year is, again, partly driven by lower AFUDC. Our effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be between 36% and 37%.", "Combining all these items brings you to $119 million of net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2013 or earnings of $0.52 per share.", "During the first 6 months of 2013, our adjusted operating cash flows totaled $684.2 million, which is a $47.9 million increase from the same period in 2012. This increase largely came from the lower working capital needs and cash received this year through customer rates for the recovery of regulatory assets. This was partially offset by a $24.9 million decrease in restricted cash that related to the 2012 refund of the Department of Energy settlement.", "Our total capital expenditures decreased by $6.7 million in the first half of 2013 as compared to 2012. This reflects the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units.", "We paid $155.6 million in common dividends for the first half of 2013, an increase of $17.3 million over the first half of 2012. As Gale mentioned earlier, the board announced its decision to accelerate to the second half of 2013 the dividend action that was originally planned for the first quarter of 2014. This equates to a quarterly dividend of $0.3825 a share, up from our prior $0.34 a share.", "Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.2% at the end of June. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid security is common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. The projected year-end debt-to-total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2012 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "As shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales of electricity decreased by 2.5% in the first half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2012. Our normalized sales were down by 1.5%. All normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of leap year and weather.", "Looking at the individual customer segments, with the cool June weather, we saw actual residential sales, for the first half of the year, down 0.9%. On a normalized basis, the sales were down 0.3%.", "Across our small commercial/industrial group, sales for the first 6 months were down by 0.1%. But on a normalized basis, sales to small commercial/industrial customers were up 0.4%.", "On a normalized basis, sales for the first half of 2013 in the large commercial/industrial segment, excluding the iron ore mines, were down 1.4%.", "On the gas side of the business, total volumes the first half of the year increased by 11.8%, primarily due to colder weather than last year. On a normalized basis, and excluding the volumes used in power generation, gas volumes increased by 2% compared to 2012. This is attributed to an increase in customers, fuel switching to natural gas and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry. Overall, these gas volumes were better than our projections. The overall effect of the electric and gas results are in line with our sales expectations.", "Turning to other items of interest. In June of 2013, our electric subsidiary issued a $250 million 5-year bond at a coupon of 1.7%. This bond essentially replaced a $300 million bond with a coupon of 4.5% that came due in May.", "Finally, looking to our earnings forecast. First, we're tightening our 2013 guidance. Our prior guidance was in a range of $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. Our new 2013 guidance will be from $2.41 a share to $2.48 a share.", "Before I turn things back to Gale, I would also like to provide guidance on our third quarter earnings. As background, we earned $0.67 per share in the third quarter of 2012. However, a hot summer boosted our third quarter earnings last year by $0.06 per share. Also as mentioned earlier, we cannot record the income from the federal tax grant for our biomass plant until the plant is placed into service. The customer bill credits will continue in the third quarter, and this is expected to reduce our third quarter earnings this year by $0.03 per share. Taking these factors into consideration, and assuming normal weather, we estimate our 2013 third quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.", "And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Greg Gordon with ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Quick and simple question. You've obviously tightened your earnings guidance range. You've raised the lower end of the range. That's good, but it seems to me, if my memory is correct, that your sales growth is trailing behind what your beginning of the year budget expectation was. So can you tell us what you've done in terms of a midcourse correction to stay on track to have such a good year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I appreciate it, Greg. Well, the first thing is, the bill wasn't too bad at Catch 35. It's a little inside joke, folks. At any rate, if you look at our natural gas sales projections, remember our natural gas distribution business is about 20% of our total business. And then, you look at our electric sales projections. You put it all in one pot and we're about on target with where we thought we would be overall for energy consumption. So there's not been a big deviation up to this point, through the first 6 months of this year, against our sales growth forecast when you put the whole group of companies together.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got you. So I was focused on the electric numbers, and -- but the gas numbers are ahead of plan?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Exactly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "On the state power plants, the timeframe, Gale, I think you laid out was probably a little longer than we might have thought. Maybe we were too optimistic or it there some extra steps that have to go through here? And just could you update on how you see that process playing out?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Happy to, Jonathan. The truth of the matter is, the state has not announced -- or the Department of Administration, on behalf of the state, has not announced a formal timetable. We know that this is something that they are planning, that they are putting together a process to move forward with. But they've not announced a formal timetable. So the information we gave you in the prepared remarks, it was a sale that would be perhaps a 2014 or early 2015 event, that's our best guess at this stage of the game because they've not announced a timetable. But I don't sense any slippage in their desire to try to put a process together and move forward. It's just we don't have a very good handle, because no one has talked about a specific timetable at this stage of the game. On the other hand, the governor has said publicly how he would like to use the proceeds from the sale if a sale takes place. So there's no lack of attention at the state in terms of trying to put together a process. I hope that helps, Jonathan.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And the other thing on timing, it seems like kind of you're now expecting not to start the Twin Falls construction until next year, rather than later this year. Is that just -- but you're still on track for 2016. What's going on there?", "Gale E. Klappa", "You're correct. We would plan to start next year. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "That's right, in the spring of 2014. So we need one last permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and then, the final approval from FERC. So we expect to get those well before year end, which will allow us to -- when the construction season starts in Michigan, to do the construction starting in spring of '14.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "You were saying fall of '13, last quarter. I was just wondering, what's taken longer?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, that DNR permit that we need, we have to have that Wisconsin DNR permit before the FERC will act. So it's taken us a bit longer to get that Wisconsin DNR permit than we had hoped. Because part of what's happening with this project, Jonathan, this might be too much detail, but we're literally moving the powerhouse from the Michigan side of the river to the Wisconsin side of the river. And because of that, even though it's the same river, the Wisconsin regulators have to weigh in. So that's taking a little longer than we expected.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Thank you for the question. We don't, by the way, think anything is off track here. It's just a matter of working through the permitting process, and that's taking just a hair longer.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "I wanted to move to a strategic line of questioning, if you don't mind.", "Gale E. Klappa", "We'd be happy to talk strategy.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So as we know, this back-to-basic strategy emerged in earnest in, call it 2005. It was centered on rate-based growth and cost containment efforts. So with that backdrop, let me look at the cost side of the ledger, if you don't mind. One of the key themes this earnings season has been containing costs, yet with 7 to 8 years of cost-reduction efforts already underway, I'm having a tough time reconciling how much fruit might be left on a proverbial tree, so to speak. So the question to you is, could you shed some light on how Wisconsin balances your -- Wisconsin Energy that is, balances your near-term cost containment efforts without triggering a potentially longer-term negative impact on the business, be it earnings or reliability issues and the like? And importantly, how we should think about where the future cost savings could come from?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure, I'll give it a shot, and we'll be happy to ask Pat and Allen to pitch in as well. Let me start with kind of our approach, because I think that if we talk in some detail about our approach, it might help shed light on the other aspects of your question. Our approach, essentially, can be broken down into 2 pieces. Piece 1 is we are -- and I think you saw this reflected in a lot of what we talked about in terms of the capital projects, particularly on the generation side of the business. Our first approach is to look for and carry out investment opportunities that can actually lower O&M costs and lower cost for customers. So if we can make a capital investment that actually takes our O&M costs down, that gives us an investment opportunity, but it also directly benefits customers. And we have a couple of very specific projects along those lines that we touched on, and I'll ask Allen just to briefly touch again. That would be Valley and our Oak Creek fuel flexibility initiative. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes, and just on that note, Jim, in the case of Valley, that's a fuel-switching project. So there, what we propose to do is switch from coal to natural gas. Of course, when you go away from solid fuel for this kind of plant, much lower level of employment at the plant, the great deal of expenses and capital investments that will just go away because you're no longer handling solid fuel and handling the combustion byproducts that come along with solid fuel. So as Gale mentioned in the prepared remarks, that could be up to a $20 million-a-year savings. On sort of the fuel flexibility front, Gale also mentioned the project at the Oak Creek expansion plan where we're -- want to make investments to be able to burn a blend of bit and sub-bit coal. Depending on what we're able to do in terms of an ultimate level of sub-bituminous coal, we could be looking at $50 million a year in savings. Now, of course, those aren't O&M savings. They're fuel savings. But that still serves, I mean because ultimately, customers don't discriminate between O&M and fuel, they're just looking at their total bill. So that, certainly, is another source of savings. And I know, in other areas, Pat, we're looking at things.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, that's kind of piece 1, Jim. And as Allen said, and we're going to ask Pat to comment here, on the nongeneration side of our business, we believe there are numerous opportunities to invest in automation and process improvement to take O&M out of the business. And Pat can give you a couple examples of that. And then, I'll come back with a third piece after Pat can give you a couple of examples of how we can automate our processes, use IT technology to cut O&M. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Sure, be glad to, Gale. So Jim, I think as Gale alluded to, at the core of this are lots of small initiatives where we identify where our process inefficiencies are, where we have a lot of hand-offs, where we have a lot of people pushing paper and not thinking in effect, and figuring out how we can better automate them. And that's not any one big project. That's a series of several that we will do year-on-year-on-year. So that's kind of the core example. But there's other more tactical examples. And let me use customer service as one of them. There are segments of our customers, generally speaking the younger folks, that don't really like the whole experience of calling into a call center. So the more functionality or more ways of interacting with us that we can make available on the web or on mobile apps, those customers would prefer to shift to that channel of interaction. And that is a win for them, it's also a win for us because that's a lower-cost channel for them to interact with than picking up the phone. So we've got several ideas that we continue to roll out applications in that area. Another area we're looking at is in parts of our service territory. That is, universities where we've got high volumes of people going on and off during move season, would there be an advantage to put remote disconnect technology in those areas so that we don't have to send people out every spring and every fall to disconnect and reconnect the meter? Again, we're still evaluating it. May roll that out over time. But that's another example of a place we still have opportunity for cost take-out. So with that, Gale, I'll turn it back to you.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Terrific. And you may be getting more detail than you want here, Jim. But there's a third piece and that's what I generally call line losses. And that's been one of our focuses over time, in terms of how do you reduce line losses. And there are all kinds of ways, both from a process standpoint and a technical standpoint on line losses. And we've been pretty successful at actually reducing our line losses over time. We were able to do that in England. We've been able to do that here. So there's just hundreds of little initiatives, all focused on process improvement, automation and investment that can take O&M out of the business over time. I hope that helps, Jim.", "James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, it is. So the bottom line is that you replace OpEx with CapEx, you keep your cost structure relatively flat by automating stuff, and that your earnings growth prospectively isn't predicated on job cuts or major cost-reduction initiatives. Is that right, the way I think about it?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I think you've nailed it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "So going back to one of the little details there on Michigan, I'd be curious, what caused the switching decision now, of any period? And frankly, you alluded to the mines being an exception. Are all the customers here mines that you're talking about? And perhaps, what are the alternative solutions, if you will, that you're evaluating potentially?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay, sure. Well, the 2 major customers, obviously, are the iron ore mines. We really don't know what motivated them. I mean they have been eligible to switch, I believe since 2002, when that First Choice law was introduced in Michigan. And the last amendment to the law in which they received the -- well, actually, the Choice was introduced in Michigan in 2002. There was a 2008 amendment to the Choice law that specifically exempted the mines from the cap. So they've been eligible to switch for -- well, ever since 2008. What specifically motivated them at this stage of the game, we really don't know for certain. But again, I think there's some internal dynamics up there at the 2 mines, the Empire Mine and the Tilden Mine. Those are the names of the 2 mines. One of the dynamics, certainly, that we expected was that the Empire Mine, based on their public announcements, is going to close for good at the end of 2014. And we're not certain, based on the information they've given us, just how much they intended to produce out of that mine anyway in 2014. So the switch of the Empire Mine may have had something to do with the final stages of its life. Well, I'm speculating though, we just don't know for certain what motivated the particular timing for their switch. The other customers that have switched so far -- I might add, by the way, that we are the last utility that I'm aware of in Michigan to see customer switching. From 2002 up until June of this year, we hadn't lost a single customer in the Upper Peninsula. But the other customers who are switching are, by and large, very small customers. I know of a paint store, I know of a bank branch. Very, very small customers. So I hope that helps.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Absolutely. And just in the remarketing, I mean, if you can give us some sense of a net impact. It's probably fairly modest, but ...", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I think in terms of remarketing, and certainly, we have some opportunities for serving some other customers, but also, we simply have to look at -- as we have been looking at, we simply have to look at the future of the Presque Isle Power Plant up in the Upper Peninsula. Normally, if you lost -- if you were in a normal business and you lost a significant customer load, even though it may or may not have been particularly profitable, you would look at, well, what capacity do I still need? So one of the things we obviously have to reexamine is the future of the Presque Isle Power Plant. It's all very early days and we will work our way through this; having active discussions internally, obviously, and with the Michigan Public Service Commission. And we'll just step-by-step, methodically, logically and productively work our way through this.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "A quick clarifying question on the share buyback. What was the average purchase price in the quarter? And I apologize, I missed the total shares since program initiation?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We have that in the script, and we'll go back to the page here in terms of the total number of shares for the program.", "James Patrick Keyes", "So Andy, this is Pat. For the program, it was 5.974 million shares at around $206 million, so an average share price of $34.57. For the quarter, we purchased just over 1 million shares for just over $43 million.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And one other question. You've talked in detail about your growth opportunities, which was much appreciated. In the past, you've highlighted the additional opportunities at ATC, not only within Wisconsin, Michigan, but outside that footprint. Any update on those additional opportunities or is this announcement still pretty out in the future?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I think all of the information we provided you over time about the 10-year growth forecast for American Transmission Company still applies today. They, as you probably remember, Andy, they do a rolling 10-year forecast that's updated every autumn. And I believe it's October.", "Allen L. Leverett", "It's done in October, Andy. This is Allen. Yes.", "Gale E. Klappa", "So nothing different. Still on track and a new update coming in October.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "What was the fuel cover on an absolute basis? I know it was $5 million relative to last year.", "Gale E. Klappa", "The famous Steve Dixon is turning to that page right now.", "Stephen P. Dickson", "Yes, our fuel recovery, we are above the 2% band, so we are deferring everything about the 2% band. And through the 6 months, we're at about $16.6 million, which is where the band is, and we're a little bit above that. We're at $19.7 million, so we deferred the amount above $16 million. Does that make sense?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "So $3 million?", "Stephen P. Dickson", "$3 million is what we've deferred.", "Gale E. Klappa", "What we've deferred. Yes, so in other words, we're allowed to keep for our shareholders anything up to 2% above the target amount or our shareholders have to eat anything below the 2% target amount. And what Steve is saying is, we were just above the 2% target amount. So what you saw in our earnings was the amount up to the 2% target. The remaining over recovery, we've deferred. And if that holds, that will go back to customers.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "So you ate $2 million last year, is that the right way to think about it, to get to $5 million this year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, that is correct.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just because you mentioned it about line losses, what are you doing with conservation voltage regulation? What's the opportunity there?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, obviously, there's a lot of work going on around the industry related to that. I know EPRI has a project related to that. Some utilities are looking at it. We're looking at it, but nothing definitive yet.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So your work so far has been on the utility side of the meter?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is largely correct, yes.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Natural gas demand. We've seen in a handful of utilities, I think you guys as well, what is a little bit of a pickup in weather-normalized demand for natural gas from utilities to their customers. Could you just comment on that? What are the trends you're seeing, whether you think it's a short-term blip or whether it's something structural? After all, if you look at like 10, 20, 30-year cycles of natural gas demand served by utilities, it had actually been on a downward slope. So just curious if this is a short-term thing or something else to look out for?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good question, Michael, and I'll give you my theory, for what it's worth. First of all, I think you're right. Here and across the country, we've seen a little change in terms of the historic past 20 years where usage per customer was going down at a slow, but reasonably steady rate. And clearly -- well, let's start with demand. Most of the demand for natural gas in a state like Wisconsin is coming from residential and small commercial customers. In fact, about 2/3 of the natural gas historically consumed in the state of Wisconsin is consumed by residential and small commercial customers. So there, very weather-dependent, obviously, year to year, but when you try to weather normalize, the big change has been the efficiency of furnaces. So if, for example, you replaced a 20-year-old gas-fueled furnace with a brand new one, you would get a significant percentage pickup in efficiency. And I think -- and it's that way with virtually every natural gas appliance in your home. The new appliances are simply much, much more efficient. So I believe that was the big factor driving this kind of slow but steady decline year after year in usage, natural gas usage per customer. Now the last couple of years as natural gas prices have really been low and have stayed low, we have seen a break in that pattern. And you can see it in the numbers we reported today. Couple of things going on. First of all, you know when it costs you less per term and your wife is cold, you know you're going to turn it up. So I think that's piece 1. The second piece is -- so I think there's not as much price disincentive to being more comfortable and to using more natural gas. So that may be one structural change. I think the second is we're seeing an uptick again in conversions. If you look at the price spread in most parts of the country between propane and natural gas, there's still a very significant price spread that incentivizes customers to switch from the use of propane to the use of natural gas. In fact, I think I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we've gotten authorizations and requests now from 7 smaller communities in the western part of Wisconsin, asking us to begin providing natural gas distribution service so that their residents have the opportunity to switch from either oil, propane baseload heat to natural gas. So I think that the pricing of natural gas today is causing a changed behavior in the marketplace, driving more customer connections, driving a move away from propane. And that is mitigating, I think, the increased efficiency that customers are seeing when they upgrade their equipment. So I hope that helps.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It helped. How do you think about what -- you've talked at length about what's kind of in guidance or in your views about weather-normalized electricity demand. What's in your views for weather-normalized gas demand?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, until we see -- I'll be honest with you. Until we see more of a pattern here, I'm not sure we're ready to declare it a structural change. But we're obviously taking a very hard look at it, and if we see enough evidence that there's a structural change, it will change our long-term forecast. For now, candidly, the weather has been so abnormal, either abnormally warm or abnormally cold in the last 2 or 3 winters, and you know, I've talked about the limitations of the weather normalization techniques. I think we need to see a little more data and hopefully, more normal weather so that we can really understand whether the weather is driving some of this change, and our weather normalization techniques are limited, which they are, or whether there's true structural change. So I don't mean to give you a vague answer at all, but I think in another 24 months, I hope we would have a better answer for you because we'll have more data.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Going back strategically, under what conditions do you think the board or what conditions would be ripe for the board to raise your payout ratio above 70%?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I can tell you about how Allen and I both look at it. And our board would certainly have a view, but they tend to follow our logic very well in terms of the financial structure. If you step back and you say, \"All right, there are several components of the business that we want to make sure all fit together.\" All right? So the first thing we look at is what is our cash need? And that's driven by what is our investment opportunity. And as we said, for the next several years, 2013 through 2017, we expect an investment opportunity ranging from $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion. So that's Step 1. We identify our investment opportunities and our cash needs. Step 2 is we know that we want to maintain a strong A-category credit rating. So we know what debt-to-total capital and equity-to-total capital, we know what that needs to look like on a percentage basis. And then, thirdly, we don't really want to be forced -- unless there's an incredible opportunity that we didn't see, we don't want to be forced into issuing equity. And so you put all that together and out falls a sustainable medium-term dividend payout ratio. We really look at it systematically, block by block, in terms of the components of the business. And so I think logically, to directly answer your question: What would motivate the board to materially increase the payout ratio? It would be if we thought there was just simply a derth of investment opportunities where you simply -- you didn't have a productive use for that cash. Allen, anything you'd like to add?", "Allen L. Leverett", "No, I don't think so, Gale. But you always go through those 3 parts, Jim, that Gale enumerated.", "Gale E. Klappa", "All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we appreciate you taking part in the call today. That concludes our conference call for this afternoon. Again, thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, the famous Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office, and her direct line (414)221-2592. Thanks again, everybody.

A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Elaine, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. It's a whopping 9 degrees at downtown Milwaukee, but we're ready to warm you up as we review our 2013 year end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, our Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.", "Pat, of course, will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $2.51 a share for 2013. This compares with earnings of $2.35 a share in 2012. And I'm pleased to report that 2013, by virtually every meaningful measure, was an exceptional year for Wisconsin Energy. Operationally, we achieved a number of significant milestones. We were named America's most reliable utility. We also earned the best in the Midwest regional reliability award for the ninth time in the past 12 years.", "In early 2013, J.D. Power ranked our company the #1 large utility in the Midwest for customer satisfaction among business customers. And by year end, we attained our highest overall customer satisfaction ratings in the past decade, probably our best ever.", "From a financial standpoint, we continued to deliver solid earnings growth. We generated strong positive cash flow, and we made significant progress toward a dividend payout that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated sector. Of course, a number of factors contributed to our record financial performance in 2013. As always, the weather had an influence on our results. We experienced colder-than-normal weather in the first and fourth quarters of 2013, and the colder winter months more than made up for a return to normal summer temperatures across the Midwest.", "In addition to the weather, the investments in our Power the Future generating units, a strong focus on cost control and our share repurchase program all contributed to our 2013 performance. I might add that our Power the Future investments have provided very significant benefits to our customers over the bitterly cold months of this winter. Sales of our generation over and above the demand from our retail and wholesale customers, otherwise known as sales for resale into the Mid-continent power market, were up 500% in the fourth quarter of 2013 and have continued at high levels throughout the month of January. Our new, efficient coal units performed exceptionally well as the price of natural gas rose in the Midwest, providing more evidence -- more concrete evidence of the benefits of the diversified fleet. I'm going to remind you that the margins on this sales for resale help our customers by reducing our fuel costs, and the capacity helps to keep the lights on and the energy flowing throughout the region.", "Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 6.2% in December and remains well below the national average. In fact, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it's been since 2008. Delivered electric volumes to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, dropped by 2.6% in 2013 but rose by 1.1% in the fourth quarter. We saw strength in several sectors, including paper manufacturing, chemical production, primary metals and transportation equipment. Wisconsin now ranks 17th of the Chief Executive Magazine list of the best states to do business. That's up from 5 years ago when the state was down at a rank of 43rd.", "In addition, we continue to see customer growth across our system. Compared to 2012, new electric service connections were up by 6.4% during 2013, and new natural gas installations rose by more than 15%. This reflects a rebound in the home building market and the volume of customers who are switching from propane to natural gas.", "Now as you may recall from our last update, we were nearing the completion of a major construction project, our biomass-fueled power plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. I'm pleased to report that the plant achieved commercial operation on November 8, on-time and on budget. As I've noted before, the biomass plant helps us to diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. The new unit produces electricity for the grid and provides steam for the Domtar paper mill, and we can dispatch the unit on demand. That's a benefit simply not available with solar or wind generation. Overall, our investment in the biomass plant totaled $269 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Over the past few months, we have also started a new construction project at one of our oldest hydroelectric plants. In October of 2013, we began building a new powerhouse at our Twin Falls hydro site. That's on the border of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula, Michigan. Twin Falls is 1 of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. It was built back in 1912. And while the plant is licensed to operate until 2040, the existing powerhouse is badly in need of repair. We considered several alternatives, but the most prudent course is to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Since our last update, we began site work to prepare for the start of major construction activity, and the major activity is planned for the spring. We expect to complete the project in 2016, with an estimated cost of $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "We're also planning to convert our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. To refresh your memory, the Valley plant is a co-generation facility located along the Menominee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam to heat more than 450 buildings in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our distribution network. We received an air permit for the project in November of '13. And then just last week, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission gave its oral approval of the project, and we should receive a written order, a final written order, very soon. We plan to complete the Valley conversion in late 2015 or early 2016 at an estimated cost of $65 million to $70 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Also, before we begin the conversion, we must upgrade the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. That upgrade began in March of this past year and has an estimated cost of $26 million. Converting Valley over to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.", "Switching gears now. You'll recall that in 2011 our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock. That authorization ran through the end of 2013. So during 2013, we purchased approximately 3,025,000 shares. In total, since the program began, we've repurchased 7,877,000 shares at a cost just over $277.8 million. That equates, ladies and gentlemen, to an average purchase price of $36.19 a share.", "In December, as you may recall, the board approved a new share purchase plan. The new plan authorizes management to purchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy stock from 2014 through 2017. Regarding our dividend policy, last month, our board voted to raise the quarterly dividend of the company's common stock from $0.3825 a share to $0.39 a share. The new annual rate is $1.56 a share. This represents a 30% increase over the dividend rate that was in effect at the end of 2012. The board also reaffirmed the dividend policy that calls for a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a level that will be more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.", "Now I'd like to touch on our growth plan and the investment opportunities that we see unfolding over the next several years. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2014 through 2018. In this 5-year plan, we'd move from the large, very high-profile projects that were part of Power the Future to many smaller scale projects designed to upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. Over this 5-year period, we'll be placing a greater focus on pipes, polls, wires, transformers and substations, the very building blocks of our delivery business. We're rebuilding 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines, replacing 18,500 power polls, 20,000 transformers and literally hundreds and hundreds of substation components.", "On the natural gas side of our business, we're replacing 1,100 miles of gas mains, 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and some 233,000 meter sets. The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory, construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects we have completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as one of the most reliable utilities in the nation.", "And now I'd like to walk through our 10-year capital budget projection to provide you with additional clarity on our longer-term plans. As you can see in the earnings package on our website, over the 10-year period 2014 through 2023, our investment focus will remain on our smaller-scale distribution infrastructure projects. We currently estimate our total capital spend over this period will be in a range of $6.5 billion to $7.1 billion or between $650 million and $710 million a year. During the latter part of the 10-year period, we'll determine whether additional investments will be needed for us to continue meeting Wisconsin's renewable energy standard. We currently project to be in compliance through the year 2022.", "Now it's important to point out that we expect the earnings growth from our 10-year capital investment plan to be supplemented by earnings growth in other areas, such as our 26% ownership of American Transmission Company and earnings growth from using our strong cash flow to fund additional investment opportunities, purchase shares or retire debt. Based on everything we see today, we believe our long-term earnings growth rate will be comparable to the best managed companies in our industry.", "Now I'd like to briefly cover a few details about our near-term investment opportunities. For example, we continue to make progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you may recall, the units initially were permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous and Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal, blending the 2 types of coal could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend. After receiving environmental approvals, we began testing a blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at the plant last May, and the initial tests are promising. We plan to continue testing into 2015 to identify equipment modifications that could be needed to increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal permanently in our fuel mix. If significant modifications are required, we expect to seek approval from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission in late 2014 or early 2015.", "As we look ahead, the investments we're planning on the generation side of our business, converting Valley to natural gas, changing our fuel mix at Oak Creek, are expected to lower cost for customers. The Valley conversion, for example, is projected to save $10 million to $15 million annually in operating costs. As I mentioned, our fuel flexibility efforts at Oak Creek could save customers up to $50 million a year depending on the coal blend.", "On the natural gas side of our business, you may recall that we're planning to build a new natural gas lateral in west-central Wisconsin. We filed an application for approval with the Wisconsin Commission in 2013. A prehearing conference to set the regulatory schedule was held in December. This 85-mile line would run between Eau Claire County in the far Western part of the state in the city of Tomah in Monroe County in west-central Wisconsin. The project will address reliability concerns in Western Wisconsin and meet growing demand. Demand is being driven by 2 factors: customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in that region. I might add that 9 communities along the proposed route have now passed resolutions authorizing us to begin operating natural gas distribution systems within their borders. If we receive timely approval from the Wisconsin Commission, we expect an in-service date during the fourth quarter of 2015. The projected cost is $150 million to $170 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Now as many of you know, and I'm sure there are some chattering teeth out there, this winter has been brutally cold in Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest. If they made a movie about the last couple of months, the title, I think, would be Polar Vortex Meets the Frozen Tundra. But movie or no movie, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers during January than during any other single month in history. And this growth in demand underscores the need to expand our natural gas distribution network in Western Wisconsin.", "We're also following another possible investment opportunity, the potential sale of the State of Wisconsin's electric and steam generating units. Last year, you may recall, Governor Walker signed into the law a new state budget, and that budget includes a provision expanding the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties. This means that the administration now has the authority to pursue the sale of the state's electric steam and chilled water production and distribution facilities. The state is moving forward and, in October, officials began the process of selecting outside financial advisors. No formal timetable has been announced, but if the sale does take place, we expect that it would occur in early 2015.", "And finally, before closing my remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our operations in Michigan. As you'll recall, under Michigan law, retail customers may choose an alternative supplier to provide power supply service. The law limits customer choice to 10% of Michigan's retail sales, but the law excludes from the cap the iron ore mines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The 2 iron ore mines we've been serving on a low margin interruptible tariff switched to an alternative supplier in September of '13. Several smaller customers have switched as well. Of course, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions regardless of the power supplier. We have taken and we'll continue to take multiple steps to address the situation. We filed a request with the mid-continent grid operator to suspend the operations of all 5 of our units in the Upper Peninsula. That's at the Presque Isle Power Plant. In October of last year, MISO determined that all the units are still required to maintain reliability in Northern Michigan. As a result, we are eligible for system support resource payments from MISO to recover the costs that we incurred to operate the units.", "Since our last update, we have now finalized system support resource agreement with MISO. Under the agreement, MISO will pay us an availability fee to ensure the units are maintained and available to run and a fee to cover our costs when the units are actually operating. MISO recently filed this agreement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And following FERC approval, we expect to receive payments retroactive to February 1 2014. Although the long-term impact of the Michigan choice law is still uncertain, we expect that successful mitigation efforts on our part and a reasonable regulatory response should make our net financial exposure immaterial.", "That said, given the loss of load in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, we are reevaluating our supply portfolio. Before the departure of the mines, we had a long-term need for at least a portion of the Presque Isle plant. At this point, we do not have such a need. As you may recall, we were working with Wolverine Power Cooperative, a power coop in Michigan, to determine if we could modify the structure of our joint venture to address the new circumstances. However, we were not able to find an alternative that would work for both Wolverine and for our customers. As a result in December, we agreed to terminate the joint venture. We'll continue to review the long-term options for the plant, including its potential sale.", "In summary, ladies and gentlemen, we enter 2014 in excellent condition. The company is performing at a high level, both operationally and financially. Our Power the Future investments are providing very significant and tangible benefits for our customers and stockholders, and we'll continue to focus on renewing and upgrading our distribution network as we deliver the future.", "And now with more details on our full year performance and our outlook for 2014, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2013, our earnings rose to $2.51 a share, compared with $2.35 a share for 2012. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2013 was $1,080,000,000 as compared to $1 billion even in 2012. That's an increase of $80 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in 2013 totaled $719.4 million, an increase of $71.7 million over 2012. On the positive side, we estimate the cold winter weather increased our margins by $82.3 million. 2013 was unusually cold in the first and fourth quarters and, in 2012, we experienced a very mild first quarter.", "Pricing increases for our Wisconsin retail customers net of amortizations also helped by $57.8 million. Conversely, we estimate that the return to normal summer weather in the second and third quarters reduced our margins by $35.9 million when compared to the unusually hot summer of 2012. In addition, depreciation expense increased by $23.8 million, with the additional capital investment placed in service during 2012.", "In December of 2013, we filed a request with the federal government for a treasury grant related to our newly completed biomass plant. The grant was neutral to our net income because our Wisconsin retail customers received bill credits during the year. As discussed in prior calls, the grant did boost our fourth quarter income.", "Now turning to our non-utility segment. Operating income was up $8.3 million when compared to last year because of the final approval of our Power the Future plant costs in the last Wisconsin rate case. Taking the changes for these 2 segments together and a slight decrease at corporate and other, you arrive at the $80 million increase in operating income.", "During 2013, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled nearly $69 million, up almost $3 million from 2012. These earnings were in line with our expectations. Our other income, net declined by $16 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased because we completed the final stages of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units in 2012.", "Our net interest expense increased by $3.9 million. This was primarily driven by lower capitalized interests as we had fewer construction projects underway in 2013. Our consolidated income tax expense rose by $31.6 million because of higher pretax earnings and a slightly higher effective tax rate. The higher effective tax rate was driven primarily by lower tax benefits and lower equity AFUDC which are permanent differences for income tax purposes. Our effective tax rate for 2013 was 36.9%, compared to 35.9% in 2012. We estimate that our effective tax rate in 2014 will be 37.5% to 38.5%.", "Combining all of these items brings you to $577.4 million of debt income for the year. Including $0.03 for the cumulative effect of our share repurchases, we earned $2.51 per share. During 2013, our adjusted operating cash flows totaled $1,234,000,000, which is a $17 million increase from 2012. The increase came partly from higher net income and the fact that no contributions to our benefit plans were required in 2013 compared to $100 million contribution made in 2012. Partially offsetting these items was an increase in working capital.", "Our capital expenditures totaled $687.4 million in 2013, a $19.6 million decrease compared to 2012. We saw lower expenditures because construction on the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units was completed in 2012. This was partially offset by additional capital expenditures related to the biomass project.", "We also paid $328.9 million in common dividends in 2013 which was $52.6 million greater than in 2012. And as Gale mentioned earlier, in January, the board increased our quarterly dividend to $0.39 per share, which raised the annual dividend rate to $1.56 per share.", "We are also pleased that our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.5% at the end of 2013 which is lower than our 2012 ratio of 53.2%. We expect 2014 will be in line with 2013. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. So that going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "As Gale mentioned earlier, delivered electric volumes to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, dropped by 2.6% in 2013 but rose 1.1% in the fourth quarter. Delivered electricity reflects the demand from both our retail and electric choice customers and thus, is a good indicator of how the regional economy is faring. But consistent with past practice, I will also report on traditional sales to our retail customers. These sales statistics include both supply and distribution service. As shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales electricity, excluding the mines, declined by 1.6% during 2013 as compared to 2012. Weather-normalized sales were down 0.7%.", "Looking at the individual customers segments, we saw actual residential sales decrease by 2.1% in 2013. On a normalized basis, residential sales declined by 3/10 of 1%. Across our small commercial industrial group, actual annual sales were flat with 2012 levels. And on a weather-normalized basis, full year sales to this group were down by 3/10 of 1%. Sales to the large commercial industrial segment for the full year 2013, excluding the iron ore mines, were down 3% for the year but were stronger in the latter half of the year.", "Overall, for 2014, we're forecasting a 1/10 of 1% decrease in weather-normalized sales, again, excluding the iron ore mines. We expect residential sales to grow 4/10 of 1%, impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts offset by conservation.", "In the small commercial industrial segment, we are projecting a slight increase of 1/10 of 1%. And in the large commercial industrial group, we are projecting a decrease of 8/10 of 1%. On the other hand, if we look at delivered electric volumes, we're projecting a 1/2 of 1% increase.", "On the natural gas side of the business, total volumes in 2013 increased by 9.9%, primarily due to colder weather. On a normalized basis, and excluding the volumes used in power generation, gas volumes increased by 2.4% compared to 2012. This is attributed to an increase in customers, the old switching to natural gas and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry.", "Looking over the period 2014 through 2018, we're projecting positive free cash flow totaling $500 million. As a reminder, we define free cash flow as the cash available after capital spending and dividends.", "Next, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance for 2014. As we've discussed, our earnings in 2013 were $2.51 a share. Subtracting $0.09 for favorable weather and then adding back increased O&M spending partly related to the weather, we estimate that normalized earnings for 2013 were $2.48 a share. Taking this into account, we expect our earnings for 2014 to be in a range of $2.53 a share to $2.63 a share. Our 2014 earnings projection assumes normal weather. And again, our guidance for 2014 is $2.53 a share to $2.63 a share. And finally, as we look ahead and taking into account our cold January weather, we expect our first quarter 2014 earnings to be in a range of $0.79 to $0.81 a share.", "And with that, I'll turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "I'm confused. So the question is, you indicated that your 4% to 6% targeted growth rate, you -- that's was your historical growth. And today, you said you want to be amongst the best managed companies in terms of growth going forward. So what do I make of that statement? It was very wide open.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay. Well, let me walk you through our thinking. First of all, as you know, we -- as promised, we published today for all of you a 10-year capital spending plan to give everyone a little bit better clarity on the investment opportunities that we see, particularly in our retail utilities going forward. When we look at those investment opportunities, which are real, when we look at several other opportunities -- investment opportunities that may or may not come to pass but we're working on, when you factor in the growth from American Transmission Company and factor in potential uses of our strong cash flow, as I say, we have no reason today to change our long-term earnings growth forecast and I personally think that, that forecast will place us among the best managed, best growing companies in the industry.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay, super. Second question is, with this revised 10-year CapEx plan, you talked about depreciation now being in the range of, I think, $425 million a year or so on average versus $375 million previously. What does that do to rate base growth, and could you all talk about how that depreciation plays out and what your rate base growth forecasts are?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, if you -- I think a pretty simple way to look at that is if you start with where we are today, where our utility rate base, is about $6.6 billion at the end of 2013. We're projecting out to grow to $7.1 billion of rate base by the end of '15. And then you can just do the math in terms of looking at that lifesaver chart we have for 10 years, and then taking the $425 million of average depreciation. So you can see what the utility -- the basic utility rate base growth looks like in terms of capital investment above the rate of depreciation.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and then just one last question. Can you talk a little bit about deferred taxes and what you expect going forward?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure, we'll be happy to do that. Pat and Steve have all the information on deferred taxes going forward.", "Stephen P. Dickson", "Yes, I think -- this is Steve Dickson. In the past, we had said that because of bonus depreciation, because of the PLR on Road, we had significant tax deductions which created significant deferred taxes, and cash taxes were low this year. And we expect to have NOLs going into 2014, which will reduce tax carry for -- or reduced cash taxes in 2014 and also into 2015. And we will have, when we file the 10-K, the detailed schedules of our NOL carryforwards and long-term deferred tax items.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I'm still confused a little bit, Gale. So I want to go back to the first question, if you guys don't mind and then I'll turn it over to somebody else. So when you're talking about this growth rate, I guess the first question is, who are you comping yourselves against? How does that growth rate accelerate going forward, and where might you be conservative on that growth rate guidance?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I would look at it more who's copying us, Jim, but then I'm biased. I mean, clearly, we think we can deliver the best customer value and best shareholder value by focusing our investments on our core business. So point number one, which you've heard me reiterate time and time again is, we do not intend to diversify into unregulated businesses or to golf courses in Mexico. I mean, we're going to focus on our knitting. We're going to excel at managing investment projects and bringing them in for customers on-time and on budget. We're going to continue to try to be the most reliable utility in the nation, and that's our basic strategy. And from that strategy, we believe, at the moment, that our medium-term growth rate is 4% to 6%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC Financial.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "So to follow a little bit on Jim's line of questioning about the growth rate, what are you expecting out of ATC? If you look out 5 or 10 years, what do you think is reasonable to think when it translates into Wisconsin Energy earnings, how much of a growth rate there can be there?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, Allen, who's on the ATC board will give you the answer to that question. Just to frame it, though, through the past several years, the growth rate of ATC has been very supportive of our corporate-wide 4% to 6% growth rate. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes, Kit, this is Allen. I guess when you look at ATC, their projected rate base this year -- so 2014, their projected rate base is about $3 billion. And if you look at their 10-year capital spending plan solely for their traditional footprint, so their traditional service territory, if you will, in Wisconsin as well as in Michigan, they're projecting somewhere between $3 billion and $3.6 billion worth of capital over the next 10 years. So if you superimposed $3 billion to $3.6 billion on top of $3 billion of the current rate base, I mean, that gets you really to the mid to the upper end really of a 4% to 6%. So it's very, very supportive, meaning, net income growth rate. So it's very supportive of our Wisconsin Energy target. And then -- and although we're not including anything, Kit, over the next 3 years for additional net income contribution from projects outside of ATC's footprint, to the extent they can do some things outside their footprint, that will just go on top of really inside their footprint growth rate that's already supportive of 4% to 6%. Hopefully, that's responsive to your question.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, absolutely. So if they do find -- or even adding that amount of rate base and especially if they go outside the footprint to find new projects, does that require additional equity contributions from you guys?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, the internal cash flow at ATC is very, very strong. So for the stuff inside the footprint, Kit, I would expect fairly minimal capital contributions being required. Now if they kill something and bring it back to the cave from outside the footprint, those -- some of those are pretty significant investments, and that would require some capital contributions from us as well as the other owners.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Right. Okay, fair enough. Good, I appreciate that. And one other area I'd like to just touch on for a second. When -- Pat, I think you were talking about sales growth. Those numbers you gave were for your 2014 estimate of sales growth. Is that correct?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes, Kit, that's correct. The -- I mean, I kind of walked through the deltas for '13 and then moved on to '14. So I'll just clip through them real quick. So overall, it was 0.1% decrease of normalized sales, so basically flat. With residential, up about 4/10; small commercial, down -- excuse me, up about a 1/10; and then the large C&I, down about 8/10.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "And how about if you took a view of, say, 5 years? What would your growth rates look like?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes. I think we've kind of said over a 5-year horizon. We're looking at a long-term flattish to maybe 0.5%. Again, that's on the electric side.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Right. And how about on the gas side? I assume that's more robust.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Well, the gas side, yes, it's been interesting. I mean, if you look back from 2011 to 2012, normalized gas, we grew 1.3%-ish, and we're 2.4% 2012 to 2013, so I still don't trust our normalization completely. I mean, it was real warm here in 2012 and really cold last year. But if you look at -- since 1970s, say, that's been clear use for customers than on a steady decline. I think it's -- at minimum, we've leveled off, and you could probably make an argument that it may be creeping back.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And I would guess, to Pat's point, that the growth rate in individual customer use of natural gas, going forward, is going to depend upon whether or not gas prices stay in a reasonable and relatively stable zone, so we will see. But clearly, I think Pat is right. The outlook, in terms of growth in natural gas consumption, is stronger right now going forward than what I hope is a conservative assumption on our part on the electric side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "My question was answered, but thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Can you quantify -- since it's a public filing, meaning it's at the FERC, the data should be available. Can you quantify the MISO payments and how long you expect to receive that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sure, I'll ask Allen to quantify. There are 3 pieces to the MISO payments, and I will say upfront that under the MISO protocol, these agreements are for 12-month periods with renewal potential after each 12-month period. So 3 pieces to the MISO payments that have been filed. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes. And I guess maybe just to simplify, maybe just talk about it, and the 2 components that Gale talked about. But yes, there is a fixed component, Michael, which for a 12-month period, the fixed component would be approximately $52 million. And then, as Gale mentioned, when they dispatch the units, they would pay us essentially whatever the variable cost of operation is. So $52 million of 6 payments over a 12-month period, so 12 monthly payments, and then a variable component based on the operating costs. And Michael, the operating costs of the unit is on the order of $30 a megawatt hour, approximately.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "How should we think about that? And I'm thinking about it from a bridge, from 2013 to 2014, to think about what of the $52 million. Let's just say, on hypothetical, it never dispatched, so we're just doing fixed cost recovery. How we should -- how should investors think about what the impact of that is year-over-year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Maybe, Michael, we could step back a second and take that little bit different hypothetical because that -- those units are dispatched virtually all the time. At least [indiscernible] units are dispatched virtually all the time. So I'm not sure starting at a point where they don't get dispatched is particularly helpful. Maybe the best way to look at it is that iron ore mines switched supplier September 1. The cost to us, without any reimbursement whatsoever from MISO as we just continued to dispatch the units and basically, covering our fuel costs, the cost was about $0.01 a month, $0.01 a share or about roughly $4 million a month.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes. So Michael, as you step back, of course, 4 times 12 is 48. I mean, you -- the $52 million and the $40 million M&Ls offset each other.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Right. So are you basically saying that the bottom line impact of this is pretty much negligible for you, or is there actually a little bit of an uptick from this because you lost the $0.04 -- the $0.01 a month from September to December? And you would get that $0.04 back effectively but not incremental?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We do not get the $0.04 back from September through December, nor will we get compensated other than what we get on the hourly market in January. Remember, these payments are effective assuming FERC approval February 1. So I think we're all kind of looking at each other. I don't see any real uptick here. It's about awash.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes. Because you get 11 months of the fixed payments, Michael, and then we talked about the $4 million a month loss from the mines.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, okay. I'll follow up with Pat offline on this one. Allen, one question on ATC. We've talked over the years multiple times about whether alternative ownership structures for ATC make sense. And one of the things -- given just where other pure play and there's only 1 or 2 transmission companies or even pipeline companies we trade, one of the things I don't know if we've talked about is whether an alternative structure similar to like a REIT-like structure for ATC would be value enhancing or value destroying for Wisconsin Energy and some of the other companies who own it.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes. Well, I did not know that electric transmission, I don't know if this a verb, but is REIT-able. Whether you could put that into a REIT or in some sort of master-limited partnership. So I wasn't aware that you could put electric transmission in that kind of structure, so I can't really comment on that in detail, Michael. But as I step back, I mean, in terms of ownership structure, I mean, we and the other owners, I mean, we certainly have the cash flow to fund the growth. And as I mentioned, in response to Kit's question earlier, it's quite accretive to our growth rates from our retail business. So we still think it fits, and it fits pretty well in terms of the current ownership structure.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, last question. Gale, expectations for the rate case this year and just kind of what may be some pushback from intervenors could be? I know it's early.", "Gale E. Klappa", "It's very early. As everyone probably knows, Wisconsin is on a 2-year cycle, so this would be our normal bi-annual case. We would expect to file it in the spring, and we're putting together all the details as we speak. But I would suspect that the rate request will be very modest. And in addition to that, given the very strong performance of our generating units in the MISO market during the past year, I would expect that, that rate request will also include a fuel refund to customers.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it, so almost a negligible impact for the customer?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I wouldn't say negligible, but very modest.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "I just had one detail question. Your projected consumption expectations for '14, you said $0.8 down on large C&I, but then there was a follow-up comment, some offsetting which would be up 0.5%? I missed that commentary.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes. What we're trying to do is kind of break out 2 things for the first time because we have now experienced, in Michigan, some customers moving to alternative suppliers. So what we're trying to do is report traditionally the way we have reported, and the 0.5% up that you're asking about is on total delivered volumes. So whether they're our supply customer or not, we still provide distribution and customer service functions to those customers. So we wanted to show you kind of from an economic standpoint or a broader economy standpoint what the world kind of looks like to us, and we're projecting 0.5% weather normal growth in delivered volumes. Then the other statistics that Pat walked through in terms of large commercial and industrial, small commercial and industrial and residential, where we're projecting a slight decrease, those are the way we would traditionally have reported both supply and distribution customer sales. Am I making any sense to you, Paul?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "The megawatt-hours delivered will exceed megawatt-hours generated to certain large C&I? You'll still deliver, but someone will also generate it?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is correct. And if you look at it that way, megawatt-hours delivered will exceed megawatt-hours generated except a lot of those megawatt-hours are coming from our Presque Isle plant. So...", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Intermediary in there somewhere?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Intermediary, that's a very, very good way to look at it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Judge with Atlantic Equities.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP", "Just a couple of things on -- questions on your capital spending. When looking at your delivery gas expectations, you just made a bunch of comments about how things are -- well, first of all, it's very cold; and then second, you've had a lot of talents along the route of your new pipeline sign up for an LDC agreement. And you also have talked in the past about the success of frac-ing. I'm just wondering, first of all, number one, is there an opportunity to upsize that investments? And number two, I don't think I see anything out for us that could phase even though it seems like there are some higher growth rate coming through from delivery. Just -- could you talk through that and give me some perspective on that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, I'd be happy to. The application we've made, Nathan, as you know, for approval for an 85-mile extension of our natural gas distribution network in the Western part of the state, that application -- depending upon how the factors in terms of customer demand continue to shake out, if approved, that application could be the first phase, if you will. And we're talking in Phase I here of this 85-mile line at a $150 million to $170 million investment. I would hope that we would receive approval from the Wisconsin Commission midyear this year to begin work later in the year. And I will tell you, what we experienced in the western part of the state over the course of January has done nothing but underscore the need, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, for this extension. We saw a Canadian -- TransCanada pipeline explode a couple of weekends ago in Canada, near Winnipeg. And that affected the flow of gas off the major pipelines into the Dakotas, Minnesota and the western part of Wisconsin. Luckily, we were able to work our way through that without customer interruption. But when that happened, the windshields were in the minus 40- and minus 50-degree area. So you're talking about life and death kind of circumstances. And as I say, the experience of this past month has done nothing but underscore the need. So we're optimistic that we will get approval in a timely way from the Wisconsin Commission. And then depending upon future demand growth, as I mentioned, that could be -- this $150 million to $170 million project could be the first of 2 phases. But we'll take it one step at a time, and we hope to have -- we hope to be able to begin construction and have this first phase in place by late '15 or early '16. Does that respond to your question, Nathan?", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP", "It does. Just trying to see if the $150 million could be perhaps upside in the near-term, given what seems to be a very favorable backdrop.", "Gale E. Klappa", "I mean, it's certainly possible, but I wouldn't expect that for 2015 or 2016. Maybe later in 2016 or 2017.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP", "And just a little bit on the fuel blending. I believe, if I recall correctly, that you were thinking about perhaps making a filing with the commission about possible investments in 2014, and it now sounds like you're looking at 2015. Has there been a change there, and what -- on the margins, what's going on?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No real change. We've been always saying that we want to be deliberate with our testing to make sure there's no degradation of the units and to be certain of what equipment modifications really might be needed for the long term. And our plan had always been to file for anything we might need in terms of commission approval related to the fuel blending in late '14 or early '15, so that is absolutely on track, Nathan.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP", "Okay, I missed this. So in the late '14 -- sorry. And then just going to the renewables post 2020, which is I know quite a ways away, but I wasn't clear. And your 10-year capital plan, if you've got the renewables at $250 million to $450 million, is that an additional amount on top of your $650 million to $670 million roundabout between in '21 to '23?", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are absolutely correct, Nathan. That, if it comes to pass, would be additional on top of all the bars and all the spending that you see on that page. So it would be on top of the roughly $650 million to $670 million a year.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP", "Great. And then just finally, if you could walk us through the sale of -- potential sale of a plant. You mentioned that in your commentary, but it sounds like now something will happen in 2015. Just -- if you could just walk us, just kind of give us an update.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I think the state continues to progress forward in its thinking, and our expectation is that they are in the final stage of determining which financial advisors they would like to hire. They put out an RFP for financial advisors in the fall. I know they have interviewed financial advisors, and my sense is that, in the next month or 2, they may choose their financial advisor, and then the financial advisor would help them organize the effort going forward. And that's why we're saying if the sale of state-owned assets takes place, it probably would occur, our guess would be, in 2015.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP", "And would -- could those plants -- a lot of those plants need to run given the steam properties of the steam generation heating properties. Obviously, a lot of those plants are -- require capital investment for CapEx or for environmental ratings. Is that in your budget at all, or how would that play out as we look kind of 2017 and beyond?", "Gale E. Klappa", "It's a very good question, Nathan. And the direct answer is that would be investment upside. We have not assumed anything in the terms of capital spending for state-owned power plants. It would be an investment upside for us.", "Nathan Judge - Atlantic Equities LLP", "Could you give us an idea about the amount -- the plant, what kind of investment would be required for capital on environmental?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Nathan, because the state is not really at a point where any due diligence is -- has been allowed, we have, in our minds, put a placeholder, but it's simply a guesstimate, and we're guesting $250 million perhaps for an initial capital outlay to purchase the plants. But that's just simply a guesstimate at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Dan Jenkins", "I just have a couple of clarification questions and then a couple of others beyond that. But I think you'd mentioned you expect $500 million of free cash flow when you're calculating that after subtracting CapEx and dividends for 2014. Did I get that right?", "James Patrick Keyes", "2014 through 2018, Dan. It's over the 5 years.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. So what does 85 million -- or 85-mile pipeline for the gas line that you're talking about, is that reflective? Is that what's the boost is on your last slide there for the 2015 gas delivery? Is that in the $330 million? Is that what's causing kind of the jump up?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes. When you see that gas delivery bar increase, that is exactly right. That would reflect the big lump of capital spending that would be required to make progress on that project in that year.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then I was curious on that same slide, just to kind of to clarify. You showed 2013, that's a different amount than what you're showing on Page 5 on your cash flow statement. There, you're showing $687 million. I was wondering what the difference was there.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes. Dan, this is Pat. The difference on the -- what Allen affectionally calls the lifesaver chart, that $668 million is only in the utilities, and what you're looking on the cash flow statement would include Power the Future. That's the difference.", "Dan Jenkins", "So then -- companywide then, it could potentially be a little higher than this, than you're showing on the slide?", "Gale E. Klappa", "The numbers you're seeing in what we call the lifesaver chart, with the bars breaking down basically customer service generation, delivery and renewables, those bars reflect the spending that we expect in our retail utilities only. So there are additional investments that are planned, obviously, for our maintenance capital for the Power the Future units. We have a little bit of capital for some of the other business lines. But what we wanted to show you was the rate base growth that we see going forward here over the -- our best guesstimate over the course of the next 10 years. Does that respond to your question?", "Dan Jenkins", "Sure. So that would be incremental to the Slide 13?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is absolutely correct.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. Going back to this, you mentioned on this pipeline that it would potentially -- that it would pass 9 communities that would potentially be interested in hooking on the gas service...", "Gale E. Klappa", "Dan, do you have a cabin out there or something?", "Dan Jenkins", "No, not yet, but I might. It sounds like it might be a good plan, but...", "Gale E. Klappa", "You pay, we'll hook you up.", "Dan Jenkins", "I was just curious what the potential -- like what's the population in that as far so we can get a sense for the potential growth.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, the -- these are -- as you know, Western Wisconsin is quite rural, so these are small communities, a couple of thousand people per community. But the real demand out there is really coming, as I mentioned, from 2 areas; One, potential customer growth from these communities; but secondly, overall demand growth. Propane is widely used, particularly by farmers and other businesses in that section of the state. So conversions from propane and then, of course, the tremendous growth of the sand mining industry. We've gone from something in the neighborhood of 10 sand mining and sand processing operations in 2010 to over 100 sand mining operations. Actually, Pat is saying it's a 115 licensed sand mining operations last year, and these sand mining operations have to drive the sand before it is shipped. And their preferred method for drying sand is very large natural gas-fueled dryers. So you're seeing sand mine -- you're seeing requests from sand mining operations for us to supply gas to their operations. We're seeing customers wanting to switch from propane. And you know, Dan, as you follow the news, there have been shortages of propane in more than 24 states. And the price of propane, if you can get it, particularly in Western Wisconsin, is just incredible. So we would expect the demand from customers wanting to switch to propane, we would expect that momentum to continue to grow even from where we've seen it over the past couple of years.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then I was just curious as far as your financing plan for '14. I know you have $300 million maturing, coming up here in April 1. I expect you plan to refinance that. And is there any additional debt that you would need to issue this year?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We'll let Pat handle that question for you.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Sure, Dan. Yes, you're right. We've got that 6% coupon, $300 million coming due late March, April. That one will be replaced late Q1, early Q2. Probably about $250 million is what we're forecasting right now. And then, we've also got -- you may recall that in 2013, at Wisconsin Gas, we had a $45 million bond retired. We've not replaced that. We didn't replace that last year, but we will -- forecasting we'll replace that this year probably. So I would say Q2, Q3, maybe $100 million at Wisconsin Gas.", "Dan Jenkins", "Okay. And then just the last, you mentioned fourth quarter that you did see some pickup x the mine. Should it see some pickup in your large industrial customers?", "Gale E. Klappa", "That is correct.", "Dan Jenkins", "Do you anticipate that to continue, or is that maybe a reflection of onetime items? Or how should we think about the economic growth going forward?", "Gale E. Klappa", "What I can tell you, because we -- I personally look at this data every week. What I can tell you is that through January, now it's been cold, obviously. And so there is some bit of -- some small amount of weather sensitivity, even with the large industrials. But if you take a look at the 17 industrial customer segments where we have significant customer presence and where we serve, we serve industrial customers in 17 different segments of the economy. Through January, 9 of those 17 segments continued to show growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Actually, my questions have been answered.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischoff with Morningstar.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "When you look at 5-year growth expectations for load growth of half -- of flat to 0.5%, is that consistent across residential, industrial and commercial, or is there some variation there?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, there is some variation. I mean, again, given the fact that in total retail, we're only projecting 0.5% growth. The variation is not huge, but there is some modest variation. It's got, I think -- we're probably projecting a little stronger growth in small commercial and industrial than in a large.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes, a little bit stronger in the small.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes. So the only -- it's pretty even except a little bit stronger growth in small commercial and industrial than in large.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti from CDP Capital.", "Vedula Murti", "Couple of a separate things. One, you talked about the cash flow profile to 5 years through 2018. I don't -- I apologize, I don't have the slides in front of me, but does the cash flow profile in terms of free cash flow generation changed much in the outer years given that you have a 10-year CapEx plan?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We'd certainly been very thorough about running our models through the next 5 and, as Pat mentioned, our cumulative total free cash flow for '14 through '18 is approximately $500 million. I can tell you that, based on what we're seeing further out -- and again a lot of assumptions have to go into the further out, your capital spending, your returns, the growth -- in none of those periods that we turned negative cash.", "Vedula Murti", "You did turn negative cash?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We do not turn negative. Not turn negative. We see positive free cash throughout the entire period.", "Vedula Murti", "Okay. And my second question is more industry. There's been a lot of press lately in terms of cyber threats to the grid and other types of risks to the system. One, I'm wondering kind of in terms of what type of capital expenditures or other things are you seeing, that the industry is seeing? And also tying to that, is there anything going on with regards to coming up with something to kind of mirror, like Price-Anderson, like in terms of risks associated with the nuclear accident, if something were to significantly happen to a part of the grid or to specific -- to a particular operating system?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, to your second question, Vedula, I don't see anything on the horizon related to the distribution networks across the country or the grids across the country. I don't see anything on the horizon that would even resemble Price-Anderson, nothing like that. That may not be a bad idea, but I don't see anything quite like that at all. And then in terms of investments that we're making related to cybersecurity, the answer is yes. We are making investments related to cybersecurity, relating to protecting our networks. I would be a little reluctant to get into the specifics of those investments. But particularly on the gas distribution side of the business, I think over the course of 5, 10 years from now, over the second half of the 5-year period, you will see an increasing amount of capital spend on just security for the gas distribution networks as new pipeline safety rules come into effect. But yes, there are ongoing investments, things that we are doing, both physical security and protection from cybersecurity.", "Vedula Murti", "I mean, is that going to be like in the -- just in like the tens and millions of dollars annually or could they end up being more material?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Right now, it is not the lion's share anywhere close to out of our capital budget, but I would say -- my own personal belief is that as we work out 3, 5 and 10 years, that type of investment will become more and more material.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Leon Dubov with Luminus Management.", "Leon Dubov", "A couple of quick clarifications. One thing, I think Pat said, when asked about ATC, is that isn't not assuming anything outside the footprint for the next 3 years. I'm just wondering sort of more than 3 years out, are you thinking that we may see something?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, that was the older less handsome version of Pat. That was Allen, and we'll [indiscernible].", "Allen L. Leverett", "We're often confused. The 3 years out, you're exactly right. We've not made any assumptions that ATC would make any additional investments outside the footprint. But I can tell you, certainly, past those 3 years, I mean, ATC is very actively pursuing projects. But at this point, we're just being very conservative about how we put our projections together, and we're not assuming that they get any of those projects. But I've seen, certainly, stuff that they're pursuing that's upwards of $4 billion worth of capital investment. So I would hope that they would get some of those projects. But at this point, we haven't included them in our financial forecast.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And when Allen said that they got something and bring it back to the cave, I'm assuming we'd have to heat the cave.", "Leon Dubov", "And then one other thing. If -- in the new CapEx projections, in '15, the generation proportion went up by I think $55 million or so. Is that the Oak Creek fuel stuff, or is that something different?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We're looking at our chart here.", "Leon Dubov", "I think it used to be $102 million in your last presentation, now it's $157 million.", "Gale E. Klappa", "I guess that's largely timing.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes. Everybody is saying -- everybody is agreeing. That's largely timing from the year-to-year as we've refined our forecast going out.", "Leon Dubov", "Yes, okay. So is the Oak Creek fuel blending in this forecast at all or...", "Gale E. Klappa", "Very small amount, roughly $25 million worth.", "Leon Dubov", "In what year?", "Allen L. Leverett", "It should be in 2015, I would imagine.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, but not a huge amount.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Serena Dackey with UBS.", "Michael Weinstein", "Actually, this is Mike Weinstein. The renewable investments in 2021 to '23, is that just driven by RPS standards? Is that what you're...", "Gale E. Klappa", "Let me explain, and then Allen can add on anything he would like as well. The Wisconsin renewable energy standard requires statewide that 10% of retail sales come from renewables by the year 2015, but then that 10% stays in place. So if you have any load growth at all, you have to add increments of renewables to maintain your compliance with the law and with the standard. So as we -- if you think about how we've complied with the standard so far, we have built the 2 largest wind farms in Wisconsin. We have just finished, as I mentioned, on-time and on budget a significant investment in a biomass plant, and we've supplemented those investments with renewable energy credits. So as we look further out, and Allen you and I decided with Pat, that it wasn't prudent to just simply assume that we could continue to add increments with very low cost renewable energy credits that far out. So we need to start looking 2022 as the latest year we would be in compliance under our current projections for growth. We need to start looking down the road at what other potential renewable investments might work for our portfolio. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes. And that's, obviously, just a placeholder at this point, Mike. And I would expect that renewable technologies will -- they've changed a lot in the last 10 years, and I'm sure they'll continue to change over the next 10 years. So it's really just a placeholder at this point, but it's an indication that, at some point, we're going to need some additional renewable capacity in order to stay in compliance with the state portfolio standard.", "Michael Weinstein", "So up through that time, you're meeting it with renewable credits?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, really a combination. Gale mentioned the fixed investments that we made, so the biomass, the 2 large wind farms and some other smaller renewable investments. So we have that, plus we've been buying some renewable energy credits. So really, it's a combination of those 2, Mike.", "Michael Weinstein", "Is there any chance that you could pull that back and do it a little earlier or...", "Gale E. Klappa", "That depends upon load growth. I mean, if we -- if our load growth projections are conservative and renewable energy credits diminish in terms of their -- either their availability or their cost, then yes. But right now, that's our best guesstimate in terms of timing.", "All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating.

Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's conference call to review 2014 first quarter earnings call. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions] Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language.", "All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.", "During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers.", "In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.", "Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.76 a share for last year's first quarter. The results were much stronger during the first 3 months of this year, primarily because of the extreme winter weather that gripped our service area. In fact, we delivered more natural gas to our customers during the first quarter of 2014 than during any other quarter in history. We exceeded the previous record for gas deliveries set in the first quarter of 2008 by more than 11%.", "On the generation side of our business, our newest coal units, the expansion units at our Oak Creek site, performed exceptionally well. And total sales of power from our generating fleet, over and above the demand from our retail and wholesale customers, were up more than 157% in the first quarter. The margin on these sales helps our customers by reducing our fuel costs, and the capacity helps to keep the lights on and energy flowing throughout the region.", "Now as all of you know, the price of natural gas in the Midwest spiked pretty significantly during the first quarter. We estimate that our new generating units saved our customers more than $42 million in fuel costs this quarter because the units ran on coal as compared to natural gas. Ladies and gentlemen, this is another compelling example of the value of fuel diversity.", "Our distribution network also performed very well during the harshest winter conditions that we've seen in more than 30 years. And as we saw, our deliver the future program provides some early dividends for our customers. As part of deliver the future, we accelerated the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines on our network. These are the very lines that are the most susceptible to problems and leaks, given severe cold weather.", "Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.9% in March and remains well below the national average. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it's been since 2008. With a bit brighter economic backdrop, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by 1.6% in the first quarter. We saw strength in several sectors, including paper manufacturing, food processing, rubber and plastics and chemical production.", "In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are currently up 4.4%, and new natural gas installations are up by more than 7%. This reflects a rebound in home building in our region and the volume of customers who are switching from propane to natural gas.", "Next, I'd like to update you on 2 of our larger construction projects that we have underway. First, you'll recall that we're planning to convert the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menominee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley, of course, generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network.", "I'm pleased to report that we received final approval from the Wisconsin Commission in March, and we've issued a full notice to proceed to our general contractor. We plan to complete the conversion of 2 boilers at the Valley plant in 2014 and the remaining 2 boilers in 2015. We're projecting the costs to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "You may recall that in March of last year, we also began a major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. This pipeline replacement project has an estimated cost of $26 million and is on time and on budget.", "Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.", "Next, I'd like to touch on the work we have underway to upgrade our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. In October of last year, we began building a new powerhouse at the Twin Falls site on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. It was built back in 1912. It's licensed to operate until the year 2040, but the existing powerhouse badly needs repair. We considered several alternatives but the most prudent course is to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity that meets current federal standards. Since our last update, engineering and preconstruction activities have begun and major construction activity will begin in the next few weeks.", "Work to excavate rock and build cofferdams is scheduled for completion this year. We expect the new powerhouse will then be operational in 2015 and the existing powerhouse to be removed in 2016.", "The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Switching gears now. Our board, as you may recall, has authorized us to repurchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock from 2014 through 2017. This is the second phase of our repurchase program. You may recall that our board had previously authorized the purchase of up to $300 million of common stock from 2011 through 2013. So in the first quarter of this year, we purchased approximately 426,000 shares. In total, since our buyback program began, we've repurchased 8,103,000 shares at a cost of $296.4 million. This equates to an average purchase price of $36.58 a share.", "And as we've previously announced, our board has adopted a dividend policy that trends to a 65% to 70% payout ratio in 2017. This policy should support annual dividend increases of 7% to 8% from 2015 to 2017, as we move to a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.", "In January, our board raised the quarterly dividend to $0.39 a share, an increase of 30% over the dividend that was paid during 2012. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.56 a share.", "Next, I'd like to discuss the investment opportunities that we see in our core business as we focus on delivering the future. As we previously reported, our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2014 through 2018. In this 5-year budget, the nature of our capital investments is shifting away from the higher-profile projects such as our Power the Future units, renewable generation and larger quality controls. Instead, our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. For the next 5 years, we will focus on pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations, the building blocks of our delivery business.", "Between now and the end of '18, we plan to rebuild 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines that are today more than 50 years old. We also intend to replace 18,500 power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally hundreds of substation components.", "On the natural gas side of our business, we plan to replace 1,100 miles of vintage plastic and steel gas mains, as well as 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and approximately 233,000 meter sets.", "Of course, the primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable, given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as one of the most reliable utilities in America.", "So we'll keep you posted as these needed infrastructure upgrades move forward.", "We're also making excellent progress, I'm pleased to report, on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted, you may recall, to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of coal could save our customers $25 million to $50 million a year in fuel cost, depending on the mix. In May of last year, we received all the environmental approvals we need and began testing a blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at the plant. Test results continue to be promising. Further testing is scheduled to identify equipment modifications that could be needed to permanently increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal used at the Oak Creek expansion units. If significant modifications are required, we expect to seek approval from the Wisconsin Commission in late 2014.", "On the natural gas side of our business, we're planning to build a new natural gas lateral in west-central Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Commission has scheduled technical and public hearings for mid-May on this project, and we anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter of this year. The 85 mile line would run from Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in Monroe County. The project will address reliability concerns in Western Wisconsin and meet growing demand. Demand is being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in the region.", "I might add that all 10 communities along our preferred route have now passed resolutions authorizing us to begin operating natural gas distribution systems within their borders. If we receive timely approval, we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project is expected to cost between $150 million and $170 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "This winter's bitter cold simply underscores the need to expand our natural gas distribution network in the western part of the state. You may have read there were serious propane shortages across the region, and as I mentioned, we delivered more natural gas to customers during the first quarter of this year than during any other quarter in history.", "We're also pursuing and launching another potential investment opportunity, the potential sale of the state of Wisconsin's electric and steam-generating plants. Last year, Governor Walker signed into law a new state budget. That budget includes a provision expanding the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties. This means that the administration has the authority to pursue the sale of the state's electric steam and chilled water production and distribution facilities. The state is moving forward and is now in the final stages of selecting a financial advisor and a broker for the potential sale of a number of assets, including the plants. No formal timetable has been announced but if the sale does take place, we expect it would occur in 2015.", "Turning now to Wisconsin regulatory matters. In May, we plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission that will cover our investment and our projected expenses for the 2015 and 2016 test years.", "And finally, before closing my remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our operations in Michigan. Under Michigan law, retail customers may choose an alternative energy supplier. The law limits customer choice to 10% of Michigan's retail sales. But the law excludes from this cap the iron ore mines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The 2 iron ore mines that we were serving on a low-margin, interruptible tariff switched to an alternative supplier in September of 2013. Several smaller retail customers have switched as well. Of course, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions regardless of the power supplier. We've taken and will continue to take multiple steps to address this situation. We filed a request with MISO, the mid-continent grid operator, to suspend the operation of all 5 of our units at the Presque Isle Power Plant. Last fall, however, MISO determined that all the units are necessary to maintain reliability in Northern Michigan. As a result, we're eligible for system support resource payments from MISO to recover our costs for operating the units. Under our agreement, MISO will pay us an availability fee to ensure that the units are maintained and available to run and a fee to cover our costs when the units are actually operating. On April 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accepted our 1-year agreement with MISO. The payments will be retroactive to February 1 of this year.", "It's also important to note that we will need to invest in environmental upgrades at the Presque Isle plant to meet EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by 2016. Since we expect the units will still be needed for reliability at that time, we anticipate the cost of these upgrades will be reimbursed through an agreement with MISO.", "So in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, our company is off to a strong start, both financially and operationally, in 2014. And now for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, the famous Pat Keyes.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 first quarter earnings were $0.91 a share compared with $0.76 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2013.", "Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.", "Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $381.8 million as compared to $321 million in 2013. That's an increase of $60.8 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $292.7 million for 2014, an increase of $62.1 million over the first quarter of 2013.", "On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we estimate that our electric and gas margins improved by $32.6 million because of the weather. We experienced temperatures that were 24% colder than normal and 16% colder than last year. Our earnings were also helped by $14.2 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant.", "Last year, we could not recognize the grant income until the plant was complete. Finally, our utility nonfuel operations and maintenance costs are down by $13 million, driven in large part by lower pension and medical costs.", "Now turning to our nonutility segment. Operating income in this segment was down $1.4 million when compared to 2013. Last year, we recorded onetime entries to reflect the final approval of our Power the Future plant cost in the last Wisconsin rate case. Making the changes for these 2 segments together and a slight improvement in corporate and other, you arrive at the $60.8 million increase in operating income.", "During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $17.3 million, an increase of $700,000 over the same period last year. These earnings are in line with our expectations.", "Our other income net declined by $3.3 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased as a result of the completion of the biomass plant last November. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.7 million, primarily because of lower debt levels. Our debt at the end of this quarter was $56.4 million lower than at the end of last year's first quarter. Consolidated income tax expense rose by $29.9 million because of higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $207.6 million of net income for the first quarter 2014 or earnings of $0.91 per share. Our earnings per share also were helped by approximately $0.01 because of our share repurchases.", "During the first quarter of 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $385.1 million, which is a $54.8 million increase from 2013. The increase came primarily from higher net income and a better working capital position.", "Our capital expenditures totaled $129.2 million in the first quarter, a $4.4 million decrease compared to 2013. We saw slightly lower expenditures because construction of the biomass project was completed in 2013. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of March. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid securities is common equity, which is consistent with past presentations.", "The projected year-end debt to total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2013 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "We also paid $88.1 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of $10.3 million over the first quarter last year. Dividends for 2014 equate to an annual rate of $1.56 per share.", "And as shown in the earnings package on our website, retail deliveries of electricity rose by 3.6% in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to the first quarter of 2013. Our normalized first quarter sales were up by 1.7%.", "Looking at the individual customer segments, with the extremely cold weather, we saw actual residential sales up 5.8%, and on a normalized basis, residential sales were up 1.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, we saw quarterly delivery sales up 3.8%, and on a normalized basis, sales of small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.8%.", "In the large commercial and industrial segment, on a normalized basis, delivery sales for the first quarter of 2014 were up 1.6%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales were up 1.8%. Overall, these results are ahead of our expectations.", "First quarter retail natural gas sales were up nearly 19% compared to the first quarter of 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 3.2%. These results are also ahead of our expectations for the year.", "Turning now to our earnings forecast. First, we are raising our 2014 guidance. Our prior guidance was $2.53 a share to $2.63 a share. Our revised guidance is $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. While our first quarter clearly exceeded our expectations, we still have 9 more months of weather ahead of us. So again, our revised guidance for 2014 is $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. And for the second quarter, our guidance is $0.49 a share to $0.51 a share. This assumes normal weather. Our second quarter guidance is slightly lower than the $0.52 we earned in the second quarter of 2013 due to the timing of operations and maintenance expense and fuel recoveries.", "And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.", "Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "This is actually Paul Zimbardo for Julien. Just a quick question on the plant in the environmental recovery. Could you provide kind of a little background there and time line, if you could?", "Gale E. Klappa", "The plant in the environmental -- are you talking about...", "Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "The SSR in Presque Isle.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, okay. Let me frame it for you and Allen can give you some of the details. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one way to look at this really is that MISO, the Midwest grid operator, has basically become the principal customer for that plant. So MISO, under our agreement and with approval from FERC, is basically paying us to operate the plant. Now the plant will become subject to the new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by 2016. So environmental investments will be needed if the plant is going to continue to operate. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Right. And Julian (sic) [Paul], that's of course, the MATS rule that we have to be in compliance with by April of 2016. So our expectation would be that we would be able to do dry sorbent injection at the plant. Cost range for that, when we were doing some testing in June, but I would expect that the range of costs for that in terms of a capital investment is $6 million to $12 million is a likely range, if we had to do dry sorbent injection for all 5 units, if MISO wanted us to maintain all 5 of the units. And then as Gale mentioned just now and in the script, our expectation would be that those dollars would be recovered in a system support resource agreement with MISO.", "Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. So a total of $6 million to $12 million for all of the units [ph]?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes. So if we had to put DSI, if they wanted us to maintain all 5, $6 million to $12 million for all 5, Julien (sic) [Paul].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, I was going to have -- the first question is, how many points are you going to give me on that Green Baby?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We'll negotiate.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "My second question is, when we think about your long-term articulated earnings growth aspiration, Gale, should we still be thinking about it off of the original guidance? Or should we be basing our expectations off of the new guidance, taking into account the weather and the accounting -- the treasury grant and those other items?", "Gale E. Klappa", "On the 4 to 6? Okay. Well, really, Greg, as you know, the weather can move us in one direction or another pretty quickly. So I would suggest you maintain your look in terms of the longer-term growth rate of our normal guidance of 4% to 6% -- or of our guidance of 4% to 6% EPS growth based on normal weather.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I'm just curious, on the increased guidance, is it all weather related? Or is it also a piece of -- a component of that is how that weather-normalized sales are tracking ahead of your expectations?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, first, I'd like to know what you did with Pat at that dinner. But anyway, you're talking about our revised guidance for the remainder of 2014?", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Correct.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Basically, what we've done is taken into account some impact from the weather. On the other hand, we know we're going to see some additional operation and maintenance expenses, gas leak inspections and other distribution network work that has got to be carried on is going to raise our O&M some going forward. So in essence, what we've done is tempered our look at Q1, knowing that there are going to be some additional O&M coming down the pike and raise our guidance slightly as you saw. So basically, weather-driven offset by what we know is going to be some higher O&M. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Gale, I think that you nailed it. I think that's the main points, Brian.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I think your long-term weather-normalized sales forecast is 0.7%. Should we bump that up to what we've seen in the first quarter? Or is it still too early for that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Way too early for that, Brian. As you know, the weather normalization techniques in our industry tend to fall apart or tend to be less accurate when you get into the tail, when you get beyond 2 standard deviations. And I think with this weather in the first quarter, we were like 8 standard deviations away from norm. So I wouldn't read too much into weather normalization for Q1, and I think our roughly 0.5% projection for the normal growth is still pretty accurate.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then do you plan on issuing any debt at the utility in 2014?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We will ask Mr. -- we do have some maturities, but in fact one where we had a bond offering just matured, so we do have some plans.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Yes, Brian, we got a couple of things coming. At Wisconsin Electric, the WEPCo side, we had a bond mature last month. So I would say -- and that was about $300 million, I would say some time in the second quarter, we're optimistic it might go a little later, but let's just say second quarter, we'll probably do something around that size. And then you may recall that last year, we had a bond mature at Wisconsin Gas, I think that was $45 million, $50 million in that zip code. We've been able to manage that but we anticipate that some time, probably the third quarter, in the neighborhood of $100 million, we will probably do something at Wisconsin Gas this year at well -- as well, excuse me.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just lastly, the fuel costs and the 2% dead band, where did you guys end up at the end of the quarter?", "Gale E. Klappa", "At the end of the quarter, we're above the dead band.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. I would just imagine the off-system sales are helping to support that.", "Gale E. Klappa", "No question about that, absolutely. In fact, as you probably heard me say in the script, our off-system sales were up 157%. I mean, really, our units, I'm very pleased with how our units performed. And the Valley of our new Oak Creek units was absolutely completely visible during Q1. And MISO asked those units to run at the top virtually every single day of Q1.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Remind me, filing rate cases in Wisconsin, do you -- the test year, is it a forward or backward test year? And does weather get adjusted out?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, as you may recall, Kit, and then you look at 50 different states, so it's hard to recall specifically, they're one of the few in the country with a 2-year forward-looking test year. So what we are doing now in finalizing all of the data, we will be looking at and filing our projected investment and our projected expenses for the years 2015 and 2016. So that is basically the standard approach in Wisconsin. I think it's a constructive approach because you're not actually looking back with a lot of lag. You're actually projecting your appropriate expenses for the following 2 years.", "Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, absolutely. And what is your early -- last go-round, the ROE was not a topic for discussion in the rate case. Is that likely to be repeated? Or should we have a fully litigated situation where ROE is kind of in its traditional central place in a rate case?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good question, very good question. And let me just say this. There are a lot of discussions going on. Alliant, one of our sister utilities here in Wisconsin, has just entered into a settlement. Now they're, because of a particular situation they have, they're able to keep rates flat for a couple of years. But there, they and the intervenor groups and the commission staff appear to have agreed on a, in essence, setting rates for the electric utility at a 10.2% return. So I think that may be indicative -- we're having some discussions as well about ROE and capital structure. But I would not expect significant change, particularly in light of the first step forward between Alliant and the intervenor groups.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. One, pretty easy. Can you walk us through -- you mentioned a lot of different items, a lot of different projects and the potential capital costs, including the environmental pollution control equipment at Presque Isle. Is any of that not in your current CapEx guidance that you guys have given out over the last couple of months and put in your 10-K and other data?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Michael, good question. Virtually everything we discussed is in our -- it's like Ragu, it's in there. But we should be very clear about the capital cost that Allen talked about related to Presque Isle, a potential capital cost related to Presque Isle. Those would be costs that we would expect because of the need for those units for reliability to be reimbursed. So I really wouldn't look at that as part of our announced capital budget.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And I apologize, I missed Allen's comments about the level or extent of that capital spend on Presque Isle.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Allen, would you like to repeat?", "Allen L. Leverett", "No, what we said before, Michael, was that it was likely to be $6 million to $12 million. We're doing some testing this summer and so we'll be able to nail down where we're going to be in the range. And that would be for dry sorbent injection. And so that would assume we do all 5 units. If for some reason MISO didn't want all 5 units, well, that $6 million to $12 million range would go down somewhat, Michael, but that's for 5 units.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And Allen, as long as I've got you, can you give an update a little bit on ATC's rate base growth expectation and ATC growth opportunities outside of the state of Wisconsin?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Yes. Well, as we talked a little bit on the -- on our year-end call about ATC's capital budget and for the next 3 years, their capital budget inside the footprint, so this would be for calendar years '14, '15, '16, would be $1.3 billion. So that's unchanged from the estimates that we talked about on our last earnings call. So at that level of spending, when you sort of translate that into net income growth at ATC, Michael, that certainly fully supports the 4% to 6% target that Gale and, I think, Greg Gordon were talking about earlier. In terms of opportunities outside the footprint, the $1.3 billion that I talked about for '14, '15, '16 combined, that doesn't include anything outside the footprint at all. ATC is certainly pursuing things elsewhere in the MISO footprint, pursuing things in the western part of the country. But at this point, Michael, I would not expect any of those investments to materialize, or at least for us to actually employ capital for some of those investments until, say, the '17, '18, '19 timeframe. So I wouldn't put any of those opportunities in sort of the next 36 months or so. They're going to be out a bit. But even without those, they still got a lot of good growth over the next 3 years, even without those opportunities.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And last question, I'll add one on here real quick. Gale, natural gas demand, do you think -- I mean, we're now several quarters for you guys. I mean, if I go back, it's really 3 or 4, 4 or 5 quarters now. Do you think we're seeing a structural shift in what is weather-normalized natural gas demand? And if so, what do you think the new level is? I mean, historically, natural gas demand had been on a long-term downward slope for 15 to 20 years. And I wonder if something's happened that's not weather related but structural that's changing what weather-normalized gas demand is.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I understand your wife likes it hotter, but other than that, Michael, I think that, and not in any way trying to avoid the question, but trying to be absolutely brutally frank with you, the weather has been so abnormal, in particular what we've seen in Q1, that I think we're going to need another year or 2 before we can really determine whether there's any structural change going on here. On the one hand, you see data that indicates that maybe there is a structural change but then on the other hand, gas prices are now higher than they've been in a while. Natural gas prices are now higher than they've been in a while. Last time I looked, at about $4.80 per million BTU. Furnaces, new furnaces are still much more efficient, let's say, a 10- or 15-year-old furnace. There are a lot of competing factors going on here. I think it's going to take a little bit longer before we can really understand if there is any kind of structural change that would reverse the pattern of the past 20 years.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "One follow-up to Greg Gordon's question, this 4% to 6% growth. I was a little unclear as to whether or not the base year had been shifted around a little bit.", "Gale E. Klappa", "No, the base year has not shifted. We will take a look, as we enter 2015, about shifting the base year. But right now, the base year stays in place.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "So that's 2011, just to confirm.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You're absolutely correct.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Second question is my standard capital allocation question. But this time, I have a twist.", "Gale E. Klappa", "A twist? All right.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So you know I'm not a fan of you guys buying back stock better than 2x book. But it seems to me that if I did the math correctly, you bought 426,000 shares in the first quarter, and if I just take a simple arithmetic average between year-end price and the March end prize, you're buying back stock in the $44 a share range or $18 million with the stock. And if you've got a new $300 million program in place annualized at $100 million a year, that should be $25 million a quarter. Am I reading anything into the fact that this is now down on what an annualized run rate would be and that you're starting to shy away from buying back stock at these levels?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I've heard the rumor that you're not a fan of buying back stock at 2x books, so I'm glad you admitted this.", "James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division", "In fact, even in print.", "Gale E. Klappa", "I know, exactly. But we can't read everything you see in print, or you can't believe everything you see in print. I'm just giving you a hard time. First of all, one of the things that -- one of our guiding principles has been that as we have positive cash flow materialize, that if we don't have other investment opportunities on the near-term horizon for the use of that cash, then one of our philosophies is, we don't think our shareholders will reward us for just building up cash on the balance sheet. So that's one of our other guiding principles here and I would not read anything into our first quarter activity other than we tend to look at it quarter by quarter as we have cash building up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar Research.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Quick question. Any idea on the potential cost of the Oak Creek fuel flexibility program? Or are we still too early in the stages?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Too early, but we've put a bookend around it, again, depending upon the specific equipment modifications that might be needed. Our bookends, and we'll know a lot more later this year, are at a low end, maybe $25 million, $30 million; at the high end, maybe $100 million.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then just trying to get a handle on around the growth opportunity for propane customers switching to gas. Can you provide a little more color on the extent of the growth opportunity here and kind of what is the penetration level of current customers so far?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, I will say this. In terms of propane consumption, just pure propane consumption, Wisconsin is one of the top 5 states in the country. So I think that gives you a sense of the potential conversion opportunity here. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, even in Q1, which was a pretty brutal time to try to switch furnaces, we saw a 7% increase so far this year in new customer connections to our natural gas network compared to a year ago. So I honestly think the conversion opportunity, particularly in light of what happened to propane pricing, but even more so the severe shortages of propane this past winter, I think the conversion opportunity is perhaps even greater than we thought.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli with Nexus.", "Bill Appicelli", "Just had a follow-up on the Presque Isle issue. I believe you guys have a -- there's an open doc at FERC related to this issue and I was just wondering if you guys could sort of remind me of what your position is or what's trying to be accomplished there?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I'll let Allen give you the details. The open docket at FERC is really about cost allocations. In other words, we have an agreement with MISO on payment of about $52 million for the next 12 months to compensate us for maintaining and operating those units. And then the open docket really relates, as we understand it, to who has to pay MISO for that $52 million. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett", "No, that's right. I wouldn't add anything to that.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay.", "Bill Appicelli", "Okay. And do you guys have any sense of the timing of that or how that would impact, I guess, some of these other decisions you guys were talking about earlier?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, the SSR agreement is for 1 year. So it goes from, I think, February 1 of this year to February 1 of next year, and I think MISO has like a 3-month extension option. So if they want us to continue to operate the plant after that, and I expect they will, we'll have to do another SSR agreement. But I would expect, given FERC, they went ahead and let us start -- MISO start charging and MISO start paying us. So I don't really think the fact that there's a review going on at FERC is going to affect any of that. It might take a number of months. We might be to the end of the year before they resolve the allocation question that Gale talked about. But it's not really going to impact our ability to collect dollars from MISO at all. So it's really not an issue for us as we would see it.", "Bill Appicelli", "Okay. But is it an allocation between Michigan and Wisconsin?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well, it's an issue about interstate, so allocation between the states. And to a certain degree, you'll also get into some allocation issues within Wisconsin. So it's a fairly complicated question about how these costs are ultimately allocated.", "Gale E. Klappa", "In essence, the issue is that in other parts of MISO, these kinds of costs are allocated in a certain way, but within the ATC footprint, they're allocated in a separate way. And the Wisconsin Commission's view is that the allocation that affects -- the allocation in effect, if you were inside the ATC footprint, is punitive to Wisconsin, and that's really the issue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP.", "Vedula Murti", "So all of my questions are actually asked and answered.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.", "Andrew Levi", "Just on Bill's question, did the state of Wisconsin intervene on this case?", "Allen L. Leverett", "In the FERC proceeding, Andy, yes, they did.", "Andrew Levi", "And what's their issue?", "Allen L. Leverett", "When you said the state of Wisconsin, the public [indiscernible]. Their issue is allocation. They don't believe that the MISO tariff, as currently structured, provides for a fair allocation as between Wisconsin and Michigan. So that's really their issue. Their issue is not the total cost, it's the allocation of the cost.", "Gale E. Klappa", "In fact, Allen's right, Andy. In fact, in their intervention asking FERC to provide for a different allocation between Wisconsin and Michigan, they actually said that they believe we should be compensated in the way we're being compensated. It's just who has to make that compensation, how much to Michigan, how much to Wisconsin, is the issue.", "Andrew Levi", "And what's the breakdown now?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, now, it's close to 90-10. In other words, 90% of these SSR payments will be billed to Wisconsin customers and about 10% to Michigan and that is what has the Wisconsin Commission concerned. They think that that's not a proper allocation, that much more of the cost should go to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. But it's not a situation where if FERC rules against them, they don't -- they come after you or anything like that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "No. As Allen said earlier, we don't think this has any impact on the agreement itself and on our -- and on the payments to us for operating the unit. It's just a matter of how is the pie sliced among parties that have to pay MISO for this benefit.", "Andrew Levi", "Right, right. So it's really the PFC fighting FERC, not [ph] fighting you guys?", "Gale E. Klappa", "You could look at it that way. I think what the PFC and Wisconsin...", "Andrew Levi", "Or MISO or however you want to look at it.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Exactly. Really trying to get the MISO tariff or this part of MISO to match up with the rest of MISO because it's different here that -- just the way the cost allocation works. If you're inside the American Transmission Company footprint, that cost allocation is different than all the rest of MISO, and the Wisconsin Commission is saying it needs to be all the same.", "Andrew Levi", "Okay. And then another question. It's the one I think Jim was going to ask. I'm just guessing, but I did want to ask, so I'll ask the question. There's an article earlier in the year...", "Gale E. Klappa", "Is he under the desk, Andy?", "Andrew Levi", "I'm sorry. No, I'm just guessing and I might be wrong, I shouldn't speak for Jim. But there was an article earlier in the year, Bloomberg article relating to you and M&A. And you were name with a myriad of other companies relative to Berkshire Hathaway, and I was just wondering if you want to address that or not.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Andy, as you know, that article, in all likelihood, was based on pure speculation, and over the years, we found it not very productive to comment on speculation. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating.

Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's quarterly conference call. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions] Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language.", "All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.", "During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers.", "In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today.", "And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale E. Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 second quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.", "Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.58 a share for the second quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.52 a share for last year's second quarter. Despite a cool and a rainy June that significantly reduced customer demand, we delivered solid results. And I must add that cost related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group reduced earnings by a penny a share during the quarter.", "Turning now to the state of the economy, Wisconsin unemployment rate declined to 5.7% in June and remains well below the national average, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it\u2019s been since 2008. (inaudible) broader economic backdrop deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers excluding the iron ore mines rose by 2.1% in the second quarter. We saw strength in several sectors including paper manufacturing, food products, rubber and plastics and primary metals.", "In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. The electric service connections are up by 3.6% and the new natural gas installations are up 8.5% compared with the same period year. These gains reflect a bit stronger economy and the volume of customer switching from propane to natural gas.", "Later in my prepared remarks, I will update you on several positive developments in our core business as well as the progress we are making on the important construction projects we have underway. But first I would like to touch on our recent announcement to acquire Integrys Energy Group.", "Just to refresh your memory on June 23rd, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combing the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise scale and financial resources to meet the region\u2019s future energy needs.", "We will be serving 4.3 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota in fact the combination will create the eight largest natural gas distribution company in America and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be prudently invested in new and upgraded energy infrastructure.", "Now as you well aware, we have consistently used three criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition. First, we would have believed that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would need to be largely credit neutral and finally we would have to believe there is a long term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal the Wisconsin Energy\u2019s standalone growth rate. I am pleased to reiterate with you that we believe this combination meets or exceeds all three criteria.", "We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year faster than either one of us projecting on a standalone basis. And importantly more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses.", "Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with an increased scale and geographic proximity and over the time will enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices system-wide.", "In addition, as many of you know Integrys today is one of the major owners of American transmission company with a 34.1% interest, Wisconsin Energy is the second largest owner with a 26.2% interest. The combined entity will have a 60% stake and what is the largest independent transmission company in the country.", "As you may remember, ATC\u2019s ten year plan calls for investing between $3 billion to $3.6 billion, the bolster electric reliability in our region, it\u2019s a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment.", "Now in light of the acquisition, we have terminated our share repurchase program. The Integrys transaction will allow us to use our strong cash flow will allow us to use our strong cash flow for regulated investments. The proposed dividend policy of the combined company will be designed to keep Integrys shareholders neutral initially after taking into consideration both the stock and cash they will receive.", "In the period before closing, Wisconsin Energy plans to continue with its current dividend policy and of course that policy calls for 7% to 8% annual increase in our dividend.", "At closing, we would expect a further dividend increase for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. Then going forward, projected payout target for the combined company will be 65% to 70% of earnings", "The transaction of course is subject to approvals from the shareholders of both companies and several regulatory agencies. The agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications' Commission, the Public Service Commissions of Wisconsin and Michigan, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The transaction is also subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. We planned to file for approval of the acquisition in each of the four states next week. Filings at the Federal level are expected to be made before the end of August. We anticipate closing the transaction sometime during the second half of 2015.", "Also you may have seen the announcement this morning from Integrys and Exelon, Exelon\u2019s constellation business unit has agreed to purchase Integrys unregulated power and natural gas marketing business. Exelon will pay $60 million for the Integrys retail operations plus adjusted networking capital at the time of closing. That working capital was about $183 million as of May 31 2014. The Integrys management team plans to provide you with an update during their quarterly earnings call which is now scheduled for August 7.", "Again, we believe our combination with Integrys will create the premiere regulated utility system in the Midwest with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come, the benefits to all stakeholders and the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value, our clear compelling and achievable.", "And now turning back to recent developments in Wisconsin Energy core business. On July 18, we have received the final written order from the Wisconsin commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral in the west central Wisconsin. This 85 mile pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County from the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in west central Wisconsin. The project will address reliability concerns in region and meet growing demand.", "Demand of course has been driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in western Wisconsin. The commission\u2019s approval also includes franchise awards for ten communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those ten communities. We expect to begin construction early next year on the project and complete the entire project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our projected cost is between $175 million and $185 million excluding allowance for funds used during constructions.", "On the generation side of our business, you will recall that we are converting the fuel source for our valley power plant from coal to natural gas, the two unit valley plant the cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I am pleased to report to you that the unit one conversion is now well under way. We stopped using coal at the unit in mid July and our scheduled calls for start-up and boiler tuning to begin in October in advance of course of the winter heating season. We plan to have unit one fully converted into natural gas by the end of the year. Valley would be available to operate at full power this winter with the unit one burning natural gas and unit two continuing to burn coal. Unit two is then scheduled to be converted to natural gas during 2015. We expect the total conversion cost to be $65 million to $70 million again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Now you may recall that in March of last year, we also began the major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the Valley facility. This pipeline replacement project has an estimated cost of approximately $30 million and is on time and on budget.", "Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating cost and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts and we believe our plan will help support a vibrate downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.", "Next, I would like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Twin Falls was built way back in 1912 and it's one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the boarder of Wisconsin and Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. Construction is underway now to build the new powerhouse and spillway capacity that meets current Federal standards.", "Since our last updates, we began major construction work which includes building cofferdams and test blasting to prepare for rock excavation. These activities are scheduled for completion later this year; we expect that the new powerhouse will be operational in 2015. We plan to remove the old powerhouse during 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million again excluding allowance for funds used during constructions.", "We are also making just excellent progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were originally permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers $25 million to $50 million a year depending on the mix.", "Last year we received environmental permits began making changes to the boilers and testing of blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at the plant. And just a few weeks ago on July 7, we took the next step and filed the request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve $25 million of additional capital spending for modifications at the plant. If approved, these modifications will enable testing of up to 100% PRB coal. However, I should point out that to operate the units above at 20% PRB blend on a sustain basis further investment will be needed in fuel storage and handling equipment. Just the reminder, our end goal is to have the flexibility at the new Oak Creek units to increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal up to 100%.", "Next, I would like to discuss the investment opportunities that we see as we focus on delivering the future. As we have previously reported to you, our capital budget calls for spending between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion over the five year period between now and 2018. In this five year budget, the nature of our capital spending is shifting away from large projects such as our power the future units, renewable generation of larger quality controls. Instead our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will continue to improve our generation and upgrade our aging distribution networks, over the next five years will have a much greater focus on pipes, polls, wires, transformers, and sub-stations, the building blocks of our delivery business.", "The primary risk associated with these projects are naturally more manageable even with the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work but this work is no less valuable or important than the mega projects we have completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status is one of the most reliable utilities in America. So we will keep you posted as these needed infrastructure projects move forward.", "We are also monitoring another investment opportunity, the potential sale of the State of Wisconsin generation plants. Last year, you will recall Governor Walker signed in the law a new state budget. That budget includes a provision expanding the state\u2019s authority to sell or lease certain state on properties. This means that the administration has the authority to pursue the sale of the state's electric, steam and chilled water generation and distribution facilities. Financial advisors have now been selected by the state and an asset broker has been named for the potential sale of the plants. No formal timetable has yet been announced but if the sale does take place, we expect that would occur in 2015.", "Turning now to Wisconsin regulatory matters, in May we reached the rate settlement facilitated by the Wisconsin Commission staff with three major customer groups, the settlement covers return on equity, capital structure and base rate changes for the forward looking test years 2015 and 2016. If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, Wisconsin Electric will have a return on equity of 10.2% with no change and its capital structure. Wisconsin Gas will have a return on equity of 10.3% with a higher equity component in its capital structure. The equity midpoint for Wisconsin thus would increase from 47.5% to 49.5%.", "Based on the settlement nonfuel electric rates will increase by 1.4% beginning in 2015, we expect these changes to be effective on January 1st. During the final months of this year, the remainder of the rate case will focus on rate design and on 2015 fuel cost recovery and with that \u2013 with that long update I would be happy to turn the things over to our Chief Financial Officer Pat Keyes, who will provide you more details on our second quarter results, Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 second quarter earnings were $0.58 a share as compared with $0.52 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2013. Cost related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter.", "Now consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.", "Our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $240.7 million as compared with $229.5 million in 2013. That's an increase of $11.2 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $155.2 million for 2014, an increase of $16.3 million over the second quarter of 2013.", "On a quarter-over-quarter basis, utility operations and maintenance cost declined by $40 million primarily because of lower medical, pension and other post employment benefit costs. Our earnings were also helped by $13.8 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant.", "Our second quarter 2014 earnings were hurt by a cool west spring, we estimate that our electric and gas margins declined by $5 million as a result of the weather. We also saw increased depreciation cost of $4.6 million primarily because of the biomass plant that was placed on a service in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "Combining these and other factors results in a $16.3 million increase in utility operating income in the second quarter of 2014 as compared with the same quarter in the prior year.", "Operating income in our nonutility segment was $91.7 million which is right in line with the prior year. Our corporate and other segment which includes corporate costs and smaller affiliates recorded $5.2 million with an increased cost in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the second quarter 2013. The increased costs are directly related to the proposed acquisition of the Integrys Group. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the $11.2 million increase in operating income.", "During the second quarter, earnings from our investment in the American transmission company totaled $17.5 million, an increase of $200,000 over the same period last year. These earnings are in line with our expectation. Our other income net increased by $2.3 million.", "During the second quarter 2014 we\u2019ve recognized gains in the sale of property in our west part subsidiary and land sales in the utility.", "Our net interest expense decreased by $4.3 million primarily because of lower debt levels and more average interest rates. Over the past year, we were able to issue long-term debt at interest rates at the lower than the maturing debt.", "Consolidated income tax expense rose by $4 million because of higher pretax earnings partially offset by a slightly lower tax rate for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $133 million of net income for the first second quarter 2014 or earnings of $0.58 per share. Again, these earnings include just over a penny of cost associated with the acquisition of Integrys.", "During the first six months of 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $721.3 million which is a $39.8 million increase from the first six months of 2013. We have collected $76.2 million this year related to the treasury grant. This benefit was partially offset by higher working capital requirements.", "Our capital expenditures totaled $305.5 million in the first six months of 2014; $1.8 million decrease compared it to 2013.", "Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of June. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid securities is common equity which is consistent with past presentations. Earlier in the year, we projected that our year-end debt-to-total capital will be relatively flat with our 2013 year-end ratio of 52.5%.", "Now with the termination of share repurchase program, we expect to see our year end debt to total capital below to last year's ratio. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for 401-K plan, options and other programs. We also paid $176 million in common dividends in the first six months of 2014, an increase of $20.4 million over the same period last year. Dividends for 2014 equate to an annual rate of $1.56 per share.", "Retail deliveries of electricity rose by 3% in the first half of 2014 as compared to first half of 2013. Our normalized first half deliveries were up by 2.3%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw actual residential deliveries up 1.2% on a normalized basis which were flat with 2013.", "Across our small commercial industrial group, we saw year-to-date deliveries up 9% to 10%, another normalized basis, we were down two times of percent. In the large commercial industrial segment on a normalized basis, deliveries for the first half of 2014 were up by 6.6%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines we were up 2%. Overall these results are in line with our expectations.", "First half retail natural gas sales were up 13.8% compared to the first half of 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 2.5%. Results from our natural gas delivery business are ahead of our expectations for the year.", "Moving to other items of interest, in May of 2014 our electric subsidiary issued a $250 million, 30 year bond at a coupon of 4.25%. This bond is essentially replaced by $300 million bond with a coupon of 6% that came due in April.", "Turing now to our earnings forecast. We are maintaining our 2014 guidance of $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. Our 2014 guidance excludes cost related to the Integrys acquisition. While our results for the first half of the year exceeded our expectations, we have had a very cool summer. As many of you know we typically see our largest cooling demand during the warm summer days of July.", "However, we only have had four July since 1960 that have been cooler than the July of 2014. In fact Milwaukee has not seen a single 90 degree day this summer. So taking into account this cool July weather and looking at the continued cool forecast in August our third quarter guidance is $0.48 a share to $0.50 a share. This too excludes cost associated with the Integrys acquisition.", "Our third quarter guidance also reflects lower fuel recoveries as compared to the same quarter in 2013. These are largely timing issues that were factored into our 2014 fuel plant. So again, the range for our third quarter guidance is $0.48 a share to $0.50 a share and with that I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Pat, thank you very much let me zip up my parka before we go into the Q&A. Overall folks were on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "Now we would like to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Rock and roll Greg how are you?", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group", "I am doing great, Gale. How are you?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We are good.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "So one question you may not be able to answer but the Integrys announced the sale of their retail business -- the press release hit last night. I know you are at arm\u2019s length on that when you look at the price that was announced, was that consistent with your understanding of the economics? Does it has anything to do \u2013 affect in any way the economics of your transaction or was it in line with your expectations?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Greg, very good question, certainly. In my conversations with my counterpart of Integrys we were supportive of the sale and the results as you saw published this morning in the new release were quite consistent with our expectations.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "Great and I have a couple of questions that are probably CFO level questions. When I look at the revenues you have generated year-to-date from the different customer classes, electric revenues look more or less consistent in residential small commercial is the same as large commercial industrial is obviously down on bunch unrealized revenue and then it's more than offset by significant improvements in resell and other, so an you talk about what is driving that shift and how we should think about that prospectively?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well, Pat and Scott are thinking, are you saying that those questions are above or below my pay-grade, which?", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "Yes, the answer is yes.", "James Patrick Keyes", "Greg, Scott and me take team a little bit. But to get the \u2013 we talked in the first couple calls about opportunity of sales and if you look at the year-to-date we did quite well in the beginning of the year. And that's certainly driving a part of it and Scott do you want to add color to that at all or?", "Scott Lauber", "Yes the opportunity of sales are there but also on our other operating revenues we have the payment with the SSR payments for (inaudible) power plant.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay and the large commercial industrial falloff is the iron ore mines?", "James Patrick Keyes", "On the sales side, yes. That\u2019s why we kind of with the mine decision last year we started reporting both sales and deliveries. So with the mines decision the sales numbers will fall commensurately but we kept the delivery numbers there so you kind of have an apples to apples to prior year on how much we are delivering.", "Gale E. Klappa", "The sales would include the generation side of the business; deliveries because we are still delivering electricity of the mines would include just total deliveries to all of our customers.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "Understood and then the treasury grants are significant portion of your earnings contribution this year. Is the way that's going to work is when the plant comes up and running, treasury grants are going to sort of stop coming in but the plant will actually start earning and so you won\u2019t see any significant sort of fluctuation in earnings. How is that going to work? ", "Gale E. Klappa", "That one is not below my pay grade so let me give you the facts on that and then Steve Dickson can help me if there is anything obscure. But essentially last year while the plant was under contraction, we were delivering the customer\u2019s bill credits from the Federal tax grant that we expected to receive from the treasury department for building a biomass unit. Where the accounting rules worked, we basically took a three center share hit because we were actually paying cash credit on bills to customers in each of the first three quarters of 2013. So $0.03 in each of those three quarters, then when the plant went commercial, we completed the plant on time and on budget and brought it into service in November of last year, under the accounting rules we were able to book the grant. So there was a true up in Q4 of last year if you will, I think it was $0.09 pickup Steven in Q4 of last year. So forwarding that Greg, to our second quarter results this year, we didn't have any negative impact from the bill credits and we did last year. So we had three cent a share pick up in Q2 of this year because of the accounting rules compared to Q2 of last year. Am I making sense Greg?", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "Hundred percent and how long do those treasury grant run through the P&L?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I think two years.", "Steve Dickson", "Yes in the right case we are going to give back to Wisconsin customers over a two year period and that will end in December of 2014. ", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "Got you and so it will all come out in the wash so to speak when you do your rate design in new requirements for the next \u2013", "Gale E. Klappa", "Absolutely. This will all come up -- this will all be completed basically before the new effective test year of January 2015.", "Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.", "Completely understood. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are welcome, Greg. Good questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please go ahead with your question.", "Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC", "Hi. Good afternoon guys.", "Gale E. Klappa", "How are you doing Kit?", "Kit Konolige - BGC", "Good. So just pretty simple old fashioned utility kind of question. So you have indicated that your level of sales was in line with expectations. So it looks like residential sales are kind of flat, flat to down for the first half or they were down in the first quarter and flat in the second?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes?", "Kit Konolige - BGC", "So what are you seeing there, I mean we have seen there is some other companies, is this any further deterioration in kind of customer usage by customer or just efficiency better refrigerators or tightness in spending on electricity because of the economy or what do we think is going on out there?", "Gale E. Klappa", "We thought about this profoundly and I think it's not enough beer in the refrigerator yet.", "Kit Konolige - BGC", "That\u2019s a big problem in your service territory.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Exactly. Well I will give you my view for what it\u2019s worth. First of all, when you look at our first half, I think it's fair to say that when you compare it to our projection for the year we were expecting retail sales in total to be up about one-half of 1%. But then when you break that down by customer group, large industrial, well actually I think did a little better than expectations both in Q1 and Q2 from industrial demand for electricity and I think we were up 2% Scott in Q1 compared to the first quarter year ago on industrial demand for electricity and 2.1% second quarter compared to Q2 of a year ago.", "So, again breaking down our kind of expectations better than we thought on industrial demand. When you look at small commercial and industrial, maybe a little less than we thought, it's pretty flat and then on residential it's flat, however, that\u2019s on a weather normal basis. And again we had such abnormal weather in the first quarter that I think you have to just take for now our weather normalization with the grain of salt.", "Remember we have talked before Kit that when weather gets beyond the second standard deviation from normal, the industry's weather normalization techniques tend to break down. So I wouldn't read too much into it one way or another. The only I think interesting and perhaps hopeful fact coming out of the first half numbers for us in terms of demand for electricity as the uptake from industrial customers. Scott do you like?", "Scott Lauber", "Yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Kit Konolige - BGC", "Sounds good. Okay just one other area for me and that is I might have missed some of this but what\u2019s the schedule for the state sale of generation?", "Gale E. Klappa", "There have been no formal announcement of the schedule yet, however the state has hired both financial advisors and the broker and they have made that announcement just in the last probably I believe in June. So if there is a sale going forward of state assets we would expect that to be a 2015 event.", "Kit Konolige - BGC", "That would be 2015, when would you expect to hear from the state or to see it published whether they are or aren\u2019t going ahead with it?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Again there\u2019ve been no real indications from the state other than the fact that they believe they\u2019ve made a major step forward in terms of interviewing and hiring specific financial advisors and a broker. Now one complicating factor is that they really are looking at the potential sale of a number of different types of properties though they have hired financial advisors for each type of property as well broker for the potential sale of the plants themselves.", "So they are really trying to organize a much broader potential sale of property than just the power plant themselves.", "Kit Konolige - BGC", "Very good. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are welcome Kit. I appreciate your call.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa", "How is Cleveland Paul?", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "Cleveland rocks.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Alright, I wonder that happened, I am sorry go ahead Paul.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "Last year you did $0.60 in the third you and now you are guiding it down $0.11 to midpoint despite the $0.03 pick up from the tax. Can you just run through the big drivers is it all weather, sorry if I missed that?", "Gale E. Klappa", "It\u2019s really two things and Pat can elaborate if he would like to it\u2019s really weather? We\u2019ll its four things, the first three are weather. I mean literally this has been one of the coldest Julys on record in Wisconsin. I think Pat mentioned in his portion of the prepared remarks, the weather forecast was saying we will not have a single 90 degree day this entire summer in Wisconsin. I\u2019m figuring if this continues Paul we\u2019re going to be at 30 below in October. I mean really it has been incredibly cool and honest to goodness the weather forecast for August looks to be a repeat of July in terms of way colder than normal. So we\u2019ve tried to take into account what we know has occurred in July which is just incredible lack of demand for air conditioning for obvious reasons and extrapolate that to August and then of course there is some timing Pat on fuel recovery.", "James Patrick Keyes", "That's right, Gale. Does that answer your question Paul I can dive in more if you like but that's \u2013 I think that\u2019s the bulk of it.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "How big is the fuel piece?", "James Patrick Keyes", "Round numbers $0.02, $0.03.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "Okay and then just kind of assuming you close Integrys, you own 60% of ATC, how will that pull to your income statement at that point?", "Gale E. Klappa", "I will ask Alan to answer that. He is the king of well know he had a resign his kingdom ATC.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, my assumptions would be Paul that since we will not have effective control of ATC even though we will have 60% economic interest. Since we will not have effective control because of the voting arrangement that we proposed, that we would still follow the equity method of accounting. So over in the asset set, you would have a statement already interest but I guess it's a majority interest in this case but you have a minority interest so you show you equity investment and you just take the earnings down.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "What's the board composition?", "Gale E. Klappa", "The board composition of ATC or the combined company?", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "ATC.", "Allen L. Leverett", "Well I guess when you say the composition let me back up and maybe just quickly go through the voting arrangement that we proposed. So what we proposed Paul is that the new combined company so this would be WEC Energy Group, WEC Energy Group would vote without limitation the 34% that Integrys Energy Group currently holds and then it would vote the remaining 26%, so that\u2019s the 26% the Wisconsin Energy holds now they would vote that in proportion to held the other shareholders vote. So in other words, Paul, we would be essentially in the same position that Integrys is today in terms of control, so that\u2019s how control would work and then you would vote for directors just like you vote for directors now and we will lead the position the same way as Integrys.", "Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc", "I think you went over this on the call when you announced the deal (inaudible) okay, thank you very much.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are welcome. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Bischof with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa", "How are you Andy?", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Good. How are you? Any new share repurchase in the quarter before you announce the Integrys acquisition and cancellation buyback program?", "Gale E. Klappa", "So there were nothing \u2013 there were no share repurchases in Q2.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay and Gale if I could ask your overall thoughts on the EPA\u2019s green power plant announcement in June (inaudible) Wisconsin Energy and your overall discussions with the state regulators so far?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Right, be happy to. Just to refresh everybody's memory, the environmental protection agency issued its proposed rule for CO2 reductions in essence from existing sources. And I believe the comment period now runs until October 16 of this year. Wisconsin's target and as you recall, each of the contiguous 48 states have been given separate CO2 reduction targets. And those targets were designed individually for each state by the staff of the EPA. Wisconsin\u2019s target 34% reduction.", "Nationwide, the reduction target is 30% so we are just slightly above the national average. I think for many of us, while I will give the EPA very, very strong marks for creativity I mean they have never tried to tackle problem with this type of an approach before and they have really tried to give the individual states flexibility. But I don't personally feel like we were given credit for taking early action. I mean we have invested $9 billion in energy infrastructure since 2003 much of that has been either in modern and efficient generating units, renewables energy efficiency, other approaches that can and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions.", "So if you look on our system, our green house gas emissions for the Wisconsin Energy are actually below the levels they were in 2000 and we just don't feel like we have been given credit for the early action and I think that's the standard view among of my counterparts in the industry. So we are going to be commenting on several things as we work our way through the comment period here one of which is we simply don't feel like the appropriate credit has been given for the early action and for the renewables that we have put in place, there is still lack of clarity which EPA admits around how they will treat biomass plants and of course in terms of emissions and of course we have almost $270 million investment we have just completed in our biomass plant that does meets the state's renewable portfolio standards.", "And then one of the building blocks that the EPA has pointed out in terms of how states can try to flexibly meet the new target is to really run the combined cycle of natural gas fired power plants in the country up to 70% capacity factor. That is difficult in many parts not just Wisconsin but in many parts of the country, the natural gas infrastructure to achieve that kind of capacity factor for natural gas units is just not there. It's just not in place. So we think there are a number of comments that we want to make.", "Overall though I still feel like we are quite well positioned as a company and the reason I think we are well positioned as the company is because of how efficient our new units are. Our units at Oak Creek which burn coal as you know, are among the top ten most efficient best log units in the country and one of the cleanest burning power plants literally in the world and our new natural gas unit at Port Washington, our new combined cycle units at Port Washington are the most efficient natural gas units in the Midwest.", "So given the fact that they emit less ounce per CO2 or less ounce of CO2 per unit of output, I still think we are well positioned as anyone. I hope that helps.", "Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Excellent detail. I very much appreciate it.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Hey Gale. Question for you little bit about natural gas demand. What do you think over the last year's weather normalize natural gas demand has been in Wisconsin and what do you think if anything the new normal maybe?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Okay. Well, levelized natural gas demand I would think it has gone up, it has got about 1% over the \u2013", "Allen Leverett", "It\u2019s about 0.5% to 1%.", "Gale E. Klappa", "About 0.5% to 1% what we have seen on weather normal basis. Where is it going? I am still in the camp but there is potential for it to go up however. In the last two years, we have had as I mentioned earlier some of the most abnormal weather both warm and cold that really stresses the weather normalization techniques that the industry applies number one. So that's one thing that I think the jury is still out on.", "We need some more time to be able to determine whether a pattern of growth is stronger than we project. The other piece though is we are continuing to see in our state at any rate, a much quicker conversion of customers from propane to natural gas. You saw the statistics, or heard the statistics from our prepared script but I think we have got in terms of percentage of new customer connections for natural gas this year versus last year, we are up about 8.5%. So there are a number of competing factors here and moving pieces. I think it's still too early to tell whether or not we are in a stronger uptake patterns in terms of weather normalize natural gas consumption at retail. Again in states there are heavy propane users and Wisconsin I believe is the fifth heaviest state in the country in terms of propane use. We see some real potential opportunity.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Second, where does Illinois fall in that kind of realm when you think about potential for conversions and about local gas utility natural gas-related demand? Finally, and I'll knock them all out at once, of the $14 million in lower year-over-year O&M expense, how sustainable is that I mean when we look out to \u201915, \u201916 or \u201917, kind of multi-year out, is that a, hey, we're resetting the bar here to live within some of the regulatory kind of pieces of the regulatory agreement versus this is kind of a one-off?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Alright. Good question again Michael. Let me tackle your Illinois question first. I don't see much in terms of propane conversion opportunity in the Integrys Group companies in Illinois because it's really people's gas so that is downtown and city of Chicago and then north shore which again very-very close to city itself. So I don't see the kinds of propane conversion opportunities in Illinois that we are seeing in Wisconsin and I hope that answers that question.", "And then I would also add in terms of the regulatory construction in Illinois for people's gas they are in a decoupled situation where we are not in Wisconsin. So, two different animals there and then in terms of O&M, in essence what a large chunk of and yes there are some sustainable productivity in cost reduction gains that we saw in the first half and that I think it will be permanent. But the line of share of $14 million of O&M cost reductions really came from lower medical and employee benefit expense and the reason for the medical we believe is that all of our employees switched as of January 1 of this year to high deductible plan. So the comparison maybe a little skewed in terms of medical costs, in terms of timing of when the company gets the medical cost flowing through. So we will see we will have a lot better picture in terms of medical cost and other employment costs, benefit costs, over the course of this year. The pattern maybe a little different this year and I suspect that it will be.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Meaning you think that O&M cost could be more backend loaded versus frontend loaded during the course of the year or I am not sure I totally follow you there.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Sorry. The answer to your question is yes, particularly as it relates to medical. And here is why, I think for an individual we have $2500 deductible and for a family I think it's $5,000. So that was not in place with our low-deductible plans last year. So we suspect that our medical expenses will be back end loaded this year compared to last year and so yes the answer is there maybe some additional medical O&M expenses coming through in Q3 and Q4.", "Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Okay. Thanks Gale. I appreciate it.", "Gale E. Klappa", "You are more than welcome. Take care.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Brian Russo with Ladenburg. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Good afternoon Brian.", "Brian Russo - Ladenburg", "Good afternoon. Just curious, most of my questions were asked and answered but what were the drivers enabling your guys to beat your second quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.52?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well there are three drivers that I would point out and Pat and Scott can certainly add to that if they would like. The first we have talked about earlier which was O&M reduction. That's worth about excluding the merger cost, that's worth about $0.04 a share compared to last year. Then we have talked about the biomass tax credits and because of the accounting rules, there was a $0.03 of share hit in Q2 a year ago versus no hit in this year's second quarter. And then we had a lower effective tax rate which helped us by about a penny. On the negative side, there was a penny of merger cost and a penny of weather. So if you strip all that out, essentially those were the answers.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg", "Right. There was O&M reduction ahead of your expectations I am asking because you have guided to $0.50 to $0.52 in the second quarter but you reported $0.58 so there is something exceeded your original expectations.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes absolutely. Pat, go right ahead.", "James Patrick Keyes", "So yes Brian, sorry. Some of the O&M we didn\u2019t expect. So medical was a little better than we thought. I talked about timing differences hurting us in Q3 in the guidance we actually got little help in Q2 versus what we have planned. I am going to write it off \u2013 start it with there is no one big answer, it's lots of cats and dogs I gave you two, here is a couple more. Gas sales came in a little better than what we had forecast probably because it was colder in the first half in the quarter and then the other income I talked about the land sells in the west park was something we didn\u2019t anticipate either. So lots of little things kind of added up to give us better than guidance.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "James Patrick Keyes", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gale E. Klappa", "How are you Tim?", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Co.", "Good afternoon Gale. I just have a strategic question on ATC, so (inaudible) are the new hot thing and it looks like wind stream just got IRS approval to classify their transmission assets as real estate investment trust. Could you or is there any benefit that you guys have putting ATC in a retype structure?", "Allen L. Leverett", "Tim this is Allen I guess at this point and of course we are certainly open to things that would provide value for our shareholders. So if we found later that it was advantageous to put something in a different structure or some other which certainly be open. However, I think one big issue that we would have to face if I understand the restructure correctly; there is a requirement to payout I think more than 90% of your earnings in dividends well we have a company like ATC which has got a very-very healthy amount of growth in investments. If that company would have to payout say 90%+ in dividends they are going have to be very regularly in a position where they have to raise equity and I am not sure that that would be a good thing necessarily, a good position to be in. So that would a concern that I would have.", "A second concern is how exactly would the provision for income taxes for that company be treated in FERC rate making. And so one of the benefits which you get with the REIT as you only have a single level of taxation, right? Well, I am not sure how you keep that benefit relative to our current structure if you have to give all that provision for income tax benefit back the customers. So at a high levels those would be the two concerns that I would have about the REIT structure but again Tim, you know if it ended up but at some point that was adventurous and certainly be very open to another structure, hopefully that make sense.", "Tim Winter - Gabelli & Co.", "Yes it does, thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett", "You are welcome, Tim.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS", "Gale?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Hi Julian, how are you doing?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS", "Dandy.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Glad to hear that.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS", "Excellent. So let me cut back to that last question little bit and ask a little bit of a different ways. So there is the cost to capital is getting a bit competitively, how are you all feeling in your ability to compete for those planned acquisitions in the state and specifically I\u2019d be curious do you feel like you have any incumbent advantage as being in the state synergies or otherwise that would allow you to kind of outcompete anyone else who might be looking at those assets?", "Allen Leverett", "So your question is about the state power plant, it\u2019s not about ATC?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS", "Indeed.", "Gale E. Klappa", "My guess is that minor movements in the cost of capital are not going to be a major impediment or a major benefit one way or the another. If the state does move forward with the selling the state owned steam and generating plants, I think they are going to be looking obviously for us competitive prices they can get but they are also going to be looking for the type of experience that I think we bring to the table. Again, these plants are providing pretty essential services to places like state owned hospitals to places like all the state capital, all the major universities and the system in Wisconsin and so I think there are going to be other factors, other than just pure price that will play into the winning bidder if the process does go forward. So experience and a track record are being able to operate these types of plants to improve the operations of the plants and to add environmental upgrade on time and on budget, I am confident it would a factor here.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS", "Excellent and then another high level conversation, coal rail deliveries continuing to hear commentary from other folks, where do you guys stand on that, anything to add to the mix?", "Gale E. Klappa", "Yes, we will let Allan talk about how tight things are right now.", "Allen Leverett", "Yes, most of our deliveries are from the Union Pacific although we do have a percentage wise a small amount from the Burlington Northern and a small amount from the Norfolk southern and we have had a lot of challenges really with all the railroads this year but particularly with the Burlington Northern. Some of that stuff is in their control, a lot of it is out of their control for example they had a lot of flooding of some the lines earlier this year but from inventory standpoint our coal inventories are pretty tight right now. We are not up to the levels that we would like them to be and we are not yet on the path to getting the levels that we want to be at in late September. So we certainly have and had to curtail operations of our plants. You may have seen some, in fact there was a news article this morning that a utility in Wisconsin is saying that they might actually have to shut down one of their coal plants because of the bad inventory situation. So it certainly not a level that would calls curtailment but it\u2019s something that I am focusing very much on with our group in terms of coal deliveries and it\u2019s something we would be happy to give you another update on when we have our call in October.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS", "Excellent. Just cutting back to ATC, specifically, I'd be curious, any comments of late on both the competitive FERC process, there've been some tweaks in MISO. Do you feel better about the FERC 1000 process and then separately any commentary of late on the New England case as it relates to ATC?", "Allen Leverett", "I guess no change really on our view of the competitive. This is the order of 1,000 process I mean of course within our traditional footprint within Wisconsin and the UP of Michigan we still have right of first refusal on non-multi value project. So that\u2019s still there, we feel good about that and we feel good about our ability to compete for multi-value projects. But not a lot to add really on the process out east with the FERC ROE review, you know Julian the range of numbers that we had heard thrown out at the FERC low end was 10.57 return high end I believe it was 11 and three quarters and that compares to a current 12.2 at ATC so on a worse case basis, if ATC were taken all the way down to 10.57 that would be about a $0.04 per share impact on the combined company. So if you looked at the WEC Energy Group with the 60% ownership and ATC that would be about $0.04 impact at the low end, at the higher end 11 and three quarters it would be $0.01 a share. So still relatively nominal impacts but it\u2019s something will \u2013 it\u2019s not decided at this point and certainly.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "Presumably you go back and get riders on top of that? ", "Gale E. Klappa", "Well that\u2019s uncertain. You are talking about incentives?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "Yes, sorry incentives.", "Gale E. Klappa", "I don\u2019t believe so.", "Allen Leverett", "Well ATC has not gotten the incentive adder but they have gotten things like a full quip in rate base approach. So we traditionally have not gotten the \u2013 I will call it the incentive ROC which is one of the reasons why I think, we at least have shot that maintaining the 12 because we were never getting the incentive level.", "Gale E. Klappa", "And never asking for them really.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS", "Right, absolutely. Great, well thank you very much.", "Gale E. Klappa", "Thank you very much. Well, ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. Colleen Henderson will be available at our Investor Relations office, and her direct line is (414) 221-2592. Thanks, again, everybody.

Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Analysts", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call to review the 2015 Third Quarter Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statement, factors described in WEC Energy Group's and Integrys Holding's latest Form 10-Ks and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for the third quarter. This, of course, is our first full quarter as a newly combined company. We formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. I'll update you on our progress as a new company in just a moment.", "But first as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President for Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.", "We also have one new member of our senior team with us today, Bill Guc. Bill is our new Vice President and Controller. He has more than 20 years of solid experience in our industry. Prior to the acquisition, he served as Treasurer of Integrys. Bill, welcome aboard.", "Turning now to the third quarter, and I'd like to remind you that we're reporting our legacy Wisconsin Energy results only through the remainder of 2015. So the financial results and the guidance that we'll be discussing have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition.", "Pat will review our results in detail in just a few minutes. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $0.61 a share for the third quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. We delivered strong results through an unusual pattern of summer weather, a cool July, a cool August, followed by an unseasonably warm September.", "Taking a quick look at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in September, well below the national average and the lowest rate of unemployment we've seen here since back in April of 2001. And in the latest survey of the climate for business, Wisconsin was ranked the 12th best state for business by Chief Executive Magazine. This ranking represents a huge leap forward since 2010, when the state came in at 41st.", "In this year's third quarter, residential use of electricity surged by 11.5% compared to last year's abnormally cool summer. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment grew slightly with electricity use rising by 1.6% over the third quarter of a year ago. And deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines rose by 0.6% in the quarter.", "Several sectors continued to show strength including food processing, printing and to Mrs. Robinson (4:12), plastics. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving 6,000 more electric customers and 10,000 more natural gas customers today than we were a year ago.", "Now, I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighed it against our three important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. And after considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all three criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would be largely credit-neutral. And third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate.", "And, of course, over the past year, a number of similar deals have been announced, several as you know, in just the past few months. We're pleased that the metrics for our transaction compare very favorably to these recent announcements.", "We also see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we'll incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline the operations and reduce costs.", "WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America and one of the 15th largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with significant opportunities for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest.", "Now, let's touch on some of the key financial measures for the new company. For starters, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt was 2.21% annually, an outstanding result and clearly lower than we had expected.", "So, for 2016, we now project growth in earnings per share for the combined company to be in the range of 6% to 8%. 6% to 8% earnings growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy standalone delivers earnings of $2.72 a share this year. For the longer term, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance.", "And on the subject of infrastructure upgrades, you may recall that we originally projected capital spending for the combined company in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year for the remainder of the decade and actually beyond. Now, about 120 days into the company, as we look at the spectrum of projects that need to be addressed to deliver industry-leading reliability, we're seeing even stronger investment opportunities. And in the latter part of the decade, our capital investments could range above $1.5 billion a year. With the few other minor changes to our estimates, we continue to project longer term earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% a year range and we're comfortable at the midpoint of that range.", "Lastly, a reminder about our dividend policy. In June, our board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.4575 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. You may recall this was our second dividend increase during 2015. In total, we've raised the dividend by 17.3% this year. Going forward, we're targeting as you may have heard us say a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. Looking forward, we expect to return to our normal pattern of dividend action. Management typically brings the dividend proposal to the board in January of each year and we would expect to do so in January of 2016.", "Now, I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing some of our operational highlights in the past quarter. First, I'm pleased to report that just two weeks ago We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth year in a row. And in recent national studies of large utility systems, We Energies is ranked in the top quartile of the Midwest for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was ranked number two in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities.", "We're also making progress on the Accelerated Main Replacement Project at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you recall, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines over the next 20 years. Some of those pipes ladies and gentlemen literally date back to the days of Abraham Lincoln. One of our most immediate and important goals is to improve the management and the performance of this project.", "Since we closed the acquisition, we put in place an entirely new senior leadership team at Peoples, and we built an in-house construction management group with extensive project experience. They determined that the best approach for the Main Replacement program in Chicago is a fresh start. So over the past 100 days, we've transitioned the management of the project from an outside contractor to our experienced in-house team. We've also engaged a nationally known firm to help us conduct an independent review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. We expect to submit this review and our recommendations to the Illinois Commerce Commission by the end of November. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will ensure that Chicagoans will have a safe, modern, natural gas delivery system that they deserve.", "Then on the natural gas distribution side of our business in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to announce that our West Central Gas pipeline project is now complete and, as of November 1, in service. This was the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in company history. 85-mile line addresses reliability concerns and allows us to add a significant number of customers in the areas where propane use is the heaviest. The project came in on time and actually better than budget at just under $130 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "On the power generation side of our business, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year in fuel cost, depending on the blend.", "We're working now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site and the first capital improvements inside the plant began in September during a planned outage for one of the two units. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of next year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas is now more than 97% complete with only tuning and just punch list items remaining for the project. So our conversion costs will be $60 million to $62 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the work at the Valley Plant on time and on budget within the next 30 days.", "We also continue to make good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity that will meet current federal standards.", "Overall, the project is on time and on budget with approximately 60% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of 2016 and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Looking ahead, we continue to see significant investment opportunities as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. We plan to provide you, as we promised, with more details on our capital investment plans for the next 10 years at the EEI Conference in just a few days.", "Turning to our transmission business, WEC Energy Group, I would remind you, is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. And as you may have seen, ATC recently updated its 10-year capital plan. The plan has slightly lower growth in the near term, but it calls for ATC to invest $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. This latest projection is up from the previous 10-year plan. That previous plan, as you recall, had an investment ranging from $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.", "On a final note, we've completed our evaluation of the compressed natural gas business that we inherited with the acquisition of Integrys. That business is known as Trillium CNG. We've determined that the enterprise has value, but does not fit our focus on our core regulated business. As a result, we're now seeking a new owner for Trillium.", "So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times, filled with opportunity for our company, and we believe we have a very bright future ahead.", "Now, for more details on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?", "J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 third quarter Wisconsin Energy standalone adjusted earnings were $0.61 a share. That compares to adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger.", "To facilitate comparisons with last year's third quarter, my discussion of results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys company and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. We will continue this practice for the remainder of 2015.", "First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Third quarter adjusted consolidated operating income was $262.2 million as compared with adjusted income of $249.1 million in 2014. That's an improvement of $13.1 million.", "Starting with Utility Energy, adjusted operating income in the third quarter totaled $168.5 million for 2015, an improvement of $10.1 million from the third quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, weather helped our earnings by $27.6 million. We had a warmer than normal September in 2015 and a very cool third quarter in 2014. We were also helped by $12 million of improved fuel recoveries and $10.1 million from the impact of the 2015 rate case.", "On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $36 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefits costs. And we also saw increased depreciation expense of $3.6 million associated with higher capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $10.1 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter last year.", "Our non-utility operating income was $93.2 million, which is $1.2 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our adjusted corporate and other improved slightly by $1.8 million over the previous year. Taking these changes together, you arrive at Wisconsin Energy's third quarter adjusted operating income of $262.2 million. This is a $13.1 million improvement over the third quarter of 2014.", "During the third quarter of this year, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $17.6 million, a decline of $400,000 compared to the same period in the prior year. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. These earnings only reflect Wisconsin Energy's standalone share of ATC's results. Other income net increased by $900,000, driven by higher AFUDC, and our adjusted net interest expense increased by $700,000, primarily because of higher utility debt levels.", "Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $4 million for the quarter. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective tax rate for the calendar year will be between 37% and 38%. WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% for 2015. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $138.2 million, or $0.61 a share for the third quarter of 2015.", "Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group exclusively on a GAAP basis and, thus, this includes three months of result from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company.", "During the first nine months of 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flow totaled $1.073 billion, which is a $39 million improvement over the first nine months of 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage.", "Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $100 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014.", "Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, 2015 is 50.3%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of the WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "For comparison purposes, the sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual third quarter retail deliveries rose by 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries increased by 4.4%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again excluding iron ore mines, were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014.", "Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries rise by 1.4%, and as Gale mentioned, actual residential deliveries rose by 11.5%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries fell by 0.7%. Actual deliveries rose by 1.6%. And in the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2015 fell by 8.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries rose by 0.6%.", "Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation dropped 0.4% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation were down 6.7% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year.", "Moving to other items of interest. In September of 2015, Wisconsin Gas issued a $200 million, 10-year bond at a coupon of 3.53%. In part, this new bond is replacing $125 million bond with a coupon of 5.2% that comes due in December.", "Turning now to our 2015 earnings forecast. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to guide based on adjusted standalone earnings for Wisconsin Energy. And again, for your reference, adjusted earnings exclude the results of Integrys, exclude the impacts of the acquisition and adjust for the additional shares that were issued as part of the acquisition.", "Wisconsin Energy's adjusted earnings through the third quarter are $2.10 per share. Taking into account the impact of a relatively warm October as we enter the heating season and assuming normal weather for the rest of the quarter, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share. Thus, the 2015 adjusted earnings forecast for Wisconsin Energy is $2.72 a share. At $2.72, Wisconsin Energy's regulated utilities will earn at or near their allowed rates of return. So again, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share.", "Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance for 2016. As Gale mentioned, we forecast earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 6% to 8% off a projected base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in the range from $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share.", "And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Terrific. Pat, thank you. Overall, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And now we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jonathan. How are you today? Well, Jonathan, I know it's tough.", "J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP", "Or muted.", "Operator", "And Jonathan, please make sure your line is not on mute.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "First-time caller, long-time listener I think. All right. Why don't we go to the next call?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "How's your mute button, Julien?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon. I'm still here.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good. How are you doing?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Quite well. Thank you. Perhaps just to kick off the conversation, the comment on the latter part of the decade, around the $1.5 billion, could you, one, elaborate around what would be driving that? What would the investment be? Where would it be oriented? And then also confirm for us, would that require equity or is the balance sheet in a sufficient place to deal with the incremental capital?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "First of all, let me just reiterate, no expectation of additional equity, period. And then, in terms of the types of projects that we're seeing, we'll give you some really granular detail at the EEI Conference on the 10-year capital spending and on the uptick that we're seeing in the latter part of the decade.", "But let me just say, in general, we're seeing additional requirements, additional capital spending for upgrades and expansion particularly with natural gas in Wisconsin, and for that matter, in Minnesota. So, they're really infrastructure projects; they're the kinds of things we have been talking about. But as we looked across \u2013 as I mentioned, across the spectrum of projects now with the new combined company, we're really seeing infrastructure needs that are going to drive the capital spending higher.", "Now, if you recall, as we made the acquisition, we indicated that we would \u2013 our number one priority, if there were legitimate needed projects, would be to deploy some of our positive free cash flow to that type of investment. So, basically, what we're saying is that over the course of the last 120 days, as we've really refined our estimates and looked at the spectrum of projects, we're seeing higher capital spend out in those years, largely delivery networks, a lot of it gas.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Excellent. And then, let me cut back, and I know this is a little preempting next week a bit, but you talk about the fresh start, to use your words, does that impact the timing of the CapEx on the people side of the business, and perhaps what drove you to come to that conclusion? Can you elaborate a little bit on what exactly that means?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The answer is certainly for this year and for the near term, I wouldn't expect any change in the capital projections for Peoples Gas.", "And from the standpoint \u2013 and let me explain. There are only so many streets you can dig up in Chicago at one time. So in essence, we are physically limited as to how much progress you can make in any given year in terms of the gas-main replacement program of those 2,000 miles of pipes under the streets of Chicago. So that \u2013 I mean, there's a governing factor that is driven mostly by just the physical capability of how many streets can you dig up and repair. That's number one.", "Number two, related to the fresh start, I mean, as you may recall, there was a Commission-mandated audit of the management of the program. It was a rather critical audit. The prior management had outsourced the management of this project, and we really felt like bringing in an experienced construction management team was very important to the future of the project and to managing that project well.", "And that team has looked at the project controls and all of the other issues that they found, and that's why we've decided to go back with a fresh start, with a whole new bottoms-up analysis, and you will see when we file publicly on November 30 what our long-term cost projections are and what our immediate priorities will be.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Excellent. Thank you all. See you soon.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Look forward to it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "How are you doing, Jim.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "I'm good. How are you, Gale?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're good.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hey, I'm looking for some Bucks tickets. Know anyone who could get me some? Okay. On to more important topics. First thing, besides the Bucks, Trillium book value and the tax basis and what your expected uses of proceeds are?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll talk to Allen about that, but I believe the book value is around $130 million.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. That's basically similar?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, it's probably three-quarters of that.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. Switching over to cash flow, I'm not trying to become a debt analyst, but the \u2013 and you guys over the years have been very helpful with earnings guidance and dividend expectations, but less so on the cash flow side of things. So when you look at your FFO productions, can you just book-end how much of that FFO comes from, say, Power the Future, and then if you add in Illinois, relative to the total FFO amount?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Jim, we don't have that kind of detail in the room with us today. I mean, we can...", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We can, off line, kind of give you some broad estimates, but we just don't have \u2013 I mean, we want to give you the right kind of answers. We just don't have that specificity in the room with us today. The entire brain thrust is here, but we don't have that kind of specificity.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. And then are you seeing any \u2013 well, we'll talk about that offline. But as a follow-up to that, are you seeing any calls on your cash in the near term to intermediate term? Intermediate being defined as, say, two years to three years. This year, you did your pension contribution for the first time. Is there any changes with respect to like deferred taxes and the like?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, obviously, the short answer is no. However, there's going to be a lot of developments particularly towards the end of the year, and specifically related to whether or not Congress renews or extends bonus depreciation.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Right.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "For many companies including ours, that's a very big number. Now, from a cash standpoint, we have not factored in the potential uptick of bonus appreciation, again, from a cash standpoint in 2016 or beyond. We're just very conservative from that standpoint. We're not going to make any assumptions until we see the legislation actually signed and in place. But those are very \u2013 those could be \u2013 that could be a very big swing.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "No, I get it. Okay. And then the last question still on this debt analyst path, fixed debt versus variable debt. If I did my math correctly on the combined entity, the debt is basically entirely fixed that you have. I think there's a few resets that switch over to variable in the next three years to five years. But nothing really to get worked up about in the event that Fed finally decides to start moving rates. Is that correct?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, gosh, yeah. I mean, the lion's share of our debt is absolutely fixed. You are correct. There are a couple of hybrid issuances, one at legacy WEC, one at Integrys, that could switch over in 2017 and 2016, 2017 for us, 2017 for legacy WEC, 2016 for Integrys that could switch over. But they switch over even if the Fed raised rates a little at incredibly low levels, like LIBOR plus 2.12%. I mean, so they're very competitive, if they do \u2013 when they do switch over.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Super. That's all I had. Thanks, guys. See you in Florida.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Look forward to it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, good afternoon, Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hello, Jonathan. Did that mute button sick?", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "There's some rumor I might have fallen asleep here.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We were that scintillating in the call, huh?", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I thought I needed to refute that.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "How are you doing, Jonathan, other than those naps are wonderful.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. So, one \u2013 just a couple of small things, your O&M, as we think about pro forma and where it came in, in the quarter. Is $500 million a quarter a decent run rate expectation, just as we're wrestling with the pro forma model?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're looking at each other here. It's within the ballpark, maybe a hair high, but it's within the ballpark.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And then, we have one other. Just as we think about TEG in fourth quarter and try unfolding that in, we're likely to see a dilution in Q4, or possibly accretion given the winter waiting?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I wouldn't think you'd see dilution in Q4, but remember, one of the reasons why, Jonathan, we're focusing on legacy WEC performance for the remainder of the year is there are \u2013 as we go through purchase price accounting, as we go through transition costs, as we go through any remaining acquisition costs, which should be very small at this point, there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of one-time things that affect the Integrys performance financially from a reporting standpoint in the fourth quarter.", "So, again, we think it's almost fruitless to try to give you a GAAP number, and to concentrate on the GAAP number for the Integrys performance in the fourth quarter. Having said that, January 1, 2016 is combined company rock and roll.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So, from 2016, you're going to give \u2013 you're not going to keep doing this through the year after the close or anything like that?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely not. You will see combined results. That's what we will focus on. That's what we report. And Jonathan, that's what our earnings guidance that Pat just gave you for 2016 is based on.", "Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Good. Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much, and thanks for the insights.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Jonathan.", "J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP", "(35:14).", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Hey. How are you doing?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're great. How about you, Paul?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm managing...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Now, the last time I asked about wonderful and award-winning, and you weren't quite there.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Well, I'm always striving. Always striving (35:34).", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Okay. We'll try to be helpful.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I want to turn to the accelerated main replacement program in Illinois.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So now it looks like the projections are that it'll be considerably more CapEx, I would assume. Could you give us a flavor for how much we should be seeing annually that being driven by and just sort of the causation that we're seeing there and also the rate impact, I guess, cumulatively over this period of time? I mean, it just seems like a lot that we're reading about.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. And I appreciate you're asking the question. Let me clarify two or three very key points here. First of all, this was designed initially to be a 20-year program. When we walked into the door after the acquisition, there had been an estimate, a revised estimate made by the previous outsourced firm that the cost might rise to as much as, say, $8 billion over the 20-year period.", "I don't think the previous management had confidence in that estimate. We did not have confidence in that estimate. That's why we brought in our experienced team and another outside nationally known firm to basically take a complete bottoms-up review.", "Having said that, the legislation that enables this program to move forward with current and appropriate cost recovery caps the amount of capital spending on this program at roughly $250 million a year. From what I have seen personally over the last 120 days, it would be extremely difficult. I mentioned earlier there are only so many streets you can dig up, and you can't do a lot of this work in the dead of winter.", "So, from a weather standpoint and just a sheer congestion and major city standpoint, I don't think you could technically just physically spend much more than about $250 million a year anyway. So, I wouldn't make the assumption. I think it'd be an inappropriate assumption that we would be spending much more on that advanced main replacement program in any given year than $250 million to $300 million.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Does that help, Paul?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "It does help. And I guess in terms of that $8 billion number which clearly you guys are reviewing, I mean, when do you think we're going to get or when will you guys get a better idea about what the \u2013 would you be able to share with us what you think the actual number will be? And I'm just wondering, I mean, you talk about digging up streets and stuff. I mean, there are some things that you hear about and which you could do things without digging up the street, if you follow me, in terms of like liner or stuff and what have you, I don't know. I'm just wondering whether or not...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're going to try fracking down there.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Well, that will solve some transportation issues.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That'll solve the problem, exactly. I mean, there are \u2013 there's something called keyhole technology which we are experimenting with right now. But having said that, just the sheer logistics, I would still believe that given the weather constraints and the sheer logistics, we're probably physically capped at the $250 million to $300 million a year.", "Now, you asked, when are we going to see more specific estimates? Well, the date is November 30. We've promised the Illinois Commerce Commission that we will file on November 30, our longer-term cost estimates for the 20-year period. Now, as you know, trying to estimate precisely the cost of the construction program that is going to span 20 years, you know the only thing we're going to be is wrong.", "So, we will probably give a range of values. We'll probably have a low case, a medium case, and a high case. And then I would expect that what we will really focus on is, okay, those are projections but what are we going to do in the next three years to make the most progress in getting that natural gas delivery system as safe and efficient as possible?", "I think you'll see a broad range for a lengthy period of time, so low case, high case, medium case. And then we will really focus on what we plan to do in the next three years and what the cost of that is, and what the progress will be. And all of that look forward to November 30.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Now in terms of rate impact, and I think \u2013 I'm glad you asked that question. The legislation basically caps at that $250 million to $300 million a year. Caps consumer rate increases at an average of 4%. But it's very important to understand what that 4% is based on. That 4% is based on what we call base rates. So, base rates make up like less than a third of a residential customer's gas bill. The rest is the commodity. So we're not talking about tremendous rate pressure here. We're talking about 4% off of \u2013 we're talking about basically 4% on a third of the total customer bill each year.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. And then I guess just, when you say the 20 years, I mean this project's been going on for some time. I mean...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Not really.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "...or it hasn't? Because I mean, so we're not talking 2030, or are we talking \u2013 what is the date and time we're talking about I guess?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Officially, I mean there was some work done I think in 2012 and 2013, but basically under the legislation, really March 2014. I think that the hope was that a lot could be accomplished by 2030. Again, we're taking a hard, fresh bottoms-up look at this, but we're talking about a very extensive period of time.", "And the one thing \u2013 and I've spent a lot of time personally in Chicago with the team over the last couple of months, and the one thing that is very clear to me is that from the Mayor's office to the common council to the Illinois Commerce Commission, there is outstanding and common agreement that this program has to move forward. It has to be done efficiently. It has to be managed well, but Chicago has to have the modern efficient system that it deserves.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're more than welcome, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Rock and roll, Michael.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, Gale. Congrats on a good quarter. Real quickly, just when you think about transmission spend and the CapEx change at ATC, can you frame how much of the near-term, meaning the next two to three years, has changed relative to what was prior \u2013 previously in the public domain?", "J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP", "There's very little change. I mean, when you look at 10-year plan to 10-year plan, Michael, there's really very little change in the frontend. I'm sure you've seen these \u2013 if you look at the 10-year estimates, the previous estimates were in the range of $3.3 million to $3.9 million. The new estimates are in the range of $3.7 million to $4.5 million.", "So over a 10-year period, they're talking about somewhat more capital spending. But in the very short term, which I think was the source of your question, two years to three years, not seeing a heck of a lot of change, which is kind of what you would expect, because these projects take a long time to get approved and then they're typically multi-year in nature.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And when you think about the next two to three, three to four years at ATC, how much of those projects have already received siting, already received permitting, are kind of close to shovel-ready or are virtually shovel-ready now?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Well, I would say anything two years out is virtually...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Done, yeah.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "...is already \u2013 you've gone through the approvals, because again going back to what I said, the projects are typically multi-year. And then as you get farther and farther out obviously, less and less would already have gone through the regulatory process.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Allen is exactly right. If you think about the gestation period on some of these larger projects, they can be \u2013 from conceptual, design to approval, they could be five years. So, I think you could clearly conclude what Allen is saying that the next couple of two, three years, virtually everything they've included is largely through the approval process.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And when you're looking at demand on the gas utility side, how different do you see demand, or how much do you expect demand to differ in Wisconsin relative to Illinois and some of the other Integrys service areas?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would expect, given normal weather conditions, demand in Wisconsin and Minnesota and, to some extent, Michigan to grow more strongly than Illinois simply because there's just not a lot of propane use in the City of Illinois. By contrast, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota are three of the 10 heaviest using \u2013 heaviest propane using states in the U.S.", "And, for example, in Minnesota, recently, there was legislation passed that in essence reduces the upfront hook-up cost for customers to switch over to the natural gas delivery network that allows more of those capital costs to be basically put into rate base as opposed to the individual customer having to pay more or hooking into the system, and that was done because of the very significant concern in Minnesota about what happened in 2014 during the polar vortex with propane supplies. So, we would expect Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, in terms of gas demand and growth in gas customers, to be stronger.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome. See you in Florida, Michael.", "Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Sounds great.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hello, Paul. How are you today?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Well, Gale. Yourself?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're doing well. (46:04).", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Oh, yeah. You got me, I'm not going to go there, okay? Now, that you've had kind of a few months to digest the transaction, can you kind of give us an update on maybe what you're seeing as potential synergy opportunities?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me start by saying that we really have not had any major negative surprises. Essentially, I think we did a good job of due diligence in what we're seeing in terms of the best practices, in terms of driving costs down, in terms of more efficient operations. I think all the potential we saw is really there. So, I would first say the one upside for the past 120 days is the clear identification of infrastructure upgrades beyond what we thought in our due diligence and that led to what I discussed about the higher capital spending on rate base opportunities here in the latter part of the decade.", "In terms of cost reductions, remember this transaction was far more about growth than about cost reductions. The cost reductions we have estimated basically will be needed in any given year to help us make sure we earn our allowed rates of return. So, again, I don't want to make \u2013 I want to make sure that no one is thinking that there are going to be huge cost savings that are then going to somehow result in earnings above the allowed rates of return. That's not the plan, and that's not what we're seeing.", "I will say this, though, I think long term, there will be significant and tangible savings. There's no question about that. And even in Wisconsin, let me reiterate what we said earlier, and that is over the next 10 years, I see in a combination of capital cost savings and O&M savings, at least $1 billion of cost savings. Again, that's a combination of capital and O&M. And the first tangible result of that was when we were able to \u2013 with the Commission's approval, we were able to take off the table the need for Wisconsin Public Service to build a Fox 3, which was a combined cycle natural gas unit that had been planned. And that's a $600 million investment that we can postpone for a very long time. So that's a tangible savings for customers right there.", "We will see, over time, for example, in just having to build only one, and it's being built by Integrys right now, only one new major customer information and billing system, the project is called ICE, and those projects are about $120 million, $150 million a pop. Well, we're only going to need to build one of them, and that's being built right now. So, you can see all across our operations how we can drive cost savings over time. I hope that responds to your question.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "It does. And can you \u2013 for a while, it seemed as though mining frac sand had some upside to it. What's the status of that industry?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We have about 110 frac sand, mining or processing operations in the Western part of Wisconsin. That is up from literally 10, five years ago. So that industry literally has just burgeoned over the course of the past five years, 10 to 110. Now, those 110 operations because of the price of oil, and lesser demand for frac sand, those operations are down. I think we're seeing about \u2013 of those we are serving today with natural gas, about an 11% decline this year in their natural gas demand. However, we were not serving anywhere near all of those 110 operations because we didn't have the infrastructure backbone to support that.", "I mentioned earlier, that our West Central Gas expansion project is now complete; that 85-mile line. That will allow us to sign up more of those operations. So, we're going to see growth in the therms that we deliver to that industry in Western Wisconsin over time, simply because we weren't serving that many of them during the boom times. As I said, they are down about 11% in terms of therms now, but we're going to be serving more of them, now that we have completed the West Central line.", "In fact, one of the major frac sand operators has just signed a contract with us to switch over from propane to natural gas. And remember, the ones we're not serving now are basically drying their sand with propane and their preference would be to move to less costly, more predictable natural gas. Does that respond to your question?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Perfectly. And then, lastly, just on the fresh look on main replacement, which way do you think that $8 billion number goes?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "When we have a firm number and file it on November 30, you'll be the first to know.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I look forward to your call.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you again for taking part.

Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Operator", "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call to review the 2015 Year-End Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statement, factors described in WEC Energy Group's and Integrys Holding's latest Form 10-Ks and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Helane, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2015. As you know, we formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. So today's report reflects two full quarters as a combined company. I'll update our progress on a number of major initiatives in just a moment.", "But first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group and CEO-elect; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.", "Turning now to our 2015 performance, I'd like to remind you that we're focusing on legacy Wisconsin Energy so our financial results have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. And as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $2.73 a share for 2015, that compares with adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014.", "Looking back over the latest year, it was not only a transformational year for our company but a year also of significant achievements. We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth consecutive year. In international studies, We Energies ranked in the top quartile in the Midwest again for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay was ranked number two in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among mid-sized utilities.", "We also reached a milestone for employee safety at We Energies, recording the safest year in more than 115 years of operation. We invested nearly $780 million in our legacy core business with all major projects on time and on budget. And, of course, we closed our acquisition of Integrys to form WEC Energy Group, the leading electric and natural gas utility system in the Midwest with now 4.4 million customers across the region.", "From a financial standpoint, we continued to deliver solid earnings growth. Through disciplined cost control and effective planning, we delivered record earnings in 2015 despite a very warm fourth quarter. In fact, Milwaukee experienced the warmest December in its history, surpassing the former record set way back in the day in 1877.", "Taking a look at the state's economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate ended the year at 4.3%, well below the national average and the December statistics show that more Wisconsinites were employed than during any other month in history. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68%, which is more than 5 points better than the national rates. In addition, Wisconsin added 4,000 manufacturing jobs from November 2014 to November of 2015 despite some very challenging conditions for manufacturers.", "In light of these challenges, use of electricity by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. In 2015, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 0.4% less electricity than they did in 2014. However, and this is an important point, we did see improvement in several significant sectors of the state's economy including food processing, printing, paper production and plastics.", "In addition, we continued to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving approximately 6,500 more electric customers and more than 8,500 more customers on the gas side of our business today than we were a year ago.", "I'm also pleased with our post-acquisition work over the past several months as we've begun to operationalize the new WEC Energy Group. As I've said before, we see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach, and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We're leveraging these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders. And with our proven leadership team, we're incorporating best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and to reduce costs.", "WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with real opportunity for growth.", "Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest and our plan calls for the combined company to grow earnings per share by 6% to 8% in 2016.", "Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact of bonus depreciation, a subject I know you're very interested in. As you know, in December, Congress passed a tax law that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we'll receive approximately $1 billion of cash benefits from this extension of bonus depreciation, with most of the benefits coming in 2016 and in 2017. First, let me say though, that we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any material impact on earnings this year. And over the longer term we have significant flexibility to bring forward reliability projects that will clearly benefit customers.", "The additional cash benefits will allow us to fund a strong backlog of infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability. And if the Clean Power plan moves forward on the proposed timetable, our incremental cash flows could well be needed to support additional investments in renewable energy or new natural gas generation for our fleet.", "Of course, we also have the option to further deleverage the holding company. So bottom line, for the longer term, beyond 2016, we continue to see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% a year. As a reminder, our current 10-year investment plan is primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We expect that more than half of our capital investments, about $800 million a year roughly, will be dedicated to the gas delivery business, providing safer and more reliable infrastructure and extending our gas distribution lines to customers across the Midwest.", "We also plan to invest approximately $400 million a year to upgrade and harden our electric delivery networks. Now, the primary risks associated with these core distribution projects are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the work. But the work is no less important than the mega projects we've completed over the years. Our focus now on renewing our distribution networks is essential to maintaining our status as one of the nation's most reliable utilities.", "We also expect the remaining investment, approximately $300 million a year, will be focused on our generating fleet and on what we call corporate infrastructure. To be clear, however, these projections did not include any capital that would be needed for compliance with the Clean Power Plan.", "Turning now to other developments, I'm pleased to report that the conversion of the Valley Power Plant near Downtown Milwaukee from coal to natural gas was completed in the fourth quarter on time and on budget. The total investment was approximately $60 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "We're also making very good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Overall, the Twin Falls project is on time and on budget with approximately 82% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of this year, and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "Next, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibilities at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. But given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save customers anywhere between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending upon the mix. Work is under way now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site. The larger site should be ready by early next year.", "Also, the first capital investment inside the plant was made on one of the units during a planned outage this past fall. We also plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of this year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.", "We're also moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you'll recall, this is one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines and I'm pleased to report that over the past six months, we've taken significant steps to improve the management and performance of this project, which is now approximately 18% complete. We engaged a nationally recognized engineering firm that helped us conduct an extensive independent review of the work plan and the long-term cost estimates.", "And as part of our fresh start in Chicago, we filed a plan on November 30 that lays out our top priorities for the next three years. The components of the three-year plan include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, a projected investment of between $250 million and $280 million a year, and regular updates to the Illinois Commerce Commission and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed of our progress.", "In assessing the plan that we filed on November 30, the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled a series of six workshops to be held by the end of March. Two of the workshops are already complete. While the engineering, fieldwork and cost recovery continue, these workshops are bringing together all of the stakeholders to review the scope, the schedule and the long-term cost of the plan with a focus on safety and reliability. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will provide Chicagoans with a safe modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve.", "Moving now to our transmission business, our electric transmission business, as you know, WEC is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. ATC's capital plan calls for investment of $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.", "Turning now to our dividend policy, on January 21, as you may have read, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate is now $1.98 a share. Going forward, we're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with the growth in earnings per share.", "On a final note, as I mentioned on one of our previous calls, we've been seeking a new owner for the Trillium compressed natural gas business. You'll recall that this business came to us as part of the Integrys transaction. We sold part of the business in late November of last year, and very recently, we reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the remaining Trillium assets. This agreement is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review and we're projecting to reach financial close by the end of the first quarter.", "In total, we expect at least $130 million of pre-tax cash proceeds from the combined sales of the Trillium assets. The fair value of Trillium was reflected in our purchase price allocation following the Integrys acquisition and as you know, the earnings on the Trillium business were not significant to our company.", "So, in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity and change for our company. And speaking of change, we recently announced that I'll be retiring as Chief Executive Officer effective May 1. After May 1, I'll continue to serve the company as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and I'm delighted that Allen Leverett will succeed me as Chief Executive. Allen has also been appointed to our board of directors.", "As most of you know, Allen has been a very key contributor to our success since he joined Wisconsin Energy the same year I did back in 2003, first as Chief Financial Officer, then as the leader of our power generation group and most recently as President of the parent firm at our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan utilities. I've known and worked with Allen for more than 20 years.", "Now, I have to tell you he is not quite as fond of breed of financial audit as I am, but the depth of his experience, his management skills and his focus on execution make him the ideal person to lead our company through a time of continuing change in the energy industry. Allen, my congratulations.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Thank you, Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And now for more details on our 2015 performance and our outlook for 2016, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, in 2015, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.73 compared with $2.65 a share for 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger.", "To facilitate comparisons with last year, my discussion of 2015 results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.", "First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2015 was $1.137 billion as compared with $1.125 billion in 2014. That's an increase of $12 million.", "Starting with the Utility Energy segment, the operating income in 2015 totaled $767.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over 2014. On the positive side, we had a $35 million increase in revenues due to the Wisconsin rate order. We also had $10.4 million of improved fuel recoveries and lower O&M cost, in part driven by lower benefits cost and reduced maintenance expense in the fourth quarter, decreased expenses by $10.2 million.", "On the downside, we estimate that our electric and gas margins decrease by $35.3 million, driven by warmer fourth quarter weather. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the second warmest in the history of We Energies.", "In addition, depreciation expense rose by $16.8 million with additional capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $3.5 million increase in adjusted Utility operating income in 2015 as compared with 2014.", "Our Non-Utility Energy operating income was $373.4 million, which is $5.4 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our Corporate and Other segment showed an operating loss of $4.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Taking the changes for these segments together, you'd arrive at $12 million increase in adjusted operating income.", "During 2015, earnings from Wisconsin Energy's investment in American Transmission Company totaled $54.5 million, which was an $11.5 million decline from 2014. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. ATC re-evaluated those reserves in the fourth quarter and decided to increase them.", "Other income net increased by $24.3 million, driven in large part by second quarter asset sales. Higher AFUDC, driven primarily by our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin, also contributed.", "2015 net interest expense increased by $2 million. This was driven by slightly higher long-term debt, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $2.7 million for 2015. Our higher taxable income was slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate. Looking forward, we expect WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38.5% for 2016. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $620.9 million or $2.73 per share for 2015.", "Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group on a GAAP basis, which includes six months results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flow totaled $1.294 billion, which is a $95 million improvement over 2014. A major driver of the improvement was the inclusion of legacy Integrys companies for six months, which added both to depreciation and deferred income taxes. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $41 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014.", "Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2015. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "For comparison purposes, the annual sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual 2015 retail deliveries fell by 1.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries fell by 0.8%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again excluding the iron ore mines, also fell by 0.8% compared to 2014.", "Looking at the individual customer segments now, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries fall by 1.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell by 2%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normal deliveries rose by 0.2%. Actual deliveries fell by 0.1%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2015 fell by 3.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.4%.", "Our 2015 weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 1.5% compared to 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation, were down 11% compared to the polar vortex-driven gas sales in 2014.", "For 2016, we will forecast and discuss delivery results for the State of Wisconsin, our largest segment. Our Wisconsin segment includes the results of both We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. Note that, with decoupling, gas deliveries in Illinois are not as tightly tied to financial results.", "So in Wisconsin, we're forecasting a modest increase of 0.3% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mines. That compares to a 0.1% decline in 2015. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on any significant gains in energy usage by our customers.", "Looking at 2016 by individual customer segments, we expect residential deliveries to decline by 0.1%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts, but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to decline by 0.3%. And in the large commercial and industrial group, we are projecting an increase of 1.2%, excluding the mines. We project 2016 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.5%.", "Turning now to our capital forecast. As Gale mentioned, we expect to invest at least $1.5 billion per year in capital projects, or $15 billion in the next decade. Correspondingly, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in 2016, primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We will continue to evaluate both our short-term and long-term capital investment plans in light of bonus depreciation.", "Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2016. As previously mentioned, we expect earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 6% to 8% off a base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in a range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share.", "Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Taking into account January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related costs. Once again, first quarter guidance for the WEC Energy Group is $0.99 to $1.03 per share.", "And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're suddenly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our shareholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And now, we would like to take the questions. Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Afternoon, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon and congratulations to both of you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Thank you.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Absolutely. So perhaps just...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "(26:12), Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Absolutely. Thank you. Kicking it off here, I'd just be curious, Peoples Gas, just the earned ROEs and expectations into 2016, looks like there could be a nice pick-up there. But I'd be curious if you can elaborate kind of what you're thinking about an earned ROE embedded in that range.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Or what should we be thinking about for that segment?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I am really glad you asked, Julien. Let me first say that for calendar year 2015, the Illinois utilities, Peoples Gas and North Shore, earned their allowed rate of return, which is 9.05% (26.54) and that's exactly what's embedded in our forecast for 2016 earnings guidance. I know you had...", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "All right.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "...questions about whether we could achieve that.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "No, well, there we go. And then secondly, I'd just be curious, in terms of the bonus depreciation, if you can elaborate a little further there. Can you discuss a little bit more what the offsets were for 2016 and how you were able to entirely offset it? And then looking forward a little bit more prospectively here, could you talk about what there too, what are the items adding up in terms of added spend, et cetera, to make it up?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me try to frame that for you, and if any of our guys want to add additional detail, feel free to do so. But for 2016, since there will be no \u2013 basically, there will be no base rate changes for calendar 2016 across our major utilities. We really don't see any immediate type of a hit in terms of bonus depreciation. However, in terms of the cash that we'll be receiving, it has allowed us to pull forward several important infrastructure projects. Really it's not large projects, but it's things like replacement of additional underground lines, substation transformer replacements, et cetera. Virtually all of that is in Wisconsin and that's worth about an additional $100 million that we've identified so far for 2016 just as an example.", "So I think most of the projects that we are looking at that will be able to be funded with the bonus depreciation cash are exactly those types of projects; on our gas delivery networks and on our electric delivery networks, all related to reliability, all related to upgrading, modernizing and hardening for safety purposes.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great, excellent. And then last, just follow-up there if you can, thinking big picture CPP longer term, we've heard a lot of other states talk a lot about adjacencies to Canada and imports. Can you talk a little bit more about the Manitoba Hydro opportunity in the long term and how that fits into your five-year and 10-year CapEx plan?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it really has no impact on the 5-year CapEx plan or really nothing specific in the 10-year CapEx plan. However, and I'll ask Allen to talk about this, if there are going to be more hydro imports from Canada, there clearly would have to be additional transmission built. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Yeah. So, of course, the Manitoba Hydro, we wouldn't actually be an investor, we will be an offtaker of the power. So in terms of a direct investment, we wouldn't have any direct investment in the hydro units themselves. But as Gale mentioned, if you're going to have deliverability and actually be able to affect the generation dispatch in Wisconsin, you'd have to be able to deliver it, so you'd need the electric transmission. But at this point, we certainly don't have a number on what that investment might look like.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Still a bit early. But it is something indeed that you're interested in exploring, correct?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Yeah. I mean, I think it's something \u2013 another item in the toolbox that would help us potentially with compliance.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And to Allen's point, Julien, if we're facing, as a state, in Wisconsin a 41% reduction in CO2 emissions, we're going to need every cost-effective tool we have.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome. Thank you, Julien. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Rock and roll, Jim. How are you?", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "But without Mexican food.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Without Mexican food. Well, you know...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It may change a little bit, Jim.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "So not to quote The Who or anything, but the question really is for Allen. So how would you describe your management style versus Gale's? And what would you say are the nuances in your respective strategic visions for WEC going forward?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, man, this is going to be interesting.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Well, Jim, that's such a long...", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Has your post been paid yet, Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "That's such a long question; I'm going to give you a very short answer. And it's probably easier for me to talk about what won't change, Jim.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "And we talked about a lot of things that will, and Mexican food \u2013 no Mexican food at the staff meetings. But what won't change is really a focus on execution and delivering results. So that's a short answer to your very long conceptual question.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "But that's what won't change.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Let me ask you a second broad topic before I go into a modeling or two question. With respect to growth, what we've seen over the last several weeks from the companies that have been reporting is that not all G is created equal. Can you talk about why your G is standing out and why you're so confident in your 5% to 7% longer term growth rate?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'll take a shot at it. Allen certainly should offer his view. I think the reason we're confident in our 6% to 8% growth in 2016 and then 5% to 7% afterward is essentially the need for the significant capital investments in the kinds of projects that we have embedded in that 10-year plan. Our huge generation projects are behind us by and large. But the kind of reliability upgrades, the kind of modernization that's needed on the natural gas delivery networks and the electric delivery networks, those are essential for reliability going forward. And when we see the significant backlog that we have and, of course, our capital spending doubling with the acquisition of Integrys compared to standalone Wisconsin Energy, the need and the backlog of the projects gives me, at least, very significant confidence in our ability to hit the growth rates. Allen?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Yeah. I guess the only thing I would add, Jim, to Gale's comment, quite a bit of the investment we're looking at is in the natural gas side of the business. So there is a clear need from an infrastructure standpoint. So I think that's something else that you should keep in mind when you look at the longer-term numbers.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And to Allen's point, Jim, it's not just Chicago. We have a significant amount of natural gas delivery network investment in Wisconsin as well. And for that matter, expansions in Minnesota, in Rochester, growth in Michigan with the natural gas utility there. So I think we said earlier that about $800 million a year on average of our $1.5 billion of capital investment will be devoted toward the natural gas delivery business.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. Switching over to a couple financial questions, can you talk broadly about your financing plans for 2016 and 2017 in terms of expected debt issuances, maybe on a net basis? And then talk about your free cash flow expectations over the same period with free cash flow being defined both pre and post dividend?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. We'll let Pat and Scott talk with you specifically. I will say that right now the first thing we have out of the box in 2016, and we announced it earlier this week, is a tender offer for the hybrids or a portion of the hybrids that were outstanding at TEG. It's one of the issues of the hybrids that we have a tender offer for right now. So that's the first refinancing or the first financing opportunity that we have that's underway right now. Pat?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. And them Jim, in 2016, this is actually a pretty light year for us. We only project right now to have two bond offerings, one in Wisconsin Gas probably in the first half of the year, and then at PGL in the second half of the year. So this is \u2013 certainly relative to last year, not a lot going on.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Let me be a bit more straightforward. Do you expect to be free cash flow positive this year, next year?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "No, we do not. We do not expect to be free cash flow positive this year or next year.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "What's the delta versus being free cash?", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "I don't have that number at my fingertips, but part of what Gale said is we're evaluating, and my comments as well, as we evaluate the capital plan, even if I had that number, that would be a little bit in flux as we evaluate how to deploy that bonus depreciation cash we've received. So we can follow up when we kind of frame that up in a little more detail, if you'd like, but I'd rather not wallow around in it, if that's all right.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And Jim, an additional comment on that. Remember, we do not have any need to issue additional equity. So basically, we might be talking about a slight increase in commercial paper or one of these bond offerings that Pat laid out. But we're within the \u2013 I mean, we're basically within the confines of not needing additional equity and maintaining the current type of debt to capital that we've been historically maintaining.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Jim. Thanks for the comments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Greetings, Michael. How are you today?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I'm well. Congrats to both of you, gentlemen.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "A couple of just questions, I want to make sure \u2013 I hopped on a tad bit late, so I want to make sure I understand. You've got your rate case filing coming in Wisconsin in the next couple of months, April-May timeframe I think. Should we imply that given the fact you have extra capital as part of bonus depreciation that the CapEx requirements or the CapEx spends for kind of the two-year period that case will cover, 2017 and 2018, potentially higher than what you kind of disclosed in the EEI-related slide decks given the fact you have a lot more capital available to you at that subsidiary \u2013 or at those subsidiaries?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think certainly because we now have the availability of additional cash through the federal government's extension of bonus depreciation, I mean, yes, we are looking at for the benefit of customers to be able to invest in more modernization than what you saw in our slide deck in terms of the 10-year capital plan. Because as you'll recall, we did not take for granted that there would be an extension of bonus depreciation when we laid out the new 10-year capital plan at the EEI Conference in November. So yes, I think you could expect us to have additional capital investment, again, along the lines of additional upgrading of our natural gas and electricity delivery networks, particularly in Wisconsin. But in light of the fact that this is additional cash coming in, it really would not have any material effect on our rate review.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Meaning as long as the CapEx increase and the bonus D&A impact on rate base are a one-for-one swap.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That is correct. You stated it very well.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And are there enough projects that you don't need to \u2013 that don't have lengthy approval processes where you could make a $400 million to $500 million a year increase in your capital budget for like the 2017-2018 timeframe? And that just seems like a very significant increase. If you're saying that bonus D&A is worth about $1 billion to you, that would be a pretty significant increase to the capital budget. I'm just trying to think about the ability to actually execute that type of CapEx increase.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we don't have $400 million to $500 million a year of additional projects, but I would say to you that looking at our legitimate backlog of investment needs, what we can pull forward is very significant. And then in the back half of that period, remember the period is really 2015 through 2019, in the back half of that period, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, if the proposed time table for the clean power plant compliance stays on track, we may be looking at the need for investment in our fleet either additional renewables, additional natural gas-fired generation. So those could be some fairly large projects in the back half of this period that we're talking about, but certainly in the front half of the period, 2016, 2017-ish. We really are looking at smaller discrete projects, such as additional ability to replace aging underground lines, replace and upgrade substation transformers, more distribution automation, those types of projects. They really don't meet the threshold of a specific approval from any of the regulators.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And this one maybe for Allen. Just trying to think about ATC and the impact bonus depreciation would have on ATC's earnings power and therefore its earnings contribution up to WEC.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Yeah. So I think when Gale talked about, in the prepared remarks, the $1 billion worth of cash from the tax savings, that included in effect our ownership share of ATC. So it's certainly not in addition to that. It's already included in that estimate. As you know, Michael, the transmission projects are pretty long lead time, so I can't see anything at all at or (40:37) ATC's capital budget of 2016 and 2017. But the team at ATC is looking at things that can be pulled into the back half of the period that Gale mentioned, say, in 2018 and 2019, which would allow us or ATC to pull some projects up that are beneficial to customers.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Last one, and somebody asked a little bit of this, but I'm just curious. You issued a lot of very low cost debt at the holding company to pay for Integrys \u2013 to pay for part of the equity component of Integrys. Just curious about how you are thinking about over the next two to three, three to four years, how much of that holding company debt you would like to term out versus how much of that holding company debt you would like to simply take out and reduce the leverage at the holding company level.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Very good question, Michael. And the honest answer to you is, we're going to continue to iterate as we move along. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have additional distribution network projects that we can use the additional cash to very beneficial use for customers. As Allen mentioned, there are maybe some additional transmission investments in the back half of that five-year period. There may be a generation investment because of Clean Power Plan compliance.", "But the other option we have is further deleveraging of the holding company. There will be some deleveraging in the plan to begin with. It just will happen, given our \u2013 the way we've laid out our forecast. But we also have the opportunity to deleverage.", "So what we are going to do as we continue to move forward through this period here is we're going to say, okay, what is the best use of the cash for our customers and shareholders, and put that cash to the best use we can. And what we were trying to do for you is lay out the series of options that we have that will balance going forward. So I can't give you a precise answer at this point in time other than additional beyond the plan deleveraging of the holding company is an option.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, Gale and Allen. Much appreciated.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome. I will you see in a few days, Michael.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I will see you in two weeks, yes.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Greetings, Brian.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi. How are you?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're good. Are you wonderful and award winning today, Brian?", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Just to follow on that last question on the parent debt, when is the first call date? I mean, you'd probably have to pay a premium prior to callable dates, correct?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Are you thinking about the holding company debt, or are you talking...", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, holding company debt.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we got to carve it up. There's multiple debt instruments at the holding company, Brian, between the hybrid. Are you talking specifically the acquisition debt?", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, acquisition debt.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry. The acquisition debt, the first tranche expires at the end of three years, so 2018. So, it was three, five and 10 years, so 2018, 2020 and 2025.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Three, five and 10 years, and then about $300 million of commercial paper.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. And just to be clear, this is embedded in your 5% to 7% EPS CAGR or it's an addition to it? Just how does those moving parts work in terms of the CAGR?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "When you say \u2013 all of that debt is embedded.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "No. I mean, is there assumption for debt reduction of the acquisition debt in the 5% to 7% CAGR?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, we're assuming that \u2013 again, we want to see what kind of flexibility we have, but we'll either retire it or refinance it.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Dan, how are you?", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Good. And congratulations to both of you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Dan, I am so glad you called since this is my last call, and I've been wanting to have a conversation with you about all the advice that I've freely given you about your behavior over the years, and I'm hoping that I've been helpful to you \u2013 improved behavior on your part. I was just thinking, though, with this being my last call, I just wanted to offer you, and you can certainly feel free to think about this, but I just wanted to offer you perhaps, for a nominal fee, being your life coach going forward. What do you think, Dan?", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "You mean Allen isn't going to take that over?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Dan, now we know there's going to be a second change. No more Mexican food and no kicking Jenkins around.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And I know you're going to miss that, Dan. But what can we do for you today, Dan?", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "First just a clarification. You gave your expectation for 2016 on the energy sales. And I'm not sure I got for the large industrial ex mines. It was 1-point-what?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "1.2%, Dan.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "And so, related to that, I was kind of curious where you see that coming from, given how 2015 performed, that seems like kind of a pickup. But I wondered if you could give us more color on that. And somewhat related to that, I was wondering if you are seeing any impact in the sand customers related to what's going on with the energy.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "A very good question, Dan. And let me try to cover the waterfront for you. Pat and Scott should add any color they would like to add. But first of all, let me tackle the frac sand. In essence, given the frac sand operations, and there are about 110 of them in the western part of the State of Wisconsin. We really don't serve electricity to any of the major ones in the western part of the state. It's really \u2013 that's really natural gas demand for us. And because we've just completed in November the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in Wisconsin gas history, we haven't up till now served a significant amount of the frac sand demand for natural gas.", "So while the frac sand industry has declined along with the big drop in oil prices, we still have an opportunity to grow over the longer term and the medium term in terms of our natural gas distribution service to that industry in the western part of the state. So long story short, because we haven't had a lot of the service in place or a lot of the capability in place up until now, we've not really been hurt to any significant degree by the decline in the frac sand business in light of the oil crash, if I'm making any sense.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Sure. Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Then in terms of industrial demand for electricity and how are we seeing a percent-or-so growth, a couple of thoughts and then we'll ask Scott Lauber, our Treasurer, who tracks our electricity demand. I track it every day, he tracks it every hour. Long story short, we serve 17 different sectors of the industrial economy in the State of Wisconsin, and many of those sectors are either flat or slightly down when you look at 2015 performance.", "But there are four sectors where we have significant concentration in Wisconsin that actually have shown a little growth and we think may continue to show some growth in our projections in 2016. So that's food processing, paper production, printing, and plastics. So those are fairly large industrial sectors. Among the 17, those four are pretty large. And we've actually seen some uptick throughout 2015 in those four sectors. And that, in part, underlies the percent-or-so growth that we're projecting for 2016. Scott?", "Scott J. Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer", "In addition, we have some attractive rates to bring in new customers into the area. So we are actually seeing some customers building specifically in Southeastern Wisconsin some distribution centers, Amazon built here. So we're seeing that \u2013 and those actually are increasing our load in 2016 also.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it's a very good point. And, for example, Scott mentioned Amazon, well, they just built a 1 million square foot distribution center that's now operational. And now that they've got it operational, I believe they've announced they're adding another 250,000 square feet right immediately adjacent to the 1 million square feet that they just built.", "Uline, which is a major company that has moved to Wisconsin in the last seven or eight years, is just growing by leaps and bounds, and they're adding distribution capacity. So we're seeing, as Scott said, not only some strength in some of the traditional clusters in Wisconsin, but we're also seeing some large commercial growth that is now in place and beginning to operate.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Then the second thing I was curious about, you mentioned that your kind of two workshops in of the six workshops around the main replacement plan at Peoples Gas, I was wondering if you could give a little color on kind of what the discussion's been there in terms of the Commission concerns or Commission directives or if they've had any recommendations.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, actually, no recommendations yet. But I've been very encouraged by the entire approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has decided to take in terms of taking, as we suggested, a fresh look at the entire program. The workshops are very granular and technical in nature. So for example, at one of the workshops, folks from the federal pipeline safety administration have been invited to come in and discuss the 2011 call to action from the federal government to replace some of these aging cast iron and bare steel pipes.", "So this is \u2013 the way that workshops have gone so far, and you're right, two of the six have been completed, and the subject matter for the remaining four are public and the agendas are public. It's really almost stepping back and let's taking \u2013 take a complete reexamination for the need, the schedule and the shorter and long term cost estimates. And then importantly, and one of the workshops will be dedicated to this, cooperation and collaboration with the City of Chicago. And I can't tell you how important that is. I mean, while we are in the process of trying to replace 2,000 miles of aging underground pipes in Chicago, the City of Chicago is also trying to replace a significant number of aging water mains. So cooperation in terms of trying to get that work done in a scheduled collaborative basis is a real issue that needs \u2013 we need to continue to work on this. I think we've made real progress with the City of Chicago in terms of sharing information and planning for construction. But one of those workshops is really going to be dedicated to, okay, how can the two entities that are ripping up streets in Chicago best work together. So very technical in nature, but really going through \u2013 again, it's almost a complete new primer on the need for the program and how the program should be structured and scheduled going forward.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "So would you expect any revisions potentially to the CapEx budget related to the resolution of this process or how should we think about that?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the way I would think about it is, certainly the Illinois Commerce Commission is interested in the timetable and the cost. And originally, the commission set a deadline of 2030 to complete that program. I think we all want to talk about is that still a realistic deadline for completing the program; how much can efficiently and effectively be spent in any given year, and how much risk would be taken if you extended the program.", "But right now, while all of that is still being processed and all of that's still being discussed, and I believe the Commission will vote on a new plan in June, the best advice I could give you is to stick with the $250 million to $280 million a year investment plan. That's what we're finding right now. It's probably the sweet spot in terms of how much can be done efficiently during the construction (53:58) Chicago.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then just wanted to say, given your successful completion of Power the Future and Integrys, you've obviously made a large impact on the company and left a tough legacy for Allen to follow. So, good luck.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "To whom was that addressed?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Thank you, Dan.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Bye.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Bye-bye.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Steve. You don't need a life coach, do you?", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "I hope not. Thanks, Gale, and congrats on your retirement on time and on budget.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Congrats as well to Allen. So just a quick follow-up on the Illinois process. So could you maybe give a little color if the AG's office is kind of involved in these discussions on this kind of new plan? And then also, there is some attempt to still go back and keep looking back at what happened, just any color on where you see that process heading?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'd be happy to, Steve. First of all, the six workshops that the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled, the invitees are really all of the parties that have been involved in this entire program from day one. So it would be the Citizens Utility Board, it would be the City of Chicago, it would be the State Attorney General's Office. It would be a significant representation from the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. In fact, the workshops are being moderated by the head of the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. And all of the folks that have been invited to participate are participating.", "From what we've seen so far in the first two workshops, I would say that there are more informational type questions. I mean, for example, the State Attorney General's Office has asked, \"Well, does all the cast iron pipe that's a certain age really need to be replaced?\" So they're very technical questions. I mean, this is almost, I think, a terrific opportunity to get everybody on the same basis in terms of information and knowledge about the program. So I'm actually very encouraged by the approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has taken. I think it will be an opportunity, again, to put everybody on the same basis of information and also really have a very strong dialogue with the natural gas division of how the company and the City of Chicago need to cooperate in the streets.", "So that's really kind of the color I would give you so far. Again, very encouraged by the participation, by the kind of questions, and by the understanding that's building that with this kind of aging infrastructure, this is something that should not, cannot be ignored. So that would be my thoughts on the workshops.", "And again, we've filed a three-year plan that put our top priorities in place for the neighborhoods that we thought were most at risk, and we'll see what the Commission decides. But their plan would be to vote on the longer-term future for the advanced main replacement program by June. And again, I would say to you, given everything we've seen around the country, both from a natural gas and water standpoint, it's just not \u2013 I don't think anyone thinks it's wise to ignore the urgent need to upgrade that system in Chicago.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And then going backward, the Attorney General's Office is asking, as they have, about an $8 billion cost estimate for the long-term investment need of the program, and that need or that cost estimate surfaced, as you know, immediately after we acquired the company. And so the Attorney General's Office is wondering, who knew in the prior company, the prior management, about the $8 billion estimate and why was the $8 billion estimate, which was a preliminary estimate, why was that not disclosed prior to the closing of the acquisition? So that docket, if you will, is still open before the Illinois Commerce Commission.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Good luck.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Paul. How are you today?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "All right. Congratulations to both you..", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Thank you.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "...and Allen. One quick one for you here. The sales growth projection, does that include leap year or is that taken out?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That actually, includes leap year. Yep. It's worth about 0.3% (59:19).", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Right. So that would indicate that you guys really are not expecting much in the way of any growth.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That is correct.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "Yep.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Has there been a change in how you've begun to forecast things since it's been, generally speaking, lower than what you guys had \u2013 over the years, you guys have been a little bit more optimistic about sales growth than what's actually happened. Have you reappraised that, or are you guys just getting more \u2013 or is there something else that's driving you to wind down the sales growth?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think certainly given the experience of 2015 and 2014, and obviously we were projecting at least 0.5% growth in electric demand or electric consumption on the retail side in those prior years, we brought it down a little. There's no question about that.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "What do you think is going on?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think there may be a couple of things here. And we ask ourselves \u2013 we have all kinds of meetings saying, what the hell is going on? But first of all, many companies in our industry were projecting far stronger growth than we have projected, and they haven't seen it develop either. My own view, and this is strictly a personal view and anecdotal, but just based on years of experience, I think there are three things going on.", "2014 and 2015 may be a bit of an aberration from a small commercial and residential standpoint. 2014 and 2015, the weather was just mild is probably the best word, mild summers, mild winters, just no abnormally high or abnormally low temperatures, but no persistence of a weather trend. And one of the things that weather normalization techniques does not pick up is the lack of, say, 15 days of 90-degree weather. If you have two days of 90-degree weather, you can do the weather normalization. But I don't think it picks up the fact that you didn't have any persistent weather one way or another and persistent weather drives consumption and drives usage.", "So, I think one thing that has happened is we haven't seen a really good long heat wave and even though last winter was a little bit colder than normal, it was spotty. It wasn't 15 days in a row of 10 degrees. So, in my mind, the jury is still out related to longer-term growth. If we get back to a year in which we have some consistent and persistent weather patterns. That's number one.", "But number two, I don't think there's any question that we're seeing more residential conservation in the last couple of years. I don't think there's any question about that. And when you think about why that may be, I mean, it really comes down to technology. You've heard me say before that if you replace a big screen television that you may be bought seven or eight years ago with a brand new one, you're probably going to use 60% to 80% less electricity. Your iPad requires less energy to charge than your computer screen standalone. You buy a new washer and dryer. They're far more energy efficient, same thing with refrigerators. You have the Nest thermostats. There's just a lot more technology available to customers. So essentially, what we're kind of seeing here is our customer growth, which continues to be good, being offset by conservation.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. There have been some articles about these coal dust complaints by neighbors in around Oak Creek. Can you comment on that in terms of how should we think about that?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Well, first of all, let me just reiterate that we have air monitors that continually give us data on emissions from the Oak Creek plant, and we are well within compliance with all the air standards, number one. Number two, there are a number of homes in the general vicinity of the Oak Creek plant where individuals have indicated they are having health problems, and they believe it's because of the infiltration of coal dust in their homes.", "So, what we've agreed to do and what we're in the process right now is we have agreed with those homeowners on a testing protocol, and we are having a firm (1:03:55) go into each one of these homes and through samples collected them from various places in the homes of these individuals. And then we're having a lab analyze the dust samples and indicate to all of the homeowners \u2013 we're sending them over, explaining what is in their dust samples.", "Right now, the scene would indicate that there are health problems, at least from our expert standpoint, nothing that would indicate that there are health problems from any prevalence of dust.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then back to the deleveraging potential, what would be the security or what would be the interest rate that you guys might be thinking about retiring? In other words, if you were to pay down debt at the parent, what are we thinking about in terms of the cost of that debt?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the average cost of the debt was 2.21%.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Well, let's separate, I think it's important to kind of separate out the debt. There's the acquisition debt, which is the 2.21% as Gale just pointed out, and then there's all the other debt at the holding company.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Example of which is the hybrid security that flips the floating at the end of this year. That's I believe paying 6.11% right now. And there's also some longer-term debt instruments at the holding company. Think of the hybrids and those longer-term bonds is what we're targeting for takeout, not the 2.21% debt.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. So the 6.11% would be the sort of pre-tax benefit you guys would see from buying it back, is that right? What you're thinking \u2013 I mean, obviously, (1:05:43) acquisition team may browse. But is that kind of what we're thinking about in terms of what the cost of the securities you're thinking of retiring potentially would be?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's one good example or if it wasn't retired and again, we're assessing what the best options are here. If it wasn't retired, it flips to a very low floating interest rate, right.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Right. I mean, that's why I'm sort of wondering about it. I mean, it would seem to me, what we're seeing is a lot of leverage that's being deployed in terms of acquisitions that are being proposed and what have you recently. And I'm just wondering given the cost of debt, it doesn't usually look like that big a bang for the buck. And I just wonder if you'd elaborate a little bit more in terms of you're thinking process about that. Your credit ratings for the most part are pretty strong. So, I mean, I'm just sort of thinking about sort of why you guys are bringing this up now and sort of what might be driving that?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll give a shot at that. I think the real answer to your question is we wanted to show the range of options that we have for beneficial use of the cash that's coming from bonus depreciation. And clearly, our preferred option is to benefit customers from that cash with projects that really are useful and needed for reliability. So that's option one, two, three, four, and five.", "And, as Allen mentioned, there may be \u2013 in the latter part of that five-year period for bonus depreciation, there may be the emergence of some transmission projects or generation projects for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. So all of those things are kind of preferred options. But if none of those things or if not all of them came to pass, we also have an option to further deleverage beyond the plan.", "So, it really wasn't \u2013 we didn't mean to give you the idea that this was going to be an immediate type of a preferred priority. It is something we have in the toolbox if needed.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. But not perhaps all that likely to be used, depending on what opportunities are in the business as well?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That's how I would look at it. It is an option, and we'll iterate as we go along for the best benefit of customers and shareholders.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much and congratulations again.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thank you, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Paul. How are you?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "I'm well. Thank you. It's February in Cleveland, and the kids in the neighborhood are wearing shorts.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Man, it's amazing, isn't it?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Crazy. As you look at Manitoba Hydro and ATC, what kind of incremental capital opportunities do you see there?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "At this point, I really can't give you an estimate.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Just too early?", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "It's just too early.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's too early.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And what was the fuel, under or over recovery in the fourth quarter?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "In the fourth quarter we were fully recovered I think going into Q4.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "So it's...", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then your comment...", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "We'll follow offline...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll get the precise number for you and we'll get the precise number and we'll ask Colleen or Beth to give you a callback. But it was not a material impact on earnings in Q4.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then can you review your comments on Trillium and what the gain is and when you'll realize that?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll ask Allen to comment but we expect pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $130 million. But again, that sale falls within the window of purchase price accounting adjustments. So, in terms of the report of ongoing earnings that we would provide to you next quarter, it won't have any impact on plus or minus on earnings. Allen?", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you very much. Oh, go ahead...", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. Allen was saying, yeah.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Congratulations, Allen, and happy trails (1:09:53), Gale.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you so much. Take care.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. Please go ahead.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "My favorite, Andy Levi. How are you, Andy?", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Hey. I'm doing well. I just want to say thanks, Gale. You've done a great job.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you, Andy. I appreciate your support.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "I appreciate your friendship over the years. And Allen, I remember meeting you when you were an IR person back at Southern. I remember saying to Paul Patterson that you'd make a great CEO one day. So, there you go.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I bet. Were you one of the first (01:10:31)?", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Seriously, Allen. You will do a great job. I know you will and...", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "I appreciate it, Andy.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "...I congratulate you. And actually all my questions were asked and answered. So, I'm good. I'm great.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Andy, thank you so much. We'll see you soon.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hi guys.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "The last guy is up. A double dip today.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Yeah. A follow-up question. Quick new bucket, since there's been so many moving pieces here, what you expect maybe broadly speaking, the earnings contributions from WPS, We, Power The Future and Peoples, just the big buckets, for 2016, just so our models are all calibrated correctly?", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. I'm going to look toward Pat and Scott. I've got a general idea, but they've got more specific bucket delineation than I have right in front of me.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Can I do it by segment, Jim? That might be easier on the call.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Why don't we take it by segment and like by state.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So by segment or by state, if you look at Wisconsin, maybe 16%; 11% Illinois; 2% from our MERC and MGU, so our Michigan and Minnesota Gas Utilities; maybe 10% from ATC. What does that give me, Power the Future? And Power the Future is...", "Scott J. Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer", "20%.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Do the math in whatever I missed, 20%?", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "71%, 81%, 83%, so 17%.", "Allen L. Leverett - President & Director", "17%, somewhere in that zip code. That Scott's trustee calculator back of the envelope. We can get you something a little more crisp, but that's directionally correct.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "So then where's the 5% to 7% earnings growth coming from?", "Scott J. Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer", "All of those entities. It's actually 6% to 8%.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "6% to 8% next year, then we can kind of step through that as \u2013 when we have the new investor materials, we could probably walk through where each segment is moving relative and how that could contributes to the 6% to 8%.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.", "James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer", "Again, we will see earnings growth from every one of those segments.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That is correct.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jim.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think that concludes our conference call for today. And if you have any further questions, the famous Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office, 414-221-2592. Thanks again, everybody.

(NYSE:WEC) Q1 2016 Earnings Call May  3, 2016  2:00 PM ET", "Executives", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Operator", "Good afternoon, and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for First Quarter 2016 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Charlene. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year. But before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. I'm pleased to welcome Scott Lauber as our new Chief Financial Officer. Many of you know Scott from his previous role as our Treasurer, but before that he had a number of other roles in our accounting and finance organization.", "Now Scott is taking over from Pat Keyes. Pat is now responsible for our operations in Michigan and Minnesota, as well as supply chain, information technology and strategy for WEC Energy Group as a whole. I also welcome Jim Schubilske as our new Treasurer. Like Scott, Jim has held numerous positions in our accounting and finance organization and he was most recently responsible for our State Regulatory area. Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President, leads our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Groups are also here with me.", "So with that, let me now turn to our first quarter 2016 results. WEC Energy Group was formed in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Integrys in June of last year. Until now, we have focused our discussion on Legacy Wisconsin Energy standalone results. Starting today, our focus shifts to the entire company's results.", "We reported first quarter earnings of $1.09 a share that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share in the first quarter of 2015. Scott will be reviewing the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.", "Now taking a look at the state of the economy for our largest segment, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, which is well below the national average. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68.7%, which is more than 5 points above the national rate. Also worthy of note, Wisconsin led the nation in adding manufacturing jobs in March. Electricity used by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. Our electric utility's large customers, excluding the iron ore mines consumed approximately 0.8% less electricity in the first quarter compared to 2015. However, we continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy including plastics, food processing and paper production.", "In addition, we are continuing to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our Wisconsin utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers, and nearly 11,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota added nearly 16,000 customers in the past year. This increase includes the acquisition of approximately 10,000 natural gas customers in Minnesota from Alliant Energy in April of 2015.", "We are achieving the results we expected from the Integrys acquisition. Our focus on cost controls and the tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. Subject to Public Service Commission of Wisconsin action, which is not expected, we will not file 2017 test year base rate cases this year for our Wisconsin utilities.", "As we have discussed on previous calls, our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% of a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Here of course to delivering this growth is executing our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation.", "I want to give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. Last December, Congress passed a tax bill that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits from the bonus depreciation extension, about two-thirds of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although, we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings in 2016, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 and following years. We have advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million, which includes the $100 million that we previously identified in the February call.", "As a result, we now forecast our 2016 and 2017 capital budgets at $1.55 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current five-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our five-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Financial Conference.", "Turning now to our operations in Illinois, we're moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program or AMRP at Peoples Gas, one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas infrastructure.", "Over the past nine months, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 18% complete. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission or ICC late last year that describes our top priorities for the next three years. The plan's key components include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast-iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, projected investment of $250 million to $280 million a year, and regular updates to the ICC and other stakeholders to keep them informed of our progress. While the engineering, fieldwork, and cost recovery of AMRP continued, the ICC held six workshops to assess our plan. These recently concluded workshops brought together key stakeholders to review the planned scope, schedule and long-term cost with a focus on safety and reliability. We expect that the ICC staff will issue its report late in May and that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the year. However, in the interim, the AMRP work will continue.", "Next, a brief reminder on our dividend. On January 21, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is now at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.", "Before I ask Scott to review the details of our first quarter earnings, I want to cover one last item. I met with quite a number of investors and analysts, and including many of you over the last few months after our management transition was announced. Quite often I've been asked, Allen what will be different when you are a CEO. Now it's really easier for me to tell all of you what will be the same. Our company will continue to focus on the fundamentals, safety, customer satisfaction, reliability and financial discipline. I believe this focus has served us well since I joined the company in 2003, and will continue to do so.", "So, now for more details on our first quarter results, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 a share from $0.90 in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.09 a share in the first quarter of 2016. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.", "First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $589.3 million as compared to an adjusted $367.6 million in 2015, an increase of $221.7 million.", "Starting with Wisconsin, operating income in the first quarter totaled $327.5 million for 2016, an increase of $50 million from the adjusted first quarter of 2015. On the favorable side, we realized $76.9 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service. This was offset by lower operating income from Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas related to the mild winter temperatures. We estimate that electric and gas margins of these two utilities decreased by $29 million because of the warmer weather.", "In the first quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment added $137 million of operating income and our other state segment added $31.8 million of operating income. We did not have operations in these segments until our acquisition of Integrys.", "Operating income in the We Power segment was up $800,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investments at our Power the Future plants. Our Corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $300,000 this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2015.", "Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at the $221.7 million increase in operating income on an adjusted basis.", "During the first quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.5 million, an increase of $22.4 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase on our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the acquisition of Integrys.", "Our other net increased $29.7 million, largely due to repurchase of $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% Junior Subordinated Notes at a discount in February 2016, as well as higher AFUDC due to the inclusion of the AFUDC from the Integrys companies.", "Our net interest expense increased $41.5 million, driven by $34.8 million of interest expense from Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition.", "Earnings from the Integrys company drove an increase in our consolidated income tax expense of $90.2 million. There were no significant changes in our effective income tax rate. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings us to $346.2 million of net income for the first quarter of 2016 or earnings of $1.09 per share.", "Net cash provided by operating activities increased $365.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by $307.8 million of net cash flow from operating activities of Integrys during the first quarter of 2016. The remaining difference was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans partially offset by changes in working capital.", "You may recall that we contributed a $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. Our capital expenditures totaled $312 million in the first quarter, a $158.8 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to the Integrys companies.", "Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 50.4% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "We also paid $156.2 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $60.9 billion over the first quarter last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition, and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first quarter in 2015.", "For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the first quarter. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and factoring out the effect of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were down slightly by 0.2% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.", "Now looking at the individual customer segments. Weather-normalized residential deliveries dropped 0.3% while actual residential deliveries fell 4.2%. Across our small and commercial industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 1.5%, actual deliveries decreased 0.2%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2016 decreased 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries decreased 0.8%.", "Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 1% compared to the same period in 2015. Actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas for power generation, were down 10.7% compared to gas sales in last year's first quarter due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter were slightly below our expectations.", "Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share, which represents 6% to 8% growth. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related cost. We are off to a strong start, but still have nine months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share.", "Finally, let's look at the outlook for quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year. If we take a step back, we see new a quarterly pattern to earnings per share. The Integrys acquisition brings a larger gas component to the combined company. This means we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarter due to gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years.", "This brings us to our second quarter earnings per share guidance. Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and April being a little cooler than last year, we expect our second quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related cost. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.51 to $0.55 per share.", "With that, I will turn things back to Allen.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Scott. I think, overall, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hello, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Hey, guys. Congratulations, Allen.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "So thanks for the update on the CapEx. I'm looking at slide 14 from your April business update.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "And so you've taken your CapEx for 2016 to $1.55 billion versus $1.499 billion and you've taken your 2017 CapEx to $1.9 billion from $1.553 billion. Can you just review again what capital projects you've brought forward and if we should assume that that capital comes out of the 2018 to 2020 budget? Or are you also reevaluating customer beneficial projects that you could put in, move forward such that those would stay relatively level?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Greg, so, if I could, let me answer your second question, and then Scott, I'm going to ask you maybe to give Greg a little bit of color about the types of projects that we're advancing. So, Greg, on your second question, you should not assume that the increases that we're making in the 2016 and 2017 spending would result in a corresponding decrease in the later years, because we're also revaluating those later years. So, Scott, if you could, maybe just give Greg a little more background about some of the things that we're advancing.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Just to give you a few examples, over these last couple of months, we looked across the enterprise. And for example, we are looking and we are going to implement a neat \u2013 updating our ERP system, the general ledger, consolidations, so that part of the general ledger and that could be up to $100 million. Another example is, we looked at Wisconsin, the gas and electric distribution system, and we're increasing that about $150 million on value-added customer projects. And then, another area when we look at, in Illinois, we have a large gas storage facility, underground storage in Illinois, and we're going to spend about $35 million over the next couple of years, looking at safety reliability within that storage field. So, basically across the enterprise found some good projects to bring up and move forward into this period.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Great. And because of the impact of bonus depreciation, that doesn't really have a net \u2013 it's a net-neutral impact on what the customer would otherwise see in terms of bill impacts, correct?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "The capital costs?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Fantastic. And can you give us what a comparable pro forma theoretical quarterly earnings number would have been last year in the second quarter had you owned Integrys, so we could compare the $0.51 to $0.55 to that?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We looked at this at a very, very high level trying to take out all the acquisition adjustments and adjusting really just for the shares outstanding. It was about $0.53 \u2013 $0.52, $0.53.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. So it's going to be a little bit difficult for us as we roll through the year to get our minds around the new base of earnings. But would it be fair to say that as you stand today, if you were to assume normal weather and you were spot on your load growth forecast for the year that you are at the high end, low end, above, below your current guidance range for the year?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say at this point, I mean, if you take it sort of \u2013 if you look at what happened with the hybrids in the first quarter, that was in our annual plan. It was just uncertain as to when in the year it would occur. So that certainly would not represent a pickup versus the financial plan.", "I think another significant driver, Scott, was related to fuel recoveries in Wisconsin where we had positive fuel recoveries in the first quarter. But our assumption for the year, Greg, would be that we would just be fully recovered. So I think given those two things, I would say that we're sort of more at the middle of our range. And as I look at it, we're sort of neutral against our financial plan. If you adjust for the items in the first quarter that I either expect would reverse in the case of the fuel recoveries or I had already included in the annual plan, it was just an uncertainty about the timing.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC", "Fantastic. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, Allen. Congrats again. So just on the rate case delay, can you give us a sense of whether kind of staff is supportive of that, if other parties have had a view, and when will we know when the commission is kind of okay with it?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it in terms of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin staff, they're okay with it, and they've indicated that to us in writing that they're in agreement with it. So, at this point, Steve, the commission itself, they don't have to take any action at all for there not to be a rate case. So, my expectation at this point, as I was saying in the prepared remarks, my expectation would be, we wouldn't file a case for base rates in 2017 \u2013 for 2017. However, I would expect, Steve, that in August, we would do a fuel filing for 2017 rates, and say more likely than not we might see a slight reduction in the fuel rate, but we'll have to look at our numbers when we file in August.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. I thought you said in your prepared remarks not file 2017 subject to PSC approval.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No. I didn't say subject to approval. I said subject to any PSC action. And so, just to be clear, they don't have to take any affirmative action here. So, if they do nothing, which would be my expectation, they wouldn't take an action, we wouldn't have a rate case.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And I assume what you are doing is utilizing merger synergies to help mitigate what would have been the rate needs.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. So, when we went through the process with the merger approval, we talked about the ability to get what we felt would be reasonably significant cost savings and we're seeing those materialize. And so that allows us to freeze base rates, which we think is a benefit to customers.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jonathan.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good afternoon, guys. Could I just ask you to give us a little bit of a bridge between the $130-odd-million that Integrys booked in the first quarter of last year and the $160-odd-million that you have this quarter? Just what were the moving pieces?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, Scott, I think I'll let you, maybe based on the earnings package just give Jonathan a little bit of background. But I will say this, Jonathan, if you look across the Integrys companies, I think we really have these companies on track to all earn their allowed rates of return. So that's part of the difference that you saw as compared to the first quarter of 2015.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Scott, do you want to fill in a little bit on that?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, also when we look at it, we had a full-year rate case at PGL. So, at our Illinois utility, there was a rate case that was effective I think in February of last year. So, we had a full rate earnings in there. We also had a rate case at Wisconsin Public Service, so that was also an increase. And remember, there's two pieces to the Wisconsin Public Service there was an overall it looked flat, but one of that was a fuel, but there was a base rate increase, so that came through. Once again, Allen talked about the fuel \u2013 the positive recovery in fuel and some of that was in the Wisconsin Public Service area too compared to prior year. We also had rate cases that were implemented at our smaller gas utilities in Michigan and Minnesota, both of those had rate increases this last year. So, basically getting the rate increases in, getting the cost control in, and getting on a path to get to the full return at all the utilities.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great, thank you. And then just on \u2013 I think that when you gave the second quarter guidance, I think I heard you right, you said that April had been a little cooler than normal in the context of the new gas year business mix. So is that a help or a hurt versus normal?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's a great question. April is a transition month and so, in April, we're not really getting a lot of gas sales. It does help the gas a little bit. But on the electric side, April is a month when you get that commercial industrial buildings that actually uses some air conditioning. So, having a mile month here, we really don't \u2013 we see that little more of a down on our earnings more from the electric side not picking in yet than the gas side picking up the offset.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I mean, you called it out, but I'm guessing it's not that significant given it's April.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. No, it's $2 million to $3 million, maybe.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jon.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. Hey, Allen. Couple of things. First of all, on a cents-per-share basis, the increase in other income related to the early pay-down at a discount of some of the Integrys debt, that's worth, what, roughly $0.05 to $0.06 in EPS?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me maybe talk about it in two pieces, Michael. Of course, we bought the securities I think at approximately 83% of par, so that resulted in a $0.04 per share impact in the first quarter. And they were repurchased, say, mid February, so there was a tiny bit of interest savings, Michael, in the first quarter, but very little, probably less than a tenth of a cent, but if you look forward to the rest of the year, we would expect to see another $0.01 per share benefit because of the \u2013 of the reduction in interest expense. So about $0.04 in the first quarter from the being below par, and then $0.01 in the remainder of the year for interest. And Scott, anything to add to that?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, that's it. That's right on.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And can you talk about if you were to look at just the Integrys O&M in first quarter of 2015, and WEC \u2013 Legacy WEC O&M in that same period, and then combined, what was the O&M decline rate or O&M savings that you've realized so far year-to-date in 2016? And what do you \u2013 what's embedded in guidance?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, as we look at that in the O&M, and remember when you look at the O&M line, there's a lot more than just the O&M that's in the \u2013 what I would say, into the operations, there is O&M as it relates to regulatory amortizations, O&M that's related to the different riders. So, overall when we look at the O&M, we did have the savings that we had forecasted in with our \u2013 with the acquisition. When you look at \u2013 break back the different pieces, I would say on Wisconsin Electric, the O&M was up just a tad as it relates to a couple of storms we had in the area, and we accelerate a little bit of our forestry program because of the mild temperatures. We haven't specifically said what our O&M guidance is in the acquisition savings but overall when you look at it, it's probably O&M when you factored all the different stuff about 2% to 3% less than if you look at the combined adding up the simple O&M from the prior companies...", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And do you think you are in the early innings of realizing O&M savings or do you think you're at a pretty good run rate, meaning, do you still think, you have significant opportunity to takeout significantly more cost around the consolidated system from here?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I guess, you used the baseball analogy. So, I'd say we are probably in the third inning, and I think there is a fair amount of additional work that we can do.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you Allen, much appreciate it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Hi. How you doing?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm good. How are you?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "All right. Just on the rate freeze letter that came out last week, what \u2013 how was that triggered? I mean, was that just basically \u2013 was this related to the merger or what sort of triggered the \u2013 I guess, it seemed like maybe the staff, it wasn't clear to me the letter, what actually was causing the review by the staff?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, typically the cycle in Wisconsin every two years, of course you do a case for the next \u2013 for the next year, and then known and significant (33:24) for the year after that. So this was our year typically to bring the companies in, and we've had \u2013 we had discussions with the staff. And we said look, we believe because of the benefits we're seeing from the merger that we're just going to freeze rates. And if we have increased cost in other areas, we're going to offset that with the benefits of the merge and we're just going to freeze base rates. So the \u2013 basically the avenue for the discussions was this very regular cycle to file rate cases. And so, we work through that avenue and talk with the staff and it's something that they were agreeable. And it's kind of interesting, Paul, as a part of when we're doing the merger proceedings, many people talked about as a proposal doing a rate freeze. So, now we're actually seeing the base rate freeze for 2017 in Wisconsin.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. And then there was, as I recall, some sort of accounting treatment that was part of it. Could you elaborate a little bit more this?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, and let me sort of start and then I'll let Scott or Jim fill in any detail. So I think what you're referring to Paul is, at Wisconsin Public Service related to the ReACT project, and when Wisconsin Public Service went through their last rate case, so this was the rate case that was decided late last \u2013 late 2015 or 2016 rates. So they included in rates I believe at a $275 million level, the cost of the ReACT project. And so, we expect that the final cost of that project will be in a range of $335 million to $345 million. So, essentially what they would allow us to do with this accounting order is to differ in effect the impacts of the return off and on for that additional investment above $275 million. So, Scott..", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. That's correct. There's \u2013 I think as a total, there is three of them. The ReACT is the main one. The other two were some deferrals that specifically in the order they ended in December of 2016 and we said well, if we're going to be out for a year we just need the same accounting treatment in 2016 and in 2017, just to extend them into 2017.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay, great. And then, just finally \u2013 I'm sorry you were talking kind of quickly on the weather-adjusted sales. Did that include leap year? That wasn't clear to me. Or I mean, was it adjusted for leap year or...?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah...", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Was leap year sort of left in there?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. We factored out leap year.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So we adjusted as if \u2013 we adjusted it down as if leap year did not happen.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So February 29 was out.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's factored out. Correct.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And that was minus 0.2% for retail sales in general, right?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "How are you?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Good. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the first questions on the CapEx, perhaps just to kick it off. Can you elaborate a little bit on the next leg of the evaluation you kind of described by the EEI timeframe this fall you'll have the next round. What are the next layers of evaluation that you're looking at? Is there any kind of sense as to what genre of projects or at least magnitude of capital you could potentially be looking at in maybe these baseball analogies? How deep in terms of innings are you in terms of finding those acceleration opportunities?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. Well, you know as I mentioned earlier, about two-thirds of the impact is the bonus depreciation. So about two-thirds of the $1 billion is in 2016 and 2017. So, other than the second order effects associated with getting bonus depreciation on this additional property, I guess, we've identified $500 million of roughly $670 million. So I guess that's pretty late innings in terms of identifying offsets in 2016 and 2017. So I would say that Julien that the majority of our focus as we work through the rest of the year, up to when we have the November Finance Conference, the majority of our focus is going to be in the later years. And, Scott, I don't know if there is any other detail.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. So, exactly the majority will be in the later years. We also are working on making sure we have all the resources and efficiently for 2017 spending, get everything lined up to put due to spending in. So, we will be working on those later years this summer.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And I think one thing Julien that maybe to give you a sense for how broadly we are looking, let's just take, for example, and this is not included in any of 2016 or 2017 numbers that we talked about, but one of the things we talked about a lot, although in Illinois and in Michigan, our gas utilities there actually own some gas storage, in Wisconsin, our gas utilities to my knowledge have never owned gas storage. They've always leased it. And, we think that it would make more sense to have a mix of owned storage as well as the leased storage. So I think that would be a nice opportunity \u2013 investment opportunity for the company. But we think it would also be beneficial for customers. So, we're trying to think broadly about what those capital opportunities might be, Julien. I hope that helps.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Absolutely. And does that also add into the decision to push out the rate case timing, recovery of the accelerated spend in 2016 and 2017 with the slightly delayed rate case. Is that kind of aligned with the thinking as well?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it certainly contributes, but I think far and away the reason why we can freeze rates is because of the cost savings that we're seeing from the combination of the companies. But, you're right, I mean the accelerated depreciation impact acts as a bit of an uplift if you will also.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Right. Great. And actually just turning back to what you just alluded to there, how much in terms of lease expense or just if you can give us a sense of how much of that PPA needs potentially acquired via any Wisconsin Gas storage opportunities? I know it's early days there, but I figured I'd ask.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Julien, in all candor, it's just a little early for me to throw those numbers out.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "No worries at all. We can leave it there.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. As we know more, I mean, that's certainly something we can chat about either on the call or a future call or at EEI.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Jim.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hey, Allen. How are you?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I am good. How about you?", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Pretty good. Switching topics, could we just talk about the transmission opportunities out there, specifically as it relates to Alaska? Are there any updates that we need to be aware of?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, Jim. There really aren't any updates at this point beyond what we talked about on our call, I guess, back in February. So nothing new there in terms of updates. Scott, anything you have to add on that?", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not aware of anything.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No. Nothing.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "I guess, the question is, is transmission opportunities in the state of Alaska a function of the price of oil and the Alaska fiscal health?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in terms of the briefing that I received from Mike Rowe who is the CEO out at ATC, what he has told me is, basically if you look at the local economy, integrating the operations of the utilities is a benefit regardless of what the price of oil is, regardless of how low or how high. There is a benefit of integrating those utilities because they're certainly not integrated at all at the level that you would see in the continental United States. So there are big benefits with that regardless of the price of oil. And sort of, I guess, ironically, the low oil prices actually mean that the companies in Alaska might actually look a little more to ATC to provide the capital for the transmission projects. So I would say, worst case, the oil prices are sort of a neutral and although it sounds a little strange, the lower prices might actually mean that marginally ATC might be called on to make a bit more of the investment that's required.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Okay. I appreciate the help. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jim.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Vedula.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Hey, Allen. How are you? Congratulations, and nice to hear from you.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. No, I haven't talked to you in a long time. Glad you're doing well.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Anyways, you touched on these things kind of around the edges, but when you came in 2003 and your mission was fairly clear. You had Power the Future that had been improved, but it simply was a matter of execution and getting that done and the non-regulated businesses that you had to cleanup. So the focus was fairly clear and that gave you \u2013 that was basically a runway of about eight years from, say, 2003 until 2010, 2011, whatever. So I'm wondering today \u2013 it's like we're sitting here in 2016. You have the merger done and you have the big pipeline replacement program in Illinois and everything like that. I'm wondering just if you can kind of give a sense of how much runway you think you have here. And just, even if it's not necessarily as large or as dramatic as what was sitting in front of you in 2003, can you just put it in context the way you're thinking about it going forward over the next few years?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right. Well, I think as you look at -- of course, Power the Future, I guess, you could think of it, if you just looked at the new generation that was being built. I mean, that was sort of, as it turned out, a roughly seven to eight-year program. So, as you say, that's in the past. As we look at sort of what's coming up, we've got some programs like the AMRP program in Illinois, which we're probably looking at decades long. I mean, you're looking at programs that are ongoing for 20 to 25 years at least.", "So we've got some programs that we think will be around a lot longer, even longer than Power the Future. We've got others that were kind of shorter in nature, and we talk some about the ERP project in Wisconsin. But I would say overall, Vedula, I mean, I think we easily have a runway of 10 or more years of capital investment that we think will benefit customers, in the case of Chicago, like a huge upgrade in safety. So I would say it's at least 10 years. But now it's really multiple programs in multiple states as opposed to being a single program and one and only in one state. I hope that helps.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Yeah. No, just to clear also I think you've also touched on this in terms of you talked a lot about load growth and just conservation, efficiencies, and everything like that. When you look back to 2003 or whatever, I mean, we were still seeing fairly strong growth in terms of usage and everything like that. Going forward, that's not necessarily going to be the case. But I'm just \u2013 in terms of supporting kind of the ability to continue to grow whatever in terms of your earnings or whatever, I'm just wondering whether the things you referenced should be enough, even without any real net load growth. And also the one other thing I wanted to ask you is, in the past, you used to talk about having a couple hundred million dollars of free cash flow, net of CapEx and dividends. Can you just kind of refresh us in terms of where that kind of stands going forward as well?", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And maybe, Scott, why don't you cover the cash flow question? But I would say, Vedula, I mean, clearly the situation with volume growth, be it electric or natural gas, it's going to be a bit of a headwind, which is why I think having the merger is beneficial to us, because we can generate some more cost savings to help deal with those headwinds. But Scott, why don't you give Vedula some background on the cash.", "Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. In looking at our cash and remember we said in our prepared remarks and just lately, we said in our prepared remarks, we are not issuing any equity. Part of the acquisition reasons were to invest in good utility projects. So we are investing in utility projects that are very needed for the infrastructure. When you look at 2016 and 2017, we are not cash flow positive, but we also look at our consolidated debt to capital ratio and our consolidated holding company debt. And the holding company debt as a percent of total debt is about 28%, consistent with our projections, and we see that continuing to be there. So we are not cash flow positive, but we are not issuing any equity, and that's for the 2016 and 2017 timeframe, and we'll look at our projections as we go forward as we look at our capital plans in the future.", "Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Vedula.", "Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Well, that concludes our conference call today.

Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Charlene. Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, who is our Controller; and finally Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.", "Now let's look at our second quarter 2016 results, the end of the second quarter marked the first anniversary of our Integrys acquisition, which closed on June 29 last year. Consistent with the first quarter, we are now reporting results of the combined company. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings, in both 2015 and 2016, include interest on the debt issued to purchase Integrys as well as the shares we issued in the transaction.", "Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. The results of our integration efforts have exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, our focus on cost controls and other tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. We submitted our standard annual electric fuel filings in Wisconsin on July 1, asking for a modest reduction at We Energies and a slight increase at Wisconsin Public Service. The only active rate case is that our Minnesota gas utility where interim rates are in place.", "Our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key to delivering this growth is the execution of our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. Now, let me give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. We believe that approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits will be generated from the bonus depreciation extension, about two thirds of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings this year, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017, as well as in following years.", "As you may recall from the first quarter call, we've advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million. In addition, we've made progress in the later years of our five-year forecast. We now expect to extend our electric System Modernization and Reliability Project at Wisconsin Public Service. This should represent another $100 million of capital investment in the 2019 and 2020 period. I would add that this is a popular program with customers at Wisconsin Public Service who are seeing significant benefits in the form of greatly reduced outages during storms. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current five-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our five-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Finance conference.", "Turning now to our operations in Illinois, we're moving forward on the Peoples' gas system modernization program formerly known as AMRP. This is one of the largest natural gas system infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipelines. Over the past year, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 19% complete, and we continue to make good progress. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission late last year that describes our top priorities in the three-year period from 2016 to 2018. The plan calls for removing and replacing more than 250 miles of aging cast-iron pipes in neighborhoods most at risk. This will require investing a projected $250 million to $280 million a year.", "After hearing stakeholder recommendations on issues such as the program's emphasis on safety and reliability, scope, schedule, cost forecast and controls and plans for measuring and monitoring progress, the ICC staff conducted a policy session in April summarizing the six workshops and then provided a comprehensive report to the commission on May 31. Last week, the ICC issued an order to begin a proceeding to evaluate the matters covered in the ICC staff report. The first step in the proceeding is expected to be completed within 30 days when we are required to provide the ICC with an updated plan for the gas system modernization program. We believe that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, our work on the gas infrastructure replacement program will continue.", "Now, I would like to briefly update you on two matters pending at the FERC. First at the end of June, an administrative law judge issued its recommended ROEs for the second pending complaint. The recommendation was for 9.7% base ROE and ATC could add a 50-basis-point adder for a total of 10.2% ROE. We have updated our reserve to reflect this.", "The second item pending at FERC is related to the system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant. In this case, another administrative law judge issued a recommendation requiring an approximate $20 million reduction to the payments we received for the period of February 2014 through January 2015. We are currently evaluating the ALJ's recommendation. However, if the FERC adopts the ALJ decision, I do not expect that this will result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in income. A decision is not likely until next year.", "Next, I want to give you a brief reminder on our dividend. On January 21, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.395 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is approximately at the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.", "So, now for more details on our second quarter results, here's Scott.", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share, compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01 from $0.58 in the second quarter 2015 to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the second quarter last year.", "For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 second quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculations of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 now include all interest related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliations. First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense, and income taxes.", "Referring to page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $332.1, million as compared to an adjusted $230.8 million in 2015, an increase of $101.3 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $214.7 million for 2016, an increase of $74.3 million from the adjusted second quarter of 2015. We realized a $51.5 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service and reported a $22.8 million increase driven in part by higher quarter-over-quarter electricity demand at Wisconsin Electric as temperatures in the early summer of 2016 were warmer than normal.", "In the second quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $22.6 million of operating income and our other states segment added $2.3 million of operating income. We added these segments as part of our Integrys acquisition. Operating income in the We Power segment was up $900,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized an operating loss of $1.6 million this quarter, as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower labor costs. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at a $101.3 million increase from adjusted operating income.", "Moving to other income, during the second quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $30.9 million, an increase of $16.6 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase on our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of Integrys acquisition. As Allen mentioned earlier, this was in part offset by an incremental reserve taken to reflect the most recent administrative law judge recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews.", "Our other income net increased by $6.3 million largely related to higher AFUDC to the inclusion of AFUDC from the Integrys companies.", "Our net interest expense increased $38.3 million driven by $33.7 million of interest expense from the Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition. Earnings from the Integrys companies were a primary driver of the $38.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% to 38.5%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $133.8 million or $0.58per share for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.", "Now, looking to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $507.6 million during the first six months of 2016. This increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys during the first half of 2016. The remaining increase was driven in part by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. You may recall that we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016. This increase was partially offset by changes in working capital.", "While I am on the subject of pensions, with the current interest rate environment, the potential exists for an approximate 100-basis-point reduction in our discount rate to about 3.5%. On a enterprise-wide basis, we estimate that this would add approximately $35 million to pension expense in 2017. This also could impact the level of pension contributions that would be made next year. We currently are factoring this into our 2017 plan.", "Our capital expenditures, totaled $618.7 million during the first six months of 2017 (sic) [2016] (14:53). A $250.7 million increase, compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was driven primarily by capital investments, at the Integrys companies. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 50.1% at the end of June. Our calculation treats half the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations.", "We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $312.4 million in common dividends during the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of a $121.9 million over the same period last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2015.", "We also see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our Wisconsin utilities were serving nearly 9,000 more electric customers, and nearly 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are now serving nearly 15,000 more customers in the past year.", "For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and year-to-date results factor all the effects of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Actual second quarter deliveries increased 3%.", "Looking now at the individual customer segments, weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 2.8%, while actual residential deliveries rose 7.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7%, actual deliveries increased 2.2%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2016 increased 0.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.3%. We continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines increased 0.4%.", "Now, an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2015 due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations.", "Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. We are off to a strong start. We still have six months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share.", "Finally, let's look at the third quarter guidance. As I mentioned last quarter, natural gas distribution is now a larger portion of our business thus we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first quarter and fourth quarter due to higher \u2013 to gas heating margins, and relatively lower earnings per share in the second quarter and third quarter when compared to past years. Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and warmer than normal July weather, we expect our third quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. Again, the third quarter earnings guidance is $0.55 per share to $0.59 per share.", "With that, I'll turn things back to Allen.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And now we'd like to take your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "I apologize, I hopped on just a minute or two late. You guys, I was told, did increase your capital expenditure budget in the back half of the five-year plan. Can you go back and talk about how much of rate base growth was reduced by the impact of bonus depreciation? How much of that you had offset already prior to this update? And then how much incrementally you've found in customer-friendly projects that further mitigate that impact?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd be happy to, Greg. I think some review is good. And so the bonus depreciation extension, which was really a reach-back to 2015 as well as an extension out to, I guess, 2019, we think results in about $1 billion worth of cash tax benefits. So back on the February and the May calls we gave an update to everybody on where we stood versus offsetting that $1 billion. So as we got to the end of the May call, we had identified $500 million and those were primarily this year and next. So about $500 million between 2016 and 2017.", "And so now what we've identified is another $100 million in addition to that $500 million. So the $100 million is in the years 2019 and 2020. It's about $50 million a year, Greg. And what this relates to is really the continuation of a four-year program that they've had at Wisconsin Public Service. The first phase involved distribution automation as well as undergrounding of electric distribution. The second phase will be strictly devoted, we expect to the undergrounding of electric distribution. So about $50 million in 2019, $50 million in 2020, and we also believe out in 2021 and 2022, there is yet another $50 million a year to do in those two years.", "And this program, it's been very, very popular with customers and it was interesting, this summer, we've had quite a bit of storm activity in the Wisconsin Public Service territory, and for those that had their service, had these distribution lines undergrounded, they saw a much less in terms of outage times. So it's been a very popular program. I hope that helps, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "No, that helps tremendously. And is this a continuous review process, and as we get into the next quarter and we get to EEI that you're continuing to try to observe where you could put more capital to work that has further benefits for customers or is this the end of that review?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, it's really more of the former, Greg. So we'll keep reviewing the numbers, reviewing the programs, but what we're trying to do is take a very deliberate approach, because I think the terminology that you used earlier is important. Each of these have to be customer-friendly projects. So there has to be a reliability benefit, a cost benefit, a safety benefit, or environmental performance. It's really got to be something that's beneficial to our business and beneficial to our customers. So often that takes a little time to identify those kinds of projects.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Great. To what extent could changes in the potential mix of your generation fleet, as you look to de-carbonize, have an impact on that plan towards the backend, or would that potentially roll into the next decade, so that as you look at your coal fleet, and you start to think about how you are going to balance your carbon emissions.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. And I think certainly with Clean Power Plan, and this is, I'm speculating. I don't know exactly when the first year of compliance would be with Clean Power Plan, but it's likely not to be until 2024 or after. So I would not expect, Greg. Certainly if you look into the capital forecast going out to 2020, which is what we have on the table today, I don't really see any benefit at all, at least in this forecast period, meaning from this year to 2020, from the impacts of Clean Power Plan. But hypothetically if you had a 2024 compliance date, ultimately with Clean Power Plan, perhaps you could see some impacts out in that 2021, 2022, 2023 time period.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Two more quick questions. $0.55 to $0.59 assumes normal weather you said for the balance of the quarter, so I would presume it factors in what's happened to-date in terms of demand.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. And Scott, you may want to talk a little bit about July and what we've seen in July in terms of weather.", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Yes. So it does include the month of July weather. Now, what we saw in July was it started out actually cooler than normal the first couple days and it didn't catch up to about normal degree day until about the July 17. So we really just had some warm weather the last week, week-and-a-half of July here. So we factored that in. Maybe it's $0.015 to $0.02, but that's factored into our guidance.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So we should watch the weather for the balance of the quarter and think about that accordingly if it's above or below normal, because you're assuming normal?", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Correct.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Final question. In the normal cadence of your discussions with the Wisconsin Commission, at what point do you go into them and discuss whether or not you'd like to defer having a rate review again as you did this year?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. Well, my expectation would be, if we follow past practice on timing, typically if you're going to do a filing, so let's say, for example, if we're going to do a filing in 2017 for rates that we request to be in effect in 2018, typically in the March-April timeframe you really need to make that filing. So if we follow past practice with timing, my expectation would be that soon after the New Year, January, February, you'd need to have some conversations with the staff about where we would propose to head. So that's how I would see the timing.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So a ways off. Thank you, guys.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, Good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hello, Jonathan.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Two quick things. I heard your comments on the pension discount rate and I think you said you're working on building that into the plan, if you do see the $35 million increase in 2017. So should we take the comment of building it into the plant to mean you'd expect to absorb that within the stated growth rate?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. And I would say, maybe, to give you some additional color. The $35 million, part of that, to the extent that you capitalize labor expense and there is a certain amount of labor that gets capitalized when people do work on capital projects, now there'll be some amount of this $35 million that would effectively get capitalized as a part of that. My guess would be, right now, perhaps that $6 million or $7 million out of the $35 million, so not all of it would hit the income statement. But, yes, we'll have to and we expect to offset this as a part of our plan.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And then just on transmission return and how you've reserved, you mentioned the ALJ being 9.7% plus 50 basis point adder. Is that the number you've actually reserved to? And is that what you're looking on a go-forward basis or are those numbers different from what the ALJ?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, let me go through it in three pieces, because of course there are two investigations, if you will. So, there is the first period that goes from, I think, November 2013, help me Scott...", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure. February 2015.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. And then we've got...", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "February to May 2016.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "...2016. So in that first period, Jonathan, we're reserving I believe effectively the recommendation from the ALJ including the 50 basis points was 10.82%. So we're reserving at that level for that first period. For the second period, we're reserving at 10.2%, and then it's sort of an educated guess, but my view right now would be the that 10.2% is a pretty good assumption going forward and 10.2% is what we will assume when we build up our plan, when we finish our plan for 2017. I'm sorry, that's kind of a long answer, but there are all these players for these investigations.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "No, that was very helpful. Thank you for the clarity on that. It's sometimes hard to keep track of. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay?", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, that's all. Good, thanks a lot.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hello, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Just on the Illinois process, for the gas spending, just could you give a little more color on what is going to be kind of addressed in that process, just basically, let's finalize your new long-term investment plan?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and maybe let me sort of give this, maybe in parts. And let me first maybe just give a little more color about that staff report, Steve, that that was issued at the end of May. So really what that report did, effectively the staff did not make any recommendations about the program effectively. What they did is, that the staff summarized all of kind of the key input from the stakeholders in that workshop process that they had earlier this year. Then what the staff just essentially said is, well, we believe you should have a docket to address the program. And we think you should have reporting mechanisms about the program in the interim before you make a decision and in the long-term once the decision is made.", "So really it's just kind of summary of what all the stakeholders said, and then in terms of what the commission would decide, at a high level what they said they want to do was cover the cost, scope and schedule for the near-term and the long-term. So, they still seemed to be of a very strong view that the program needs to continue. They just want to look again at the scope and the schedule, and in the interim, they fully understand that we're going to continue with that three-year program that I alluded to before, hopefully that's helpful, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Yeah. No, that's helpful. Just one other question on the pension, thank you for disclosing that information. I assume we're going to start hearing a lot more from other people. The normal course I assume that's a recoverable expense in rate cases?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, FAS 87 expense would generally be recoverable in your revenue requirements.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And so, but just in 2017, to a degree you don't have a rate case you'd have to manage the cost?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Exactly right, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi there, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey.", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "So perhaps a easy question here, just the dollar-for-dollar comment on the Presque Isle. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the assets there are?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And I guess what I was really alluding to in the primary one or one of the ones is really escrow accounting, because sort of like when we talk about ROE investigations, these SSR agreements they were actually multiple agreements and they covered multiple periods. I think they go back as far as February of 2014.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Correct.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And there were actually two agreements over that period and some of these periods, Julien, were covered by escrow accounting, so you were actually required by the regulators in Wisconsin to escrow both revenues as well as costs, so both revenues you received under the contract as well as the costs that might be allocated back to our utility through MISO. So what I was really referring to primarily is that those escrow mechanisms that might cover one or both of the periods.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And just to be clear, I know this is Feb 14 through Jan 15, but would this have an ongoing impact just to 2016, 2017?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Because, the second SSR agreement, I believe ended in either February or April of 2015.", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "February of 2015.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "February of 2015, so this is all going back, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks for that. Little bit more strategic here. I know last time on the call we kind of discussed storage little bit. Can you elaborate where you stand on that and also in the interim we've seen some of your large-cap peers move more explicitly into the midstream sector, what are your thoughts owning storage in midstream more broadly?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. And I think, well, first off on the storage, we are having conversations with two parties who are owners of storage and we'll see what we can work out with one of those, but we are having active conversations with two parties so let me just sort of put a line under that. And then looking forward, I guess our view would be on midstream, at least our view is that we would only be interested in these other natural gas assets and I'll just call them, I don't know whether to call them midstream or what to call them, Julien, but it's certainly upstream of the local gas distribution companies. Our only interest at this point would be in gas storage and it would be gas storage that we could in effect directly integrate with our local distribution company and place in rate base. So at this point, that's as far upstream as we're thinking, it's something that would be very much of another regulated asset play.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. All right, great. Well, thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Brian.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Just curious, what was the second quarter 2016 EPS impact versus normal?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "In terms of weather impact.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Scott, do you want to cover that?", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The weather impact compared to normal, was about I think \u2013 all right, let me just pull our numbers up here. I think it was really only about $0.01.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. So, then I guess, the delta between what you actually reported and what you had guided to last quarter, is attributable to cost controls and the tech acquisition that's exceeding our expectations?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Initially as you recall on the first in April, it actually was a negative when we had the conference call, so we had earnings we thought were actually going to be down a little bit because of our April weather, and then as we covered then in the last part of the quarter here, so that helped us, so we had projected in our guidance a decline because of weather and then it turned round a little bit in the last part of the quarter here. And plus, we do have pretty good cost control and we saw some of our NIM decline a little bit.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got you. Okay. And then, in prior discussions you've mentioned that the people with gas pipeline replacement program has kind of physically maxed out on an annual basis, meaning just manpower or the amount of the street close at one time, et cetera. Can you comment on any of your other subsidiaries that have upside or headroom in some of their programs that can maybe fill in some of that CapEx that you're contemplating?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, and then maybe just to give a little bit, if you look at, we talked about gas storage and that's certainly if we made that kind of investment, we would see that being rate base for the two or really three Wisconsin local distribution companies. Outside of Wisconsin we would see quite a bit of opportunity in, let's say, at Minnesota, at Merck, Michigan, at MGU, those companies don't have automated meter. So, we could certainly \u2013 that would be a very cost effective investment that we can make at those two companies. Anything you'd add Scott?", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, and remember what we added was really in 2015 and 2016 so maybe some of those programs that we already have, some of that can continue into 2017 through 2018 and 2019 timeframe, but we're still evaluating those, what we have in that 2016, 2017 range.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And are you in a position to quantify maybe the gas reserve opportunity or the automated meters?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The automated meters, they're probably on the range of $30 million to $40 million I would say, at each of the companies. The gas storage, that's completely dependent, Brian on how many Bcf you could buy at what price. So, I'd hesitate to put a number yet on the gas storage, but as I mentioned we are having discussions.", "Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Michael.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, Allen. Couple of easy questions for you. First, how do you \u2013 you've got $35 million roughly, maybe a little less because of the capitalization of pension O&M headwind. You have the headwind tied to 50 basis point, 60 basis point lower ROE at ATC. Is your O&M, and you don't have rate increases coming at the Wisconsin utilities. Are your O&M cost savings enough to offset all of those things?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I believe so, but I would say at the Wisconsin utilities you're probably looking at having to have absolute declines in the O&M run rate. So, Scott, anything you'd like to add?", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. No, that's exactly the case. We'll have to continue at our cost control and manage every dollar like we have in the past. We'll also look at what we do on our financing cost, and we've put in there, maybe there is some investments we need to do in the pension plan also. So, we're evaluating a lot of different items items.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But at this point, Michael, I would say that we still would have enough degrees of freedom that \u2013 so we could move to help offset this.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And O&M sequentially, meaning quarter-over-quarter, because the year-over-year is just complex given the merger close. Quarter-over-quarter was down $5 million, $6 million. Is that kind of a decent run rate to think about the amount of O&M reduction you can take out in a certain period?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, there's a lot of variables between the first quarter and second quarter. For example, the riders we have in Illinois, the riders from Illinois, it's about $10 million more expense in the first quarter than in the second quarter. So, there's some timing of those type of non-controllable O&M that I would not say that's a constant run rate that's going to come out quarter-over-quarter.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. I have a question about 2016 guidance. If I take the midpoint of your guidance, so let's say $2.91. And then I take the midpoint of your third quarter guidance, so $0.57. And then I take what you've actually done year-to-date, so $0.57 in this period and $1.09 in the first period. That implies $0.68 for the fourth quarter, I mean, it's just subtraction. You did $0.66 last year in the fourth quarter, but last year, correct me if I'm wrong, you didn't have that much time or the benefit of the O&M savings, and you also had a little bit of an abnormally warm winter in the fourth quarter of last year, and you've become much more of a gas utility. Can you talk to me about what headwinds you may be facing in the fourth quarter of this year? Just because you're really implying really low growth year-over-year fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter 2016.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Michael, I'm going to let Scott sort of fill in more of the number detail. But I think basically right now, we're being conservative about weather in the fourth quarter, and Scott talked about we've got much more of our earnings better in the first quarter and the fourth quarter because of the natural gas companies. Obviously, those are weather sensitive. So we're being conservative about weather. And as you pointed out, even on the base that we had before without the Integrys companies, you could have some big swings based on weather. You want to fill in a little bit of detail on that, Scott?", "Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, sure. When you look at the weather, specifically in the fourth quarter, and look at scenario now with the larger gas footprint, there is with a warmer fourth quarter potential of $0.08 to $0.09 hit in the fourth quarter related to weather. So we're just being very \u2013 making sure we can measure and manage into that fourth quarter.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "But I want to make sure I understand that. Are you implying that your base plan and your base cost guidance assumes abnormal weather?", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, the guidance assumes normal weather, but I'm committed to meeting that range regardless of what happens with weather in the fourth quarter, Michael.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. I'll follow-up offline. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it.", "Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, that concludes our conference call. Thank you for participating. If you have any more questions, contact Beth Straka or Colleen Henderson. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Operator", "Good afternoon and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call for Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2016 Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.", "Now, as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share. Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment. Now, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 5% to 7% off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share.", "Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations. In addition to our full-year results, we have two other positive developments to share with you today. On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan.", "This facility can provide approximately one-third of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The total acquisition price is $230 million. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies.", "We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling. In this request, we will ask the Commission to confirm that is reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions. The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits. We chose the service agreement structure for two reasons.", "First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission in the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies. Second, this avoids directly involving our state regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business.", "The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, we filed for required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there. This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation or UMERC for short.", "UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission. We are proposing a $275 million investment in about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines. This will provide a reliable cost-effective long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources.", "We are targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduce carbon emissions.", "Turning now to the regulatory front. Last year, we only had one rate case. Now, this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million in line with our expectation.", "I also expect we will have another quite year on the rate case front. We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months. Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that we'll put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition. These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016.", "Turning to our ATC investment. On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%, and we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level.", "Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case. In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipating transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We factor this return into our long-term financial plan.", "Now, a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.", "I would now like to provide you with an update on our five-year capital forecast. Our five-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last five-year plan, which was $9.2 billion. I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed. These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint.", "We do have some news regarding ATC. On January 30, ATC announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative. The partnership known as ATC Southwest will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States.", "Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have three common elements, reducing the corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and eliminating interest expense of the deduction.", "These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company. I would like to address these in conceptual terms first, and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders. In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment.", "First let's look at the regulated utilities because of the traditional rate-making approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates. The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time. From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized.", "The second element, 100% expensing of capital, would reduce rate base in the short term. However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact. The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers. I view this as a large negative for customers. However, this would be neutral for shareholders.", "So, We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers. Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders. 100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward.", "The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power, if the change affects interest on existing debt. It is unknown if this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expenses. In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks or leasing entities.", "From the shareholders' perspective, there are three key issues, the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base, and deferred taxes at We Power. Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact. If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power. However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total. Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level.", "The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and non-deductibility of interest would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a five-year period. On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments.", "Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders. Although, this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation. As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration. Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it takes shape. But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed.", "So now with details on our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Allen. In 2016, our GAAP earnings grew $2.96 per share from $2.34 per share in 2015. Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include two quarters of Integrys earnings. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.64 per share in 2015 to $2.97 per share in 2016.", "For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing, and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.", "For 2016 results, I'll first focus on adjusted operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Integrys results for the first two quarters of 2016 are separated for comparability purposes. Referring to page 11 of the earnings package, our consolidated operating income for 2016 adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $1.6856 billion as compared to $1.3581 billion in 2015, an increase of $327.5 million.", "Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1.027 billion for 2016, an increase of $128.6 million from 2015 adjusted operating income. We realized a $128.4 million contribution from the Wisconsin Public Service during the first two quarters of 2016, with remaining increase related to favorable weather, positive fuel recoveries and rate increases at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Public Service, offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense.", "Operation and maintenance expense in 2016 included $24.4 million of expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas, which were effective January 1, 2016 and will last for three years. Under the earnings sharing mechanism, if either company earns above its authorized return, 50% of the first 50 basis points of additional utility earnings will be shared with customers, all earnings above the initial 50 basis points will benefit customers.", "In 2016, our Illinois segment recognized operating income of $239.6 million, an increase of $160.2 million compared to the $79.4 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $159.6 million of operating income during the first two quarters of 2016, and the remaining increase was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program. In 2016, our other states segment recognized operating income of $49.9 million, an increase of $43.8 million compared to the $6.1 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015.", "We recognized $34.1 million during the first two quarters of 2016. The remaining $9.7 million increase was mainly due to the rate increases at Minnesota Energy Resource Corporation and Michigan Gas Utilities as well as comparatively colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2016.", "Operating income at the We Power segment was up $2.2 million when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million in 2016, compared to the adjusted operating income of $800,000 in 2015.", "Lower operating income was driven in part by $1.4 million loss recognized by the Integrys companies during the first two quarters of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $327.5 million increase on adjusted operating income. During 2016, earning from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $146.5 million, an increase of $50.4 million from last year.", "Integrys results for the first two quarters of 2016 drove $39.6 million of the increase, leaving a comparable year-over-year increase of $10.8 million. Lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an administrative law judge initial decision in December 2015, related to the ATC ROE reviews, which was later affirmed by FERC order in 2016.", "Our other income net increased $21.9 million. The Integrys companies contributed $38.1 million of other income during the first two quarters of 2016. The offsetting $16.2 million decrease related to excise tax credits recognized by Integrys Transportation Fuels in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower AFUDC primarily related to timing of the capital expenditures. As you recall, Integrys Transportation Fuels was sold in the first quarter of 2016.", "Our net interest expense increased $71.3 million driven by $68.5 million of interest expense recognized by the Integrys during the first two quarters of 2016. The remaining $2.8 million increase was driven by interest on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the acquisition. This was offset in part by the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% Junior Notes in February 2016. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short-term debt.", "Earnings from the Integrys companies during the first two quarters of 2016 drove the $108.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $941.1 million or $2.97 per share for 2016, compared to $720.7 million or $2.64 per share for 2015.", "Net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by $655 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. We contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. In January 2017, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust.", "Our capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $157.5 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to inclusion of a full-year of capital investments at the Integrys companies. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of December, a decrease from the 53.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year.", "Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "We also paid $624.9 million in common dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of a $169.5 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in the shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to 2015.", "Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of December, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and 12,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota were serving approximately 16,000 more customers compared to a year ago.", "Now, let's discuss delivered sales volume year-over-year. For comparative purposes, 2015 electric sales information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Retail electricity deliveries excluding the iron ore mines increased 2%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity increased 0.2% compared to 2015.", "Looking at the individual customer segments, actual residential deliveries rose 4.1%, while weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 0.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, actual deliveries increased 2.3%, while weather-normalized deliveries increased 0.9%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2016 decreased 1.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries were flat year-over-year.", "Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation increased 1.6%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation were up 3.7% compared to 2015.", "Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. For 2017, we'll forecast and discuss delivered results for the State of Wisconsin, our largest segment. In Wisconsin, we're forecasting modest increase of 0.2% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine.", "Looking at 2017 by individual customer segment, we expect residential deliveries to decline 0.2%, impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts, but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to increase 0.5%. In the large commercial and industrial group excluding the mine, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. We project 2017 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase 0.5%.", "Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2017. As Allen mentions, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7% of a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. This is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectation. This guidance assumes normal weather. Again, our guidance for 2017 is $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share.", "Finally, let's look at the quarterly guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we earned $1.09 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 had warmer than normal weather, which was offset by fuel recoveries.", "In addition, there was a $0.04 pickup in the first quarter as a result of the repurchase, a portion of the Integrys 6.11% Junior Notes. Taking these into account and a mild January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share.", "With that, I will turn things back to Allen.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our conference call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, guys. Good afternoon.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Looking at 2017, looking at your margin walk, you had $38.9 million of margin in 2016 from weather, but then in excess of the earnings sharing mechanism, you also had a $33.4 million increase in O&M. So, as you think about 2017 in a normal weather scenario, should we be thinking about your ability to modulate O&M in order to still earn close to or at your targeted allowed return? And what are the factors that are sort of the puts and takes that get you into sort of a confidence range around a normal weather, meaning you can earn your authorized return?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. Good question, Greg. And I think maybe I'll just answer the question. It's kind of at a summary high level. The plan that we put together for 2017 would call for us to reduce O&M. So if you look at the 2016 run rate, the run rate in 2017 would be 3% below the level that it was at in 2016.", "Now, in addition to that Greg, as we have always done in previous years, weather is obviously uncertain, could be better or worse than normal, so we certainly have levers if you will above and below that 3% level, so that we can adjust our operations as we see weather that's either favorable or unfavorable. But the base plan would call for a 3% reduction in the level of O&M.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. What is the timeline for you engaging with the Public Service Commission and making a decision to either file for a general rate case this year, or decide mutually to defer that for another year?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So, I think you're referring to the Wisconsin Commission, and we...", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Yeah.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "...began engaging with their staff right after the holiday. So the first week of January, we started having discussions with them. In terms of a likely timetable, Greg, my view at this point would be, from traditionally if you're going to file a case, you're filing kind of the mid-to-late April, early May sort of timeframe. So, I think we certainly need to come to a resolution before, say, that mid-April timeframe. And I think we're on track to either be able to file a case although we don't think that's the best path or to let the mechanism that the Commission put in place continue to operate for at least another year.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Great. My last question is on, your last published slide deck is your January deck and you gave capital spending of 2020. If I start with 2017 averaging about $1.9 billion and then an incremental, your portion of ATC averaging, let's call it around $300 million over the similar timeframe, maybe a little less, the acquisition you're making of the storage fields, that is incremental to that plan or was that incorporated in that plan?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. The storage field will be incremental to that plan. And we'll have the new slide deck out shortly.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So, if you would have added that $200 million into your plan and we're to presume that you're going to earn out your authorized returns across all the jurisdictions and all the investments you're making over this period, where inside the sort of 5% to 7% earnings growth aspiration would you expect to be at this juncture?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Sure. And so, let me bridge back to the capital plan that I'd discussed kind of in the prepared remarks. So, if you take the $9.7 billion, what I would just call the more of the retail business, add the $1.4 billion for ATC inside the footprint and then, put on top of that the $300 million outside the footprint. Greg, I see that getting us kind of more of the low end of that 5% to 7% range. And then, what you'd need to do in order to kind of move up in that range, I'd say most likely would be to make some significant investment outside the footprint, the traditional footprint at ATC. But the capital plan that I described in the prepared remarks, very supportive of something kind of near that low end of the range.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thank you, guys. Have a great day.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Julien.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good afternoon, guys.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "How are you?", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Good. Thank you. Well, perhaps just a follow-up on Greg's question if you may. Can I ask \u2013 you alluded to ATC as being kind of another lever to get you higher up in that range? You also discussed on the call, if I heard right, a new JV effort. Is that something we should be paying attention to in terms of meaningful drivers in the ATC, is that an equation, or what would then ATC would be that prospect, or what geography are we talking about?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I would say, well, short answer is yes, you should be paying attention, Julien, because I think that Arizona, there are certainly a lot of needs for transmission in Arizona. So, I would say though in terms of most likely places that ATC could do things outside the footprint, Arizona is one of them and then going into the California market, because they're going to be looking. They still have very aggressive renewable goals, and they're going to be looking to import effectively renewable power in the California. So, I think the largest potential opportunities outside footprint are in the West and more likely the North Arizona and California.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. That's great. So then, maybe just turning back to the latest acquisition if you will, can you elaborate a little bit further, one, on the specific acquisition you just did, where will that be accounted for if it's outside the utilities, that's just going to be at a holdco kind of figure? And then separately, just to clarify a typical equity ratio, typical ROE on the full 200 and change number that you're acquiring this far.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. I think your description was very good, Julien, but maybe just let me review it for everybody on the call. So, what we would do, Bluewater Holding would be a first here subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. We would capitalize at approximately 50% equity, 50% debt. The equity would come from the parent, and then we would issue debt sort of on balance sheet, if you will, non-recourse debt down at that subsidiary.", "Equity return in the low 10%s is what you typically see right now for the Wisconsin utilities. So that's how we would structure it. And then you would have a collection of three service agreements back from Bluewater Holding, an agreement to each of the three Wisconsin LDCs.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And just to clarify, what's the tenure of the contract that we're talking about with between the new gas storage sub and your utilities? I know you guys want to make this utility like, so perhaps just emphasize...", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "...for us what that profile looks like, what the tenure is, and to what degree have you mitigated the risks.", "And then maybe let me throw it in while I got the mic here. The last question being, are there incremental opportunities either off of this existing asset that you're acquiring or further acquisition target both in Wisconsin or elsewhere that you would want to scale up this gas storage opportunities efficiently?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Okay. So, let me start with kind of the nature of the service agreements. So, when we'll lay this out in our declaratory ruling request, I mean literally in a matter of days, so we'll include in there the service agreements as we would propose them. In terms of tenure, Julien, we would actually propose 60-year agreements, so very long tenure agreements.", "And effectively what the agreement would provide for is a return on and of capital that's been invested, including the initial investment, and then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M of course and I think it'd be modest capital but if you had some additional capital that would be required at the field that would also be recovered kind of through that return of and on mechanism.", "So, we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling and there will be attachments to that. The service agreements will be attached to that ruling request. Getting kind of to the second question that you ask, additional opportunities, I believe in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 bcf in terms of working gas, that's about a third of our requirements.", "I do believe, you could do some additional expansion at the field and you could add some more working gas at the field. If you did that, that would be also covered by that service agreement, sort of structure that I mentioned. I think other than that for the Wisconsin utilities, there really aren't any other gas infrastructure things that we're looking at. So, hopefully...", "(39:44)", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. So, it's not that big of an incremental opportunity on the gas storage side, not looking to fully cover your needs, shall we say beyond the...", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah, it only covers the third of the needs, so there certainly would be room to do a bit more own storage in the future because it's only a third.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Right. But at the site principally not necessarily incremental?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "That's right.", "Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Excellent. Thank you for the time.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good afternoon, guys.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon.", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks for the extra color on tax and the detail there. I'm wondering can you \u2013 should we think about that \u2013 you obviously have framed the magnitude of how you see the impact to different pieces. Do you feel that these are within a framework that you would be able to work to offset through other means, be it cost or investment, or is this kind of a net look?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. Well, I think maybe I'll talk about in terms of the shareholder impacts. When we talked about rate base, it was a cumulative impact of $300 million on rate base and again that's cumulative over a five-year period. So, I would certainly view that on a company of this size, there certainly would be other opportunities that we could pull forward or identify that would help offset that $300 million.", "So, I think from a rate base standpoint, I'd certainly think that's manageable. Not much to say about the deferred tax impact at We Power, that would be a shareholder benefit, and that kind of leaves interest deductibility.", "And I think I would just stress to you Jonathan and everybody on the call, all this that we put into the earnings deck, it's bit of a speculative enterprise, I mean we're just trying to give people a sense for the impacts. On the interest deductibility front, if you take one extreme where it's still deductible but at a 20% level, well, that's $0.05 a share on a base of say circa $3, so that'd be fairly small and I would expect that that's probably manageable.", "As you start getting the things more like $0.15, that'd be tougher for us to manage. But as I look at it, I mean it's not a foregone conclusion, but that's where they're headed in terms of how this would be structured. Does that help?", "Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "No, that's helpful. Thank you. And my other question was answered. So, I will see you. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Dan.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi. Good afternoon. I also had a couple questions just around the tax, if the tax law changes, and it's more in terms of your capital structure. I've seen a number of studies saying that as tax rates go down or as tax interest deductibility becomes less of an issue, companies tend to have less leverage. Have you thought at all about any impacts on your capital structure strategy particularly, in terms of how you would capitalize your utilities for rate filings and so forth in terms of debt to equity ratios and so forth?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I've not thought about that a great deal at this point, Dan. But I think look if you basically or Congress makes changes in the tax that effectively changes the after-tax cost of the different components, you'd most certainly have to rethink what's the best capital structure for the utilities. But quite candidly, I haven't gotten to that level yet in my thinking.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then I just want to make sure on your page 18, where you show these preliminary estimates that I understand your note there under the holding company. We were saying that's only a change in rate and not additive so...", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. Scott, do you want to take the answer to that?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. And the reason for the note is, if there would be only a change of rate, it would be the $0.05 that we talked about at the holding company. When you go down the holding company page, if non-deductibility of interest would happen, it would be $0.14, so it's not additive. I don't want someone to go and add the $0.05 and $0.14 together, it's either $0.05 or $0.14, which once again, Allen talked about the non-deductibility of interest and where that would actually go.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. So you would use one or the other, but not...", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Correct.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "They're not netted in anyway.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Correct.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. I also had a question around debt. I guess, you saw the Bloomberg is changing rules for inclusion of debt issuance in their indices and a large number of your issues are going to fall out of the index given that they are at currently at a size of $250 million. I guess how do you expect to respond to that, while you tend to issue larger sizes going forward or do you think you still have adequate access to the debt markets if you issue at $250 million or have you thought about that?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So, that's a good question. And we'll be looking at as debt issuances come due. Probably we'll look at it in a couple of ways. One, there may be an opportunity to open some of the existing debt and get it at that larger level, so keep it at the index level. We will also look at, should we issue in larger amounts and maybe have to look at our CP program overall. But we've been very successful at the smaller utilities, even issue under the index size debt. So we've been successful either way. But we'll evaluate them as they come due and what's the most efficient to execute them.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then the last question I had is around the numbers on page 10 and 11. You had fairly sizable impacts in Wisconsin related to O&M that even after excluding the earning sharing. I was wondering if you could give some more color on what happened there in the fourth quarter in particular.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. In order to really look at the fourth quarter O&M, you really have to take a step back to 2015. So in 2015 as you recall, we had an extremely warm fourth quarter, and in that fourth quarter, we had to really look at our O&M expenses. And in the end, we had to control O&M expenses to get to our authorized return. And when you look at this year, we're just getting back to running the normal O&M in the projects that we were doing. There may be some timing between the third and fourth quarter, but we've really looked at the total expense over the entire year. So, there is a little more O&M, specifically in this fourth quarter, but it was exaggerated by what we did last year in 2015. But overall, we're able to hit our authorized return in all the jurisdictions. And like Allen mentioned, next year, we're looking about 3% reduction in total O&M.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Thank you.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Zhou (48:00) with Avon Advisors (sic) [Avon Capital]. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "(48:04)", "Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners", "Thank you, guys. Hey. No, it's actually Andy Levi. How are you?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hey, Andy.", "Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium Partners", "I had a question on the growth rate, but I think you guys were very clear on that. So I'm all set. Thank you very much.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Andy.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Andy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, guys. I'm actually going to pick up where Andy just left off. Can you talk about how many \u2013 I know you're talking about 3% O&M down in the 2017 over 2016, so 2016 O&M was almost $2.2 billion. So, that's a pretty sizable chunk of O&M reduction. Do you see multiple years of this? I mean we've seen some of your peers go to mergers. One of the East Coast utilities did an acquisition or did a merger with a peer and they've been able to do four or five years of 2% to 3% O&M reductions. Just curious if you see that kind of runway ahead for cost saves, that would benefit both shareholders and other stakeholders including customers?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. Well, I think in terms of being able to continue to maintain O&M reductions, I do believe we'll have additional capacity to reduce O&M, Michael. But I would say, as you look out say to 2018, 2019, 2020, which I think is kind of more where you're going, the larger reductions in O&M are most likely going to be centered around our generation portfolio as we restructure that generation portfolio.", "And let me just give you one example in particular, bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in the UP. Well, once we have that new generation online, and we're able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle, it's about $40 million a year, which very, very significant both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity.", "So, I do believe, there'll be additional opportunities, but the really big opportunities in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side. There will be more modest, not unimportant but more modest opportunities and say, we implement our new ERP system, so now we're going through efforts where we're trying to get all of our utilities on common systems. So, as we implement our new ERP system in this year and in 2018, I would see more savings opportunities there, but that's a little more modest.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And one follow-up just on the Bluewater Gas acquisition, the gas storage acquisition. Can you all remind us where are your gas utilities currently buying storage from? And how should we think about what the impact of this, if you assume like a utility like return, what the impact of this is for the customer?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So right now, the largest single, say, third-party provider of storage is ANR. So, ANR is the largest single provider. I believe that they provide about 40% of the storage or thereabouts for the operating companies, so that's the biggest one Michael.", "As the service agreements would be put in place, if you look at it from a present value standpoint, okay, so cover all the return of capital, cover all those costs, we would see roughly a $213 million net present value savings to customers. And in terms of the year where you would see an absolute reduction due to this, I think that's in year four, so pretty quickly gets to annual reduction in rates, and any increase in the early years, it's less than 1%, but present value, that's $200 million-plus \u2013 $213 million net present value, so very significant savings that we would see. Does that help Michael?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That helps a lot. And one last one, I apologize for the short list here. First quarter guidance and I know weather has not been so wonderful January to date, but first quarter guidance seems a little tepid. Can you talk a little bit about, given you're much more gassy now than you were pre-Integrys, what that means in terms of your kind of where you think you'll fall within 2017's range, if it has any impact at all and maybe how you're thinking about how kind of \u2013 and I know you've touched on this a little bit, but kind of how you're thinking about the broader growth of the company over time, multi-years out?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. And Scott, why don't you address Michael's question about the first quarter?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So the first quarter, you're correct Michael, the month of January right now is about 12% warmer than normal. It's like the seventh warmest in the last 57 years, so it's a pretty warm January. So, we did have an entry last year that took that $1.9 down to about $1.05. So if you take some weather of $0.01 or $0.02, we're kind of in the middle of the range that we provided. But it's really early in the year to say how that's going to affect our overall guidance, like Allen mentioned, we have a lot of O&M that we look at and monitor and we manage the business to get to our log (54:12) returns.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. And then I think Michael, in terms of longer-term growth, I addressed that in the script and also talked a little bit about it in the response to Greg Gordon's question, was there any other aspect specifically about that that you want me to cover?", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "No, just kind of thinking about whether you see your electric business or your gas business, which of those two being a higher growth business and is the spread between the two significant? Are we talking about pennies or nickels, not dimes and quarters?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. Well, in terms of \u2013 and let me talk about that in terms of capital allocation, if you will. So if you look at the five-year capital budget, just that half, in fact, maybe a little over half of the capital that we would expect to commit over the next five years is in the natural gas distribution business. So, given that the natural gas distribution as measured by rate base is about a quarter of the company, right now. In terms of percentage growth, we're going to see much greater or expect to see much greater percentage growth in earnings in the natural gas business than we would in electric. But in terms of absolute capital employed, it's almost even, electric versus gas. But in terms of percentage growth, most of it's going to come from gas we would expect.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you, Allen. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Michael.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, Jim.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Hey, how are you?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good.", "James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "My questions have been asked and answered. Thank you, guys.", "Allen L.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.", "Now, as you saw this morning, we recorded first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance. Effective cost controls, better than forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities help to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.", "Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front. On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Due to the terms of the settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018, as well as 2019. This will make for a total of four years that base rates will be flat.", "This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019, and require us to continue to manage our cost aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earning sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for two years.", "Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on the equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers.", "We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. Currently, 24 customers including three of our largest customers have signed the settlement agreement. We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supportive. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs.", "These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms. The Commission formerly began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 28. Now, settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin, but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously.", "I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process. In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment. Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the Commission to consider and decide on June 1.", "Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin.", "The earnings from this investment as well as this risk profile are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring a very meaningful benefits to our customers.", "In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well. We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27.", "No substantive issues or concerns have been raised, and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project, if approved by the Michigan Commission. As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements which the commission approved. We would welcome a similar outcome in this case.", "Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program. The commission has requested that the record in the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision. And I expect an order in the fourth quarter.", "Finally on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder to being a member of MISO, thus increasing its return on equity to 10.82%. We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring its return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan. We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns.", "Now, just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents the compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.", "Now, with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer than normal weather. The weather impact in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.04 a share less compared to normal weather. As you recall, our guidance in the first quarter was $1.02 to $1.06 per share. Our guidance already reflected about a $0.02 per share decrease related to the warm January weather.", "The continued warm weather in February and normal weather in March was offset by better-than-expected electric fuel recoveries in the quarter due to lower natural gas prices. With the warmer weather, we saw less maintenance in our field operations that allowed us to allocate resources to capital work. In addition, we aggressively managed costs with the continuation of warmer weather. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2017 and first quarter 2016 results.", "I'll first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 6 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $617.3 million as compared to $589.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $28 million.", "Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the first quarter increased $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expense was $28.4 million lower. This was mostly offset by the mild winter temperatures.", "In the first quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating increase of $18.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense, and to a lesser expense continued investment in the gas system modernization program.", "The mild weather did not have a significant of an impact on our Illinois margins due to the decoupling in the jurisdiction. Operating income in our other states segment improved $1.6 million due in part to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures and decoupling at our Minnesota operations.", "Operating income at the We Power segment was up $4.1 million when compared to first quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power the Future plans since the first quarter of 2016.", "The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased $900,000. Taken the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $28 million increase in the operating income. During the first quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million compared to the first quarter of last year.", "Other income net decreased by $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $155 million of Integrys 6.11% Junior Subordinated Notes at a discount, which contributed approximately $0.04 per share. Interest expense increased $3.8 million quarter-over-quarter, this was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher short-term rates.", "Our consolidated income tax is relatively flat compared to last year. As a reminder, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31st, 2017. A reduction in working capital was partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.", "Looking at the cash flow statement on page 5 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $329.7 million in the first quarter, a $17.7 million increased compared to the first quarter of 2016, as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.", "Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of March, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "We also paid $104.1 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.9 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase to the dividend rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.", "Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago.", "Sales volume quarter-over-quarter are showing on the earnings package on page 8, weather normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2017 were slightly above our expectations.", "Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share. This projection assumes normal weather for remainder of the year. We are off to a strong start, however, it is early in the year and we have a lot of weather ahead of us.", "Finally, we'd like to address the second quarter earnings per share guidance. We expect our second quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.60 per share.", "With that, I'll turn things back to Allen.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott. So we'll now begin the question-and-answer period. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "A couple of questions. So, the quantum of O&M reduction you saw on the quarter, was that a function of rationing down O&M in the quarter relative to understanding where your margin was coming in? When we look at Q2 versus Q2 O&M or balance of year O&M versus balance of year O&M, how should we think about those numbers going forward? I mean, clearly it would be a huge assumption to use the current base of O&M as a run rate.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So, Greg, I think as we look at our plan for 2017, our plan was to bring O&M down 3% in 2017 relative to the actual run rate in 2016, and that's still our plan. But given how extraordinarily warm it was in January and February, we use, what I've talked about before, our flex down process to basically flex down spending to preserve our margins in the phase of the very, very warm weather. So, I think 3% down year-over-year on O&M is still a good assumption sort of on a whether normalized basis, so to speak, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "So if your Q2 through Q4 numbers were to come in and theoretically on the plan, the O&M numbers quarter-over-quarter over for the balance of the year would be in that direction and magnitude?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah, yes, the 3%. That's right.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Got you. Moving down to the WE Power line, you saw $4.1 million improvement in operating income from higher capital investment. How should we think about how those numbers are going to trend over the balance of the year? Is that going to be at a sort of a $16 million improved operating income run rate because of higher capital, or was that for some reason lumpy in the quarter?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "It was a little lumpy as we put those projects in, in the storage, the coal storage, and fuel blending. So, overall though, that should continue through the year.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. So not in the $4 million run rate, but there will be incremental earnings in each subsequent quarter that approach that increased amount?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah, it will be an increased in each of the future quarters compared to the prior year.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "That, we just put it in service in January this year at the end of last year.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Can you remind me what the total capital investment was, as you were in sort of a pretty consistent return on investment -", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah, it was just under $60 million.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "$60 million. Okay. I have some other questions, I'll go to back in the queue. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hey, Allen and Scott, how are you?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Shar.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "How are you?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good. Good.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Is there an update on the Arizona co-op situation, and as well as Alaska? Is there any updates on wires opportunities there right now?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So, Shar, those are just maybe a context for the others on the call, those were areas that American Transmission Company was targeting for development kind of outside their traditional footprint. In Arizona, they are working. They are looking at the feasibility of the number of transmission projects. My expectation is later this year. Can't really give you a specific date at this point, but they're actively looking at I think four different projects, and they would be prepared to propose some of those later this year in Arizona. And in Alaska, I don't have any update for you at this point in Alaska.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay, got it. And then just on the Arizona, is that incremental to what you have as a placeholder, or would that be supportive of that?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "It would be the latter, Shar. So we had $300 million of capital for what we called outside the footprint in the five-year plan. So whatever they propose there would be supportive of that $300 million.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Helpful. And then just lastly, I know obviously with your carbon reduction goals, you've talked about additional coal retirements. Can you sort of just, is there an update on how you're thinking about additional retirements and what the read-through could be for additional O&M savings as well as incremental gas needs?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, there's nothing at least in terms of additional requirements, other than the retirement of Presque Isle we talked about, which is about a 360-megawatt coal unit. We've also talked about the retirement of Pulliam, which is a coal unit in Green Bay in the WPS Service Territory.", "So, other than those two retirements, I don't have anything additional to announce. I would tell you though, Shar, if you look at kind of our carbon reduction goal and maybe describe it in terms of annual tons of reduction, so what we ultimately would like to see is about a $14 million annual run rate reduction in CO2, and based on the things that we've already announced, so the Pulliam and Presque Isle, and the things that we've done at our gas plants, you could get roughly $7 million out of that $14 million. So based on what we've already announced, you could get $7 million out of that $14 million, and those actions \u2013 not only would they reduce carbon, but they also would be a net savings to customers.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay, excellent. I'll jump back in the queue. Congrats on the results.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Shar.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I was just wondering if you could talk about something you discussed last quarter. On the call in response to a question you talked about your capital plan supporting growth in the lower half or towards the lower end of the 5% to 7% range, and I was just wondering if you could remind us if there's a timeframe associated with this growth target, or if it's more indefinite?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So what we've said, and this is something that I've mentioned at least on a couple calls before this one, didn't go into as much detail on it on this call, but we look at a base of earnings in 2015 of $2.72 per share. And, Caroline, basically that $2.72, it effectively, it's like a pro forma number for the company as if we had never done the Integrys acquisition. Okay.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Right.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "So we set that base of earnings at $2.72 in 2015, and what we've said as a long-term matter is sort of think of an envelope where the bottom end of the envelope is a 5% compound annual growth off $2.72, and then 7% is the upper end of the envelope. What we said, as a long-term matter, we expect our actual earnings, the trajectory, to be in that envelope. So that's really how we've laid out our goal.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So it's more of an indefinite kind of through 2020 and beyond type of timeframe than just through 2019?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah, I would characterize it as long-term; I'm not sure anything is indefinite, but...", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "...but it's certainly long term.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then just kind of on another note, I was just wondering if you could comment on to what extent earnings sharing mechanisms impacted the Q1 result?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Scott, do you want to address that?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "It did not affect the Q1 results at all.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "You said did not?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "We weren't into a \u2013 it did not.", "Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks very much.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hello, Michael.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, Allen. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. So, when we think about the rest of the year for O&M, because you were down far more than 3% in the first quarter, should we assume a lower decline rate for the rest of the year, or simply that the remaining quarters you kind of stay near that 3% range, so you may actually kind of beat your expectations on O&M management just due to a really good start to the year?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah, yeah, my expectation at this point, Michael, and of course, I can't sit here today and say whether it's going to be for the rest of the year, but if you had sort of a normal weather for the rest of the year, I still think for the year, we'd be down 3% on a O&M. We would stick pretty close to that plan, if we had normal weather. If, for some reason, it's warmer or cooler than normal, well, I expect we'd adjust.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Can I ask just a very basic question, when weather impacts O&M, what are the things that change, like when you're sitting around and it's February and we're not having winter, what is that that actually changes versus what you're thinking you are going to do on December 31st, heading into the year versus what you actually do?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So, when you think about the weather, there's a couple of things, when you have consecutive warm weather like January was one of the warmest and February was the warmest, we're actually able to just reduce some O&M expenses because the actual number of leaks and coal outs where the frost the line is really \u2013 naturally reduces some O&M. And then, when we see that warm weather, everyone in the company like Allen talked about, we have our flex lists and we react to that and make sure that we can control our cost to offset the weather decline.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you. CapEx in the quarter, so if I think about your full year guidance for CapEx of just over $2.1 billion and yet CapEx in the quarter was south of $350 million and you normally wouldn't do a ton on the electric side in the middle of the summer, should we assume this is very back-end loaded this year, or is there something where CapEx could be lower this year and bigger in future years?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, it's the first quarter, so we still have the winter season, so it's not the largest construction for us, unless we're finishing up our prior year project. So, the first quarter isn't the biggest construction, and remember, some of the construction we have and if the \u2013 we talk about including the storage field that we're looking at purchasing, that's in the back half of the year, so it's a little bit back-end loaded.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. And then finally, I know you've got the settlement outstanding, and I just want to make sure I understand what is the Commission's process for reviewing and potentially approving the settlement, and what are the roles that the interveners who did not sign the settlement, what do they play in this process?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Okay. Well. Let me just maybe as background for everybody, settlements, Michael, are quite uncommon in commission history \u2013 in Wisconsin Commission history. So as a result, there is no prescribed settlement process in Wisconsin. And in some other states, you have some statutorily prescribed process for a settlement, you don't really have that here. So each settlement can be approached maybe in a somewhat different fashion. Sitting here today, I talked about the fact that the PSCW gave official notice of the proposed settlement on April 20. They indicated that they would soon set a date for a prehearing conference, and then if things work the way they usually work, Michael, they'd solicit comments after they do that prehearing conference. And then, they'll have to decide what process they want to use after that.", "But I would just reiterate, I mean there is very broad customer support for the settlement. So the 24 industrial customers that I talked about including the three largest customers that we have. Now, in terms of the role that other interveners would have, at this point, it's hard for me to say, and I mean I would assume they'd be like any other party in a contested proceeding. So, they wouldn't be any different than how they typically would be in a contested proceeding. That will be my expectation at least.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. I was just thinking through it because two of the large groups that are normally part of the process weren't signatory to your stipulation. So, just trying to think through how they factor in all of those.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. Well, one of those, and I think you're referring to the two permanent intervener groups. One of those permanent intervener groups is what I think of was a trade association, many of whose members actually individually supported the settlement. And then you've got another permanent intervener group called CUB, which is not really a trade association, but I think their remit is to represent residential customers largely.", "Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it, got it. Thank you, Allen. Much appreciate the insight, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Paul.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good afternoon. Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Any update on the legislation around Power the Future and where does that stand?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right. Well, I think where it stands, it was referred to an assembly committee, which of course is the lower house of the legislature, then it was also referred to a senate committee. At this point, there've been no hearings that have been scheduled at a committee level. So, that's where it stands, Paul.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you. When does the legislative session end?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Paul, I believe they're in session until at least the end of May, and of course this is a budget year, so I'm not sure they can go home until they have a budget. But I think it's that the end of May, Paul, but we can get you a more precise answer offline.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Is the budget discussion contentious?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I'm not sure, I would just call it any more or less contentious than Wisconsin budgets have been. Unlike other states, they consistently have a budget.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "All right. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Dan.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Yes. My first question kind of relates to the energy sales shown on pages 8 and the bottom of page 7. It looks like the 2017 normalized versus 2016 normalized, you have a nice pickup in the small commercial industrial area...", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. That's correct.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "...particularly in Wisconsin on and then on the gas side. So, I was wondering is that something that we should anticipate it's going to continue, or you could give us a little more color on what's going on there?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Sure. Yeah, the small class in our electric sales on a weather normalized basis, we calculate it to be up 1.4%. Now, like we talked about the quarter, it was extremely warm this quarter. So, normalization in this sector and all sectors is pretty tricky, especially when you're talking, with commercial, there is a variety of different commercial operations there. So, the class has always been a little stronger for us. And in our long-term forecast, we have about a 0.5% year here at for next year \u2013 for this coming year. So, it was a good quarter, but once again, it was only one quarter, I'd still look at overall being about 0.5%. And that's what I see in high class.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Then you also mentioned you had a $100 million pension contribution in the first quarter. I was wondering if you could just update us on sort of where you're kind of on pension funding, and should that like satisfy your needs for the next few years or how should we think about that payment?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. So yeah, we evaluate the pension, as you know, every year in March, intensely during the year, it gets us to be about fully funded about a 100% on a GAAP basis. So, we don't see any contributions in the near-term, but of course we'll continue to evaluate.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then, I just wonder if you could update us on the debt financing plans in terms of timing?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Sure. So we have a couple debt financing plans this year. One, first, we're looking at putting debt versus intercompany debt down at our Minnesota and Michigan subs. So we're looking at that financing. So that is one item that we'll be doing. Another financing, and that'll probably each be around $100 million each. So those financings we'll be working on this year.", "We'll also be looking at \u2013 continue some debt at our gas utility, Peoples Gas, with the continued construction program. So that'll be happening this year also. Of course when we look, at with the purchase of Bluewater, there's potential financing with that also. And then we continue to monitor all the large electric utilities, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Public Service, potentially, one, we'll have to monitor that as we go through the year.", "Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi, Allen. So, just on the rate settlement filing, so you mentioned the commission is going to be setting a prehearing; they still have not set the date of that yet?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Steve, to my knowledge at this point, they have not set a date for the prehearing conference.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And how long can this process go before you need to kind of make your normal rate filing?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, my view right now, Steve, would be that I'm going to wait for the commission to take some definitive action, either a definitive action that they approve the settlement or a definitive action that they reject the settlement. I think financially, we're just fine waiting for that definitive answer.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "So we'll wait. As I was saying in the prepared comments, I do think they'll act expeditiously, but there's just no prescribed process, so -", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. And then just in terms of like \u2013 someone asked about other parties \u2013 just I assume you probably talk to other parties. Just do you expect some of them to oppose the settlement or you just got to wait and see what happens?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I think we really have to wait and see what happens. At this point, the interventions, they've raised their hand and intervened, but without even having had the prehearing conference, it's hard to know what their positions are at this point.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess just any update you may have given us and I missed it just on the Illinois Gas Infrastructure Investment Program?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. And I did touch on it just briefly, but maybe just as kind of a review and summary. My expectation sitting here today is that we'll deploy about $300 million worth of capital over the course of the entire year on the S&P program. The Illinois Commission has asked for \u2013 going back to the workshop proceedings, remember that they had last year \u2013 they've asked for some additional information, I believe our deadline for filing is the middle part of May for that additional information, and additional briefs. And they've indicated that they would decide this year, so that's where we are with that process. But in the interim, we're continuing with the program, as we laid out in our three-year plan to them.", "Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, Leslie.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Hi, Allen. You said for the quarter that one of the things that had you come in above your guidance with better-than-expected fuel recoveries. Could you just walk through how that -", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. Right, on the electric side. Scott, do you want to talk about and go through that?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Sure. So, going into the quarter, we were anticipating that gas prices were a little bit higher. They actually were a little bit higher. And then with the continued \u2013 so we thought the recoveries would be a little bit less about $0.02 worth, and then as the warm weather continued, our natural gas prices went down and, in fact, our fuel recovery at both of the utilities came in slightly better than we anticipated, just because of the price of the electricity on the market and running our plants with the natural gas.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "So does that get trued up over the course of the year?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, you have a fuel band at both of the utilities, so that's the plus or minus 2%, so our outlook at this point, Leslie, would be that given normal weather, we would expect to be about fully recovered at each of the utilities, again for electric fuel.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "But not ahead of plan?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "No. At this point, I wouldn't project to be ahead of plan.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Okay.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Or ahead of fully recovered.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Correct. Right.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Right. Right. Right. And then just on the C&I side, frac sand, fracking is starting to pick up again if you've seen, you've done some gas infrastructure in Western Wisconsin in 2014, 2015. I'm just wondering if you're sort of seeing any uptick in activity in that regard?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. We're starting in the first quarter, when you look at first quarter 2017 versus 2016, we are seeing a slight uptick in that frac sanding sector. So, it's nice growth. Remember, frac sanding is, I think when you look at our sales of the gas side in Wisconsin excluding residential, it's between 1.5% and 2% of sales, so it's a nice grouping and we did see a nice little uptick there.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "So just more broadly then on C&I, on the electric side, your mines \u2013 the mining activity was down pretty heavily, was that the iron ore mines?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. That is correct. So, those are the iron ore mines that \u2013 that's what we look at with and without those.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Right, okay. And then just broadly speaking the rest of the C&I business on the electric side across your jurisdictions is roughly flat on a weather normal basis?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. The large C&I, that has been relatively flat just \u2013 once again the economy is \u2013 it's moving a little bit, but those sales have been very flat in the last several months, quarters.", "Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Leslie.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "The iron ore mines, are these the mines that are going to eventually close and they're just kind of ramping down here, which mines are these?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yeah. So, there are the two large mines in the UP of Michigan. So, these are the Cliffs Resources mines. So, Paul, and I always mix up the names, but one of the mines is roughly a third of the usage up there, and that's the one if you remembering is going down into shutdown. The other mine which is about two-thirds, which is the Tilden mine, that's the larger of the two and that's the one at least the Cliffs has indicated that they're going to run for the long term.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Is it the impact we are seeing now is the one that's permanently closing?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Correct. Correct. I think that actually was closing last fall, previously, it was shut down \u2013 I think it's actually closed now.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And the Tilden never scaled back operations and they're going to ramp and back up another sales recovery and what's the dynamic there?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, I think and I didn't listen to their call, their earnings call, but my understanding at least is, if they see an uptick in demand, could they sell to steel mills obviously, if they see an uptick there, they would be poised to increase production, but otherwise, I think they're going to be pretty flat, would be my expectation.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "All right. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Allen Leverett for closing remarks.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, operator. Well, thank you all for joining us today.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.", "Now, as you saw this morning, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.63. Effective cost controls and warmer than normal June weather contributed to a solid second quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment.", "We are affirming our current 2017 guidance of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.", "Now, I would like to update you on our major investments and several developments on the regulatory front. On June 30, we closed the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the investment. This $230 million investment in natural gas storage will provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin Natural Gas Distribution companies.", "Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of these three companies. The earnings and risk profile from this investment are expected to be essentially the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers.", "You may recall on April 4, we filed a proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Now under the terms of the settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 and 2019. This would make a total of four years that base rates will be flat, and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The settlement also requires that we continue to manage our costs aggressively.", "Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and at Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. There would be equal sharing between customers and shareholders of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services' allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% would go back to benefit customers.", "As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses, and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under existing terms. The settlement has the support of a board cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. In addition, state legislative leaders are supportive.", "The Commission began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Then on May 25, Wisconsin Commission staff issued a schedule outlining the key dates. On July 19, the Wisconsin Commission staff issued a memorandum in response to our proposed rate-freeze settlement. Staff's review confirmed an electric revenue deficiency, and thus in my view, demonstrated that the settlement we arrived at with our customers remains in the best interest of all of our customers. However, the staff proposed a wide range of conditions to the settlement. Unfortunately, none of these conditions are acceptable to us.", "Looking forward from today, comments to the staff memo are due on August 2. Reply comments are due on August 8. We expect the Commission to make a decision on the proposed settlement in the late August to September timeframe. Should the Commission reject the proposed settlement, I expect we will file a traditional rate case.", "In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is progressing well. We anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval within the 270-day statutory deadline which ends on October 27. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project. If approved by the Michigan Commission, we expect this to be a $265 million investment.", "Turning to Illinois, we continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. This program is designed to make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Consistent with our plan, we expect to invest $300 million in the program this year.", "Now, a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.", "Finally, here in Wisconsin, we're seeing some promising economic activity with state's per capita real GDP is growing faster than the U.S. average. Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 3.1% in May, the lowest it has been since 1999 and well below the U.S. average of 4.3%. In Southeastern Wisconsin in particular, there are a number of active ongoing projects. Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and the financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 second quarter earnings increased to $0.63 per share from $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Effective cost controls continued to have a positive impact on earnings. We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter which, as you recall, was $0.56 to $0.60 per share. Lower than expected cost at our Illinois utilities and longer than normal June weather contributed to these results.", "The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results. My focus will be on the quarter beginning with operating income by segment, and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 7 of our earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $362.2 million as compared to $332.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $30.1 million.", "Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter increased $8.9 million from the second quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operation and maintenance expense was $29.1 million lower. This was largely offset by lower customer usage related to mild weather conditions in April and May. In the second quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $18.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense and continued investment in the Gas System Modernization Program. Operating income in our Other segment improved $2.4 million related to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures.", "Following last month's acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, our We Power segment was renamed the Non-Utility Energy segment. For the second quarter, operating income at the Non-Utility Energy segment was up $4.6 million. This increase reflects the additional investment in our Power the Future plan since the second quarter of 2016.", "Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, this segment also will include the results of Bluewater. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $30.1 million increase in operating income.", "During the second quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million compared to the same period of the prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of the ALJ recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews.", "Other income net decreased by $19.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Driving the decrease was a $19.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of Wisvest. Interest expense increased $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower capitalized interest.", "Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. However, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was down 1.8% when compared to the same period last year due largely to the settlement of several items. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $199.1 million or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.", "Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. A reduction in the working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.", "Looking at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $790 million in the first half of 2017, a $171.3 million increase compared to the first half of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. I want to remind you, we also invested $230 million through our acquisition of Bluewater. However, this investment is identified as a separate line on the cash flow statement.", "Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of June, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinate Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.", "We paid $328.3 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2017, an increase of $15.9 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2016.", "Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 13,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 11 and page 12 of the earnings package respectively.", "On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, normalized sales results for natural gas were above our expectation and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations.", "Turning now to our earnings forecast. As Allen mentioned, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share, with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.", "Finally, I'd like to address the third quarter earnings per share guidance. As a reminder, during last year's third quarter, we earned $0.68 per share. This included $0.01 of acquisition cost to arrive at adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share. Earnings that quarter were primarily driven by weather that was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin and related positive fuel recoveries that were partially offset by Wisconsin sharing mechanisms. These items add approximately $0.07 to the quarter of 2016 to arrive at a base of $0.62 per share. Taking these into account, we expect our third quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.", "With that, I'll turn things back to Allen.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Scott. Operator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session portion of our conference call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "All right, thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hello, Greg.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "How are you?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "I just want to understand sort of procedurally what the potential scenarios are at the Commission with regard to the Staffs' suggestions, right? So, they basically said, A, approve the deal as filed, which is clearly your preference. Another one is, reject it and have them file the rate case, which is pretty obvious. But the third path is not so clear to me. If the Commission were to say, we accept the settlement, but imposed the conditions that the Staff had opined be implemented, at that point, could you say, we'd rather file a rate case? Or would you be then compelled to accept that decision?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, we'd not be compelled to accept the decision, so maybe just to state for everybody on the call to make sure they understand your question. So basically, you have a scenario, Greg, where the Commission says well, all right, we accept the settlement subject to the addition of some or all of the conditions that the Commission staff propose, so that's the hypothetical scenario.", "Well, in that scenario, given the way the settlement was structured, it's not severable. So if it's not accepted in whole, well, the settlement basically falls away unless we and the other parties who came up with the settlement, unless we all agree to a different set of conditions. So, we wouldn't be compelled, Greg, in the scenario you lay out to accept that modified settlement, if you will. And as I described in the opening remarks, the next step would be, we'd file a general rate case.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. That's what I thought. I just wanted to hear you state that so that it was clear because looking at the conditions, they were clearly put \u2013 they seem to, at least some of them, put a lot more pressure on unit control costs by virtue of not allowing you under certain of those conditions to continue to defer costs and by reducing the amount you could earn on significant regulatory asset balances, right? So, it would seem to me that unless you had \u2013 were able to pull off some herculean effort vis-\u00e0-vis cost cutting, there would be the potential for some significant regulatory lag under that scenario. Is that fair?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. I agree with that description.", "Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI", "Okay. That was my only question. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Larry Liou with JPMorgan.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, Larry.", "Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just touch quickly on how you plan to address the ratings pressure at Moody's?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I'll let Scott talk about \u2013 and I think Larry's question is about the recent action that Moody's took and whether we have any actions that we would plan in response to that. Is that fair, Larry?", "Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes. Exactly.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "So, just to remind everyone, Moody's at our Wisconsin utilities moved them down one notch from A1 to A2 and they described several reasons and one of them is the recovery of some of the regulatory items and not having riders compared to other jurisdictions. With that, now they've put our holding company on a negative watch or outlook also. We're continuing to monitor our holding company debt to total debt, and that's one of the items I think they'd like to see that come back a little faster than we've reduced it. However, as we continue to find good investments such as the Bluewater investment, that will add some stress to the holding company, but it's good for the customers and good for the shareholders as it continues to improve earnings. So we're monitoring that holding company debt and as you can tell, watching our financials as tight as possible.", "Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And I guess just on Bluewater, can you just remind us how you financed the acquisition again?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. So, the way it'll be financed, Larry, initially of course, we'd just take down commercial paper at the holding company to fund the $230 million acquisition price. $115 million or roughly half of the investment down at the sub will be equity and then another $115 million will be non-recourse debt, meaning non-recourse to the holding company debt down at the Bluewater Holding level.", "And then so we'll take $115 million from that financing and pay down some holding company debt. But the holding company is essentially funding its equity contribution, if you will, into the subsidiary with debt up at the holding company.", "Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hello, Shar.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Hey, everyone. Hey, Allen and Scott. How are you?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Just one question, with the Bluewater acquisition, you're kind of sort of chipping away at some incremental growth opportunities that can help you maybe get you above the bottom end of your range. Is there sort of any updates on additional growth opportunities you're kind of working on, maybe the Arizona opportunities or additional storage assets, anything that could help get you above?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. Thanks for the question. And I guess we \u2013 in the November, actually early November timeframe, probably around the EEI Finance Conference, we'd provide a complete update on our five-year capital plan. So, I don't have any incremental update today. But what I would say is I'm feeling very optimistic about additional opportunities. Some of those kind of in the areas that you were alluding to in your question, in the midstream natural gas assets where we would purchase assets that we could either financially or physically integrate with our natural gas distribution company. So, feel optimistic, but what I'd rather do is really provide a complete update and a five-year plan in early November.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "That's super-helpful. Just for \u2013 I think we've talked about sensitivity purposes. Roughly what is it, the capital program, around $1.5 billion over a five-year period could equate to about 1% incremental growth?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. Yes. Just to be clear. So, if you look over a five-year plan and you invest $1.6 billion of capital and let's assume that that's levered 50/50, so, 50% equity, 50% debt and then you earn approximately a 10% return on the equity piece. You're exactly right, that would add 1 percentage point to the five-year compound annual growth in EPS.", "Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Terrific. Good results, guys. Thanks.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hello, Paul.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good afternoon. How are you?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Just did you book any FERC ROE complaint, reserves, or refunds in this quarter?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "No, it was \u2013 the entry we talked about in the prepared comments was in 2016.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And did you quantify that?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "So, this \u2013 I don't know the exact dollar amount. It had to be around $8 million, I'm assuming, $8 million to $9 million.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Pre-tax?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Pre-tax.", "Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Hello, Paul.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Hey, how are you doing?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I'm good. How are you?", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "I'm managing. I just wanted to sort of follow up on Paul Ridzon's question there. The ROE, just if you could break it down for me. It seems like the FERC transmission impact seems a lot more this quarter than last quarter. If you could just walk me through why it's so much more?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. I mean, it's a good question. Last year in the second quarter, the ALJ came out with their decision to, for their second case, to have the FERC ROE was at \u2013 for the second case at 10.2%. Now remember that's 9.7% plus a 50 basis point adder to 10.2%. And that time, then we looked at the complaint period and took an entry in that quarter to record that reserve to that 10.2%.", "Since then, in September of last year, the FERC came out with their decision in the first case that was at a 10.82% ROE, which is a 10.32%, plus a 50 basis point adder to the 10.82%. And since the end of September, we've been booking at that 10.82% until we'll hear on that second complaint. And the second complaint, we're waiting for a quorum now at FERC. We don't know what they'll be in the second half of the year, but currently, we're booking at the 10.82%.", "So, the main driver, the swing between quarters there was the entry last year to get down to the first reserve needed. And it may be a little bit higher too because we're booking at a 10.82%. But long-term in our financial plan, we talk about a 10.2% long-term outlook for the FERC ROE.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. And then, in terms of the lower O&M. I was just wondering if you could break it out a little bit more in Illinois. I apologize if I just missed this, but between that and the continued SMP, and just where the other O&M savings are showing up?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "All right. Well, I think \u2013 let me let Scott maybe give you some color on Illinois, Paul. But maybe just to kind of reground everybody on our O&M plan for the year. So, the goal at an enterprise level was to reduce O&M 3% in 2017 as compared to the actual run rate of O&M \u2013 controlled O&M in 2016. And as I look at the Wisconsin utilities for the year, we've got some timing of O&M expenditures that were moved around because we had to respond to the warmer than normal weather in the first quarter. There's also going to be some downstream O&M effects of the storms that we had that affected the electric business in Wisconsin in the second quarter.", "But overall, my expectation is that those Wisconsin utilities will be right on top of that 3%. But in Illinois, we're actually doing better than plan on O&M. So, Scott, do you want to give Paul some additional color on that?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. So, Illinois, the drivers \u2013 it's a combination of, like you said, the O&M and the rider. I would say probably about $8 million to $10 million of that variance year-to-date is related to the QIP rider, the capital investment, plus some other riders that are just a pass-through of O&M. But O&M is the major driver in there. And that's the majority of the remaining of it, I'd say $10 million to $15 million, plus some other lower interest expenses.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Great. And then just back to the settlement, it seems that when you read the staff, it seems to be saying sort of two different things. On the one hand, it seems to be saying what you just mentioned, which was that they would calculate \u2013 they think it's likely that there'll be a revenue deficiency. But I guess they also start talking about the ROE and how that could maybe change a few things if that was changed. And then they also discussed the concern that they apparently have about rate increases in the future because of the deferrals. And based on what I'm hearing from what you're saying, it looks like \u2013 unless the Commission is okay with these deferrals growing that you probably have to go in for a rate case. Is that right?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, let's just make sure that we're clear on the financial effect that our proposal would have. Our proposal if it were the settlement \u2013 okay, just to be \u2013 so the settlement that we entered into with our customers, if that were implemented, if you look at the projected balances, if you look at where we expect to be at the end of 2017 and look at where we would expect those balances to be at the end of 2019 if they adopted the settlement. I mean if you look end to end, Paul, we would expect there to be no growth on a net basis in those deferred balances. So we'd sort of de-level 2019 year-end versus 2017 year-end, so we wouldn't have any additional accumulation of balances and the hope that we have is that with tax reform that then you will start having some uplift, if you will, or a cost reduction effectively that you could use to start managing those balances down. But if you look at during the pendency of the rate freeze period that we proposed in the settlement, there wouldn't be any net growth at all in those balances.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "So, when the Commission Staff says that their analysis suggests that the approach that you guys are proposing could result in a new deferred balance, if you were to put that new deferred balance with respect to the legacy deferred balances, for lack of a better term, you'd still basically be net no change in the deferred balance at 2019, is that correct?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Right, out to 2019, that's correct.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I mean, we do have some deferred balances that relates to deferred taxes. But once again, we won't collect that from the customers. We'll collect that when we pay it back to the government which will be approximately a 50-year period on these taxes.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "And is that what the Commission's referring to with respect to the staff referring to when they talk about the results of a new deferred \u2013 any new deferred balance?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I think that's what they're referring to is the tax deferred balance.", "Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC", "Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, Dan.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Hi, good afternoon. So, first I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the earlier discussion around the Moody's downgrade. Just wondering, so do you have, say, a ratings target or a leverage target for your balance sheet at both the pairing in at the utilities at a point where you manage towards or the \u2013 a lot level you would defend the rating?", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. When we look at our utilities, we want to keep all the utilities in that single-A rated category. So, they moved a little bit within the category with Moody's now and we did try to defend it to keep it up to that level because we know the cheaper interest is always good for our customers. So, we want to keep in that single-A rated category.", "At the holding company, right now it's on a negative watch. It potentially could move down a little bit and we're going to continue to monitor that. If it does move down a notch, I mean that's where we'll really continue to look at our holding company debt and manage that.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes, I think one of the focuses, Dan, that we've had for quite a while is managing the percentage that holding company debt represents as a proportion of consolidated debt. And so, we've certainly taken a number of actions this year to keep that within the balance that we like it to be. We did permanent non-recourse financings at Michigan Gas Utilities as well as MERC over in Minnesota at the gas utility there.", "And I mentioned the financing that we would plan later this year at Bluewater. So I think all of those has been and will be helpful, and also managing that holding company debt to consolidated debt percentage within a reasonable range.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. Then I also was wondering on page 7 where you show the comparisons from this year to last year. You also had a $4.6 million difference in the corporate and other category. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on what was driving that change.", "Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. There's a lot of little variety of items in that segment there. Just one item and this is kind of inside baseball. But we had some investments that were at the service company that really belong more at the utilities. So, we put the investments in the utilities versus the service company. Their earnings stayed the same, their capital stayed the same, it's just once again, it took \u2013 just moved it into the utility where it belongs. Some of those were still there last year at the acquisition. It's just kind of the cleanup of what we think is the best way to run the service company. So, just a variety of little items.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. And then the last question I had is, there's been some speculation and later today, there'll be an announcement of a large Foxconn facility in Southeastern Wisconsin. And I don't want you to spill the beans or steal the thunder there, but there's been talk about a site where there was an old Chrysler engine plant or whatever. I just wondered if you could confirm whether that site is in your service territory.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Yes. The site that I believe you're referencing is in our service territory, unless they are (36:50) service territory that the electric service territory for Wisconsin Electric. And I'm sure, Dan, we've both read some of the same reports in the press. Certainly Governor Walker has been in detailed discussions with the senior people at Foxconn. Foxconn has indicated that they'll be making a decision soon. But at this point, they haven't made a formal announcement. But what I would say, Dan, the investment that's being discussed would be quite significant for the economy here in Wisconsin.", "Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board", "Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Dan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Zuho (37:48) with Avon Capital Advisors.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Good afternoon, Joe (37:50).", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Hey, it's actually Andrew Levi. How are you doing? Or Andy Levi.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "I'm good, Andy, how are you? An unexpected pleasure.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Yes, I did. Okay, real quick, because I know everybody wants to get off the call. I'm probably the last question. So, just to understand, you were very clear on the settlement, it's all or nothing. But I had this one question on that. Have you spoken to the people or the other organizations that are in the settlement with you? Are they on the same page there or is there a little bit of wiggle room between you and the settlement parties and the Commission?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "We have had, Andy. From time to time, we've had discussions, sort of updates, if you will, with the other parties to the settlement. And they really have the same view that I have. This is a settlement that \u2013 it was highly negotiated between the folks in the settlement and it's not severable. I mean, they view it as a package and we view it as a package, Andy.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Okay. So, it really is all or nothing?", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, we have a package that we and our customers think they're in the best interest of all the customers. So, I mean, I think it's \u2013 as constructed, it's a very, very good package. So, I would be hopeful that the Commissioners would agree with my assessment of it.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "Okay. That's it. Thanks.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Thank you, Andy.", "Andrew Levi - Avon Capital/Millennium", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time.", "Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.", "Well, that concludes our conference call today. Thank you for participating. If you have more questions, please contact Beth Straka.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in listen-only mode at this time.", "Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.", "In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.", "After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.", "And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Mr. Klappa, the floor is yours.", "Gale Klappa", "Leverett Allen is in good physical condition and he continues to make progress in his recovery and rehabilitation work. Among other activities, Allen is engaged in extensive speech therapy at a leading stroke rehabilitation center. No specific time table has been established for his return to the Company, so as we announced a few months ago, I've agreed to serve as Chief Executive for as long as necessary. And on behalf of Allen and his family, I want to thank you again for your well wishes and all your support.", "Now, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations; and the newest member of our senior team, Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary.", "As many of you know, Peggy is stepping into the shoes of Susan Martin. Susan served the Company with real distinction for the past 18 years and should be retiring at the end of the first quarter, and we certainly wish her well. Peggy joined us last year from Modine Manufacturing where she was General Counsel and Corporate Secretary. Her deep business background, her experience as a General Counsel at a public company, make her a perfect fit for our team, so Peggy welcome aboard.", "Peggy Kelsey", "Thank you.", "Gale Klappa", "You are welcome. Now, I'll just start from our news release this morning. We reported full year 2017 adjusted earnings of $3.14 a share. The colder than normal temperatures particularly between Christmas and New Year added $0.02 a share and drove us above the top end of our guidance range.", "I'll also point out that our reported earnings of $3.14 a share exclude a one-time non-cash gain of $0.65 a share from the tax reform law that was signed in December. This one-time, non-cash gain reflects the application of the new tax law for the Company's non-utility assets and to the assets of the parent company. We'll touch on the full impact of the tax reform in more detail in just a few minutes.", "Now, as we review the year just passed, I am pleased to report that our company performed at a high level on virtually every meaningful measure from network reliability to customer satisfaction to community involvement. We delivered record financial results. Our largest utility WE Energies was named the most reliable utility in America and the best in the Midwest for the seventh year running.", "We made significant progress upgrading the natural gas infrastructure in Chicago. And after reviewing our environmental, social and governance practices, Corporate Responsibility Magazine named us one of the 50 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States.", "In addition, our track record of reliability and competitive rates was a factor in the decision by Foxconn Technology Group to invest $10 billion in a high tech manufacturing campus here in Wisconsin. This is one of the largest economic development projects in American history. We expect Foxconn to employ 13,000 people, as they create a brand new industry here in the United States and right here in Southeastern Wisconsin. So, all in all it was a year of solid performance for our company.", "Next, I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investment plan going forward. You'll recall that on August 10th, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8th. Under the approved settlement base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for four consecutive years and essentially gives us our customers' price certainty through 2019.", "The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place were extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism is in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. And just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return then anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely the customers. As part of the agreement, we\u2019ve also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs.", "Now, the commission order that approve the settlement contemplated the potential impact of tax reform. The order suggested that the benefits from a lower tax rate, we use to reduce a regulatory asset balances particularly those for uncollected transmission cost. We expect to file a formal plan with several options for the Wisconsin commission to consider in early February.", "And now an update on Illinois, we continue to make real progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization plan. And on January 10th, the Illinois Commerce Commission issued a final order that supports continuing the program at the same scope, pace and investment level that we proposed. As a reminder, this program is literally critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network as modern, safe and reliable.", "For many years to come, we will need to replace outdated natural gas piping, some of which was installed more than a century ago and is rusting with state-of-the-art materials. In addition, we\u2019re working with the Illinois commission on a plan to flow savings from the new federal tax law back to customers in Chicago.", "Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13th, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to raise natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. On November 21st of last year, the commission approved that interim rate increase at $9.5 million or 3.8%. These self implemented rates became effective on the first day of this year. And the final decision on new rates in Minnesota is expected by the end of calendar 2018. As part of the rate case, we will work with commission to factor in the impact of tax reform.", "Next, I would like to discuss our Michigan utilities, and as a reminder, we obtained final regulatory approval on October 25, for the construction of new natural gas fire generation in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Site preparation begins within days of the commission order. Our plan is to bring the new facilities in the commercial service by mid 2019 and at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle.", "The project calls for a $266 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines, we call these RICE units. They will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for customers in the Upper Peninsula including the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland Cliffs.", "On tax reform for our Michigan utilities, we submitted a filing on January 19th estimating the impacts of the reductions in tax rates. We're proposing to defer the effects of tax reform in Michigan and factor the balances into our next rate case. So in summary looking ahead through 2018, it should be a relatively quite year from a regulatory standpoint. We have a base rate freeze in place in Wisconsin, and beyond the outstanding rate case in Minnesota, we don\u2019t plan to file a traditional rate case in any of our jurisdictions.", "Turning now to our five-year capital spending plan, our updated five year plan, you recall we rolled that out in November totals $11.8 billion, an increase of $2.1 billion over the previous five year plan. I would note that this does not include our share of the projected capital investments at American Transmission Company. Our updated capital plan is focused on reshaping our generation fleet for a clean reliable future. Our approach calls for greater reliance on natural gas and solar energy to meet customer demand for electricity.", "In addition to the 180 megawatts of RICE generation that we talked about in Michigan, we plan to add another 50 megawatts of RICE generation in Northern Wisconsin in the Wisconsin Public Service territory by 2021. We also have the option as you recall to invest up to $200 million in the Riverside power plant that's a natural gas fired facility being built by Alliant. And importantly, we plan to expand our renewable generation portfolio.", "Over the past five years, utility scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices, prices have dropped by approximately 70%, making solar a cost effective option for our customers and option that also fits very well with our summer demand curve. Utility scale solar will not only better balance our energy supply with customer demand but will also help reduce our power supply costs and our CO2 emissions. We're currently in discussions with developers and we plan to file for approvals with the Wisconsin Commission this spring.", "Finally, you'll recall that our Wisconsin Public Service Utility along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Medicine Gas and Electric have agreed to purchase the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. On January 16th of this year, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission approved the sale. We are now awaiting Wisconsin Commission final approval. Our customers will see real savings because the purchase of the wind farm will eliminate the existing power purchase agreement. We expect to close on the transaction sometime in the first half of this year.", "And finally, a word about our dividend policy, at this January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $55.25 per share. That's an increase of 6.25% over the previous rate. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.21 per share, and folks this will mark the 15th consecutive year that our company will reward our shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're at the middle of that range now, so I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.", "And now with details on our 2017 results and our outlook for sparkling 2018, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott?", "Scott Lauber", "Thank you, Gale. Our 2017 GAAP earnings were $3.79 per share compared to $2.96 per share in 2016. The 2017 results include earnings from recurring operations of $3.14 per share and the net impact of one-time non-cash adjustments totaling $0.65 per share.", "As Gale mentioned, these one-time adjustments reflect the application of the new tax law to the Company's non-utility assets and to the assets of the parent company. Excluding the deferred tax benefit, our 2017 adjusted earnings were $3.14 per share. This is an increase of $0.17 over our 2016 adjusted earnings of $2.97 per share. As a reminder, our 2016 adjusted earnings excluded $0.01 of acquisition costs.", "For the rest of my presentation, I'll refer exclusively to adjusted earnings. Our favorable results were largely driven by effective cost control and additional capital investment. This was partially offset by lower electric sales volume resulting from significant cooler summer weather compared to the summer of 2016. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the comparison of fourth quarter and full year 2017 and 2016 results, both GAAP and adjusted.", "For 2017 results, I'll first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 12 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2017 was $1.785 billion as compared to adjusted operating income of $1.686 billion in 2016, an increase of nearly a $100 million.", "Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1.066 billion for 2017, an increase of $39 million from 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expenses were significantly lower. This was partially offset by a lower sales margin closely attributed to the cool summer weather in 2017.", "Our Illinois segment recorded operating income of $273 million an increase of $33.4 million compared to 2016. This increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system monetization program and lower operations and maintenance expense. Our Other States segments recognized operating income of $54.2 million, an increase of $4.3 million compared to 2016. This also was primarily driven by lower operating and maintenance expense.", "Turning to Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure segment, operating income at this segment was up $24.9 million, remember that this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holdings which was acquired on June 30th, as well as the result of We Power. Operating income from our Power the Future plans increased $16.5 million, reflecting additional investments. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $8.4 million to operating income in 2017.", "The adjusted operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased by $1.9 million year-over-year, taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at nearly a $100 million increase in adjusted operating income. Earnings from our investment in American Transition Company totaled a $154.3 million, an increase of $7.8 million over the last year.", "In 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of administrative law judge recommendation related to return on equity reviews being conducted by FERC. Our other income net decreased by $16.2 million year-over-year. Recall that we recorded a gain in 2016 related to the repurchase of certain Integrys notes at a discount as well as a gain on the sale of Wisvest. These items were partially offset by higher gains and investments that we recognized in 2017.", "Our net interest expense increased $13 million year-over-year primarily driven by higher debt levels resulting from continued capital investments. The increase in pre-tax earnings year-over-year drove the $22.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. The adjusted effective tax rate decreased slightly from 37.6% in 2016 to 37.2% in 2017.", "Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 22% and 23%. We're still evaluating the full implication of tax reform and as always, we will continue to update you on the changes during our next call. With the latest tax law changes, we do expect to be a cash tax payer by the end of 2018. Combining all these items bring us to adjusted earnings of $997 million or $3.14 per share for 2017 compared to adjusted earnings of $941 million or $2.97 per share for 2016.", "Looking at the cash flow statement at Page 8 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $23.9 million during 2017 compared to 2016. This decrease was driven by $100 million contribution to our pension plan in January 2017, partially offset by the year-over-year increase in operating income. Our capital expenditures were approximately $2 billion for 2017, a $536 million increase for 2016 reflecting our continued investment in our core infrastructure.", "Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 52.5% at the end of 2017 and increase from 51.9% adjusted debt to capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Some of you have recently asked how tax reform will affect the cash flow and credit matrix. We now expect our FFO to debt metric to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We also paid $657 million in common dividends during the 2017, an increase of $31.6 million over 2016 reflecting the dividend increase last year.", "Turning now to sales, we continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2017, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 20,000 more natural gas customers than they did a year ago. Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 15 and 16 of the earnings package, weather-normalized sales factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, retail deliveries of our electricity for our Michigan utilities excluding the Iron ore mine were down 1.6% and as weather-normalized basis decrease four tone of 1%.", "Turning to natural gas deliveries, as you may recall our Illinois segment is largely decoupled and its margins are less affected by weather. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin excluding gas use for power generation were up 4.3%. On weather-normalized basis and excluding gas use for generation natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 3.7% and we're above our expectations.", "And now I will briefly touch on our 2018 sales forecast for the state of Wisconsin our largest segment. We're forecasting a slight decrease one tenths of one percent in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine. We project Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for generation to increase by three tenths of one percent.", "At this time, I'd like to discuss our earnings guidance for 2018. As you know, we expect long term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7% of a base of $3.09 per share. This was the midpoint of our 2017 guidance. So, looking ahead, our guidance for 2018 is in the range of $3.26 per share to $3.30 per share. This is in line with our longer term growth expectations. Our guidance assumes normal weather and the estimated impact of tax reform.", "Finally, let's look at the first quarter of 2018 guidance. In the first quarter of last year, we earned $1.12 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2017 had warmer than normal weather which is offset by effective cost control. Taking these factors into account, we project first quarter 2018 earnings to be in the range of $1.14 per share to a $1.16 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.14 per share to $1.16 per share.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.", "Gale Klappa", "Thank you, Scott, very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And Sarah, I think we're now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our conference call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "All right. Thank you. At this time, we'll take your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore.", "Greg Gordon", "Good outlook, do you think we're going to get Kirk Cousins over in Jet land?", "Gale Klappa", "I am betting on that and it's interesting without Aaron Rodgers, the Packers look like the Jets, Greg.", "Greg Gordon", "Fair enough, fair enough, I think rather have them the Packers even without Aaron and Jets spring. But let me ask you a question on in terms of the impact of tax reform, can you refresh our memories on the rate deal that you have in Wisconsin? My understanding if my memory serves me correctly. Is that you have a regulatory asset associated with the transmission investment that hasn't been rolled into rates, but the tax reform is going to allow you to work down that balance is that correct?", "Gale Klappa", "Greg, you've got a good memory. Actually and this was I think a very positive forward looking approach in the rate settlement, both by the interveners, the commission staff, the commissioners and our company. And it is not a mandated order, but when you look at the wording in the order that approved the rate settlement. It strongly suggests that the benefits of tax reform that we file a plan to apply, some or all of the benefits of tax reform to working down this regulatory asset balance that sits on our balance sheet. And that regulatory asset balance is largely for as you pointed out, transmission costs that we've incurred but we've not yet rolled in the rates, that's a pretty sizeable asset balance roughly about 400 million, if I am correct.", "Scott Lauber", "The transmission is just a little over 200 million.", "Gale Klappa", "Just over 200, okay, so it's pretty sizeable. So, we'll file a plan on February 9th and obviously the follow-through on that -- on that strong suggestion in the rate order that we -- what we used the benefits of tax reform to basically pay down that credit card IOU. So, that's a very positive thing I think, a very forward looking thing that was part of the rate settlement. So to kind of answer your question more broadly, there're kind of three big moving pieces here when we try to estimate the overall impact or the bottom line impact of tax reform.", "First is, assuming we begin to pay down that asset balance for transmission. The second is, as you know the value of interest deduction is lower with the lower tax rate, so there is a drag at the holding company on holding company interest. And then the third is, the elimination of bonus depreciation effective January of 18th which will add to rate base. So, you kind of put all those three in the blender and our best estimate right now is about a $0.05 to $0.06 drag, on overall earnings per share as the net impact of tax reform.", "Greg Gordon", "But that's baked into your guidance for 2018 and your confidence in your growth rate. So you factor that in to\u2026", "Gale Klappa", "That is correct. And you know, we're very good at looking ahead and planning, so the idea that there would be some potential drag from tax reform is something that our team's been looking at really since about midyear 2017. So, this wasn't a surprise to us. We were planning to steps that we needed to take to overcome the $0.05 or $0.06 drag, and you're correct, we're still on the 5 to 7% growth track with the guidance that Scott just gave you.", "Greg Gordon", "Last question, if this -- does your capital expenditure budget fully contemplate the capital needs that go along with this Foxconn construction project in terms of all the demand pool and infrastructure that might be required? Or are we going to be looking for an update once you have a full sense of the scope there?", "Gale Klappa", "I think we have tried to factor in as best we know on the electric side. So in terms of electric, Wisconsin Electric Capital, expenditures I think we've done a good job of rolling that in. But as we work now and extensively every week actually with the technical people who are going to be responsible for constructing that huge campus, 23 million square foot campus, I think we and they are beginning to realize that there may be some additional and it could be substantial some additional demand for natural gas capacity that may require some fair amount of capital to make sure we're properly serving their natural gas needs. So, the answer's kind of mixed, yes, I think we've cranked in the electric demand and the capital associated with that. But I think there's going to be some upside on the natural gas capital, and Greg I would expect, we'll start seeing the demand from Foxconn start to really ramp up in 2020, 2021 and certainly 2022.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.", "Michael Weinstein", "Since you know, you said that the $0.05 to $0.06 is fully inclusive it's like net all effects. Is that included things like the reduction of deferred tax liabilities, We Power, the amortization overtime? And also, are you expecting to hit the 50 bps threshold at Wisconsin Electric because rate being under the rate freeze?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, first question first. I guess the best way to answer your question about tax reform to the best of our knowledge it's like Ragu, it's all in there.", "Michael Weinstein", "Do you include any sharing from\u2026", "Gale Klappa", "Our current plan has each as we always have added the good success in doing. Our current plan assumes that each one of our operating units actually earned their allowed rate of return. So, this particular we would not -- we're budgeting for sharing.", "Michael Weinstein", "Does that mean you don\u2019t anticipate happening or is just not budgeted?", "Gale Klappa", "That means at the moment we do not anticipate it happening.", "Michael Weinstein", "What happens to FFO to debt, after the rate free ends in 2019? How long does that regulatory asset amortization continue? And how long does it prop up before the debt?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, right now that will have to be decided in the -- assuming there is a rate case in 2019 in Wisconsin Scott that would have to be decided in that case.", "Scott Lauber", "In that case for effective 2020, but right now we look at our five year plan, we\u2019re in that 16 to 18 range. Prior to tax reform, we have 16 to 19 that's kind of took us off the top of the end of range, but we're comfortable in that 16 to 18 range.", "Michael Weinstein", "So even after perhaps some of the effects of tax reform enrolled into customer rates at some points, you\u2019re thinking 16 to 18 kind of number to the, at least in this five years.", "Gale Klappa", "Correct.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Nick Campanella with Bank of America.", "Nick Campanella", "I just want to go to the 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt. Is that something that the agencies are comfortable with? Just know given Moody's has been in pretty vocal about this for the broader utility group, have you guys said whether you will be willing to defend your ratings? Or how should we kind think about that as we get pass 2019?", "Gale Klappa", "Let me say this and I'm going to ask Scott to give you his technical view on what Moody's are saying. But first of all, we work very hard to have one of the best balance sheets in the industry. So, we\u2019re cognizant of the fact that we want our metrics to merit -- to merit, the kind of ratings we're getting right now. But have been said that, you will notice that in Scott's comments, it's been consistent with what we said along we do not have any plans issue any additional equity.", "We think we\u2019re going to be able to stay in the kind of 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt as Scott has mentioned, certainly we're not issuing any additional equity. And one of the other things that I think is important historically the Wisconsin Commission which is still where we have the largest percentage of our assets has always been very vigilant and very cognizant of the fact that they want strong credit quality utilities. So, I think you put all that together and we believe we have the capability again without issuing any additional equity to stay in the range. Scott?", "Scott Lauber", "That\u2019s correct, that 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt range basically Moody's at the holding company has us on a negative outlook, which that negative outlook puts us at a rating in that 16% to 18%. I feel very comfortable that we'll maintain that rating then. And like Gale said, no equity issuance needed in the plan.", "Nick Campanella", "And then just moving something else on the wind PPA, where you're replacing this with an ownership option. Are there other situations across your jurisdictions where we could be looking towards similar strategy, anything that we should pay attention to do there?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, I would say not necessarily in 2018, but watch the space.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Leslie Rich with JPMorgan.", "Leslie Rich", "I had a question on your utility scale solar investment. Just wondering, how much you're thinking you might allocate towards that in terms of CapEx, and if that's part of your five year plan or that would be incremental?", "Gale Klappa", "It is part of the five year plan and we're looking at the specifics right now. We're tentatively -- again we have -- we're still talking with developers. But if I were to venture a guess, I think it would be too pretty sizeable size, perhaps one in the Wisconsin Public Service area in Northern Wisconsin. But again, we're looking right now and talking with a number of developers. And Scott, it is in our five year plan.", "Scott Lauber", "Yes, it's in our five year plan, and it's really in the couple of segments. Early on, I would say about 300 million to 400 million in the first few years, and then we have about 350 million in the later part of the five year plan.", "Gale Klappa", "And Leslie, we expect to make some final decisions and file for a construction authority approval with the Wisconsin Commission this spring.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.", "Paul Ridzon", "Just a question on tax reform at the unregulated businesses, I assume, We Power just flows through to a predetermined ROE, but what happens at Bluewater and ATC?", "Gale Klappa", "Scott?", "Scott Lauber", "So, at Bluewater, that was contemplated in the affiliate interest agreements with the three Wisconsin utility. So that would get pass through the affiliate interest agreement and get passed through to our customers through their purchase gas adjustment clause. So that will get factored in and then customers will receive the benefit. At ATC of course they're formula rates there and those formula rates will get passed through then to our utilities. As a reminder that also would help the escrow balance at our utilities, at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service.", "Gale Klappa", "So the thought would be that the change in tax rates that benefits ATC would flow through and we would use that to reduce the asset balance for uncollected transmission cost.", "Scott Lauber", "Correct.", "Paul Ridzon", "In Wisconsin that's dollar for dollar, so there's no really earnings impact there?", "Gale Klappa", "Correct. That is correct.", "Paul Ridzon", "And then in Michigan, just some clarification, we've over earned in Michigan because you're saving that -- those taxes for later. Are you going to hang up the regulatory liabilities for those?", "Gale Klappa", "No, we would hang it up on our balance sheet and track it. And then factor it into the next rate case. That is what we filed. I will see what the Michigan Commission responds with.", "Paul Ridzon", "And who you're looking for Gale? Don't they pay you, any other answer will work.", "Gale Klappa", "A sentimental thing, Doug Pederson, the Head Coach of Eagles used to be the quarterbacks coach when Brett Favre was Green Bay. So there is a sentimental attachment there where Brady's have to be.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your last question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lapides", "Real quickly, first of all gas demand and I may have misheard, but it seems like you're putting a pretty conservative number in 2018 guidance for weather-normalized gas demand especially and if you can -- you or Scott can remind us, the levels of weather-normalized gas demand that you've realized over the last few years?", "Scott Lauber", "Well, certainly last year, 2017 our weather-normalized demand growth with natural gas, this is at retail now excluding power generation was up more than 3%. That's a surprisingly good number and the economy is strong but not knowing how sustainable that is and Scott I actually talked in this morning, our customer growth has been about 1% on the natural gas side.", "So you know, not knowing how sustainable that kind of 3 percentage kind of growth is we've achieved, three-tenths of 1%. Michael you're correct it\u2019s been about 3% the last couple of years and we think that's related to conversions and the stability of natural gas prices we've also seen some industrial customers convert to natural gas.", "I just don't think those conversions once they convert, I don't know if they'll continue and every time and plant gets replaced, it\u2019s more efficient. Just to put it in perspective though about a 1% increase in natural gas demand adds about a $0.05 or about $3 million to earnings. So, it's not, you know it's very nice. So, if we get a little more growth that'll be all positive, but it's not extremely large number.", "Gale Klappa", "And Michael, as we get closer to 2020, 2021 you'll probably see us revive our gas demand because of what we expect to be pretty sizeable demand from Foxconn.", "Michael Lapides", "Right, understood, one other question, you've got a bit of build for short term debt balance at the end of the year. We've seen rate move and how are you thinking about we are hedging whether we are terming out some of that short term debt or other actions you can take to potentially you know head off at the past what could be a very, a minor EPS headwind just from simply higher rates?", "Gale Klappa", "Well couple of things and first of all, we do have a pretty robust financing plan for 2018 and there may be some opportunities there that we're certainly looking at. However, in our budget in our guidance and in our forecast, we have assumed in terms of short term interest rates, we've assumed four out of four quarter point increases from the Fed, one every quarter in 2018. And I think that's a reasonable assumption. So basically, we've got a very, I think a very appropriate interest rate forecast baked into our guidance, and then there maybe some opportunity with our financings over the course of the year to do better.", "Michael Lapides", "Got it, last thing in your estimates for ATC your transmission earnings. Can you remind us, what ROE, are you booking for GAAP income statement purposes?", "Gale Klappa", "Well, on our longer term estimate, because we expect that allowed ROE from FREC will come down. Our longer term projection is 10:2 and Scott we\u2019re booking a little better than that right now.", "Scott Lauber", "Right now, we\u2019re currently booking 10.82, which is based on the first decision for this first case decision. We're assuming that gives results sometime in the middle of this year, but long-term we do have that 10.2 factored into our forecast.", "Michael Lapides", "So in other words, the ATC earnings power for at least half of this year. Has an elevated ROE that you, when you think about your multiyear growth rate, you don\u2019t use when you kind think about 2019 and beyond?", "Gale Klappa", "Correct, you got it, you nailed it. And I will say this, everybody speculating about the new members of FERC and the methodology they might use to set is on a reasonable this. I personally and I could be wrong, but I personally do not see the FERC lowering transmission ROEs below state ROEs. Just be countered everything that FERC is trying to accomplish. So, we feel very comfortable with the 10.2.", "Gale Klappa", "All right. Well, folks, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for taking part.
