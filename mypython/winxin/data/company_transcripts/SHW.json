Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions. ", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Jesse. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck describing our new reportable segment on our website sherwin.com, under Investor Relations July 20 press release.", "I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2017 compared to second quarter 2016 then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 16% or $516.3 million to $3.74 billion due primarily to the Valspar sales in June and higher paint sales volume in the Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group. The change in revenue classification increased consolidated sales 2.2% in the quarter.", "Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $101.2 million or 6.2% to $1.74 billion in the quarter. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 430 basis points in the quarter to 46.5% of sales from 50.8% in the second quarter last year.", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 9.3% or $97 million over the second quarter last year to $1.15 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 190 basis points to 30.7% in the second quarter this year from 32.6% last year.", "Amortization increased to $28.9 million from $5.6 million last year due entirely to the increase in intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition. Interest expense increased $15.8 million compared to second quarter last year to $56.7 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $30.2 million or 5.6% to $509 million.", "Our effective tax rate in the second quarter on income from continuing operations was 29.1%. For the full year 2017, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the high 20% range. Consolidated net income decreased $59 million or 15.6% to $319.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 8.5% compared to 11.7% in the second quarter last year.", "Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased 15.8% to $3.36 per share from $3.99 per share in 2016. The $3.36 includes a $0.44 charge related to the Valspar industrial wood finishes divestiture and a $0.92 dilution from acquisition-related expenses, including a step-up in inventory and depreciation and amortization.", "We have summarized the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our second quarter 2017 press release.", "Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for the Americas Group in the second quarter 2017 increased $196 million or 8.7% to $2.43 billion from $2.24 billion last year. The sales increase was primarily due to higher organic paint sales volumes across most end markets, the impact of the revenue reclassification and selling price increases.", "Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 4.9%. The change in the revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales.", "Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Eastern division and Canada division. Sales and volumes were positive in every operating division.", "Segment profit for the group increased $33.3 million or 6.7% to $532.7 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint sales volumes and selling price increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs and continued challenges in the Latin America region.", "Segment operating margin decreased to 21.8% of sales from 22.2% in the second quarter last year. If you exclude the change in the revenue classification, segment profit margin in the second quarter increased to 22.6%.", "Turning to the Consumer Brands Group. Second quarter sales increased $74 million or 16% to $536.5 million due primarily to Valspar sales in June, partially offset by lower volume sales to most of the group's retail and commercial customers.", "Segment profit per consumer brand decreased $27.1 million or 26.3% to $76.1 million in the quarter due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization cost totaling $20.5 million and lower sales volumes, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, good expense control, and selling price increases.", "Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 14.2% from 22.3% in the same period last year. Most of the impact in segment profit margin was from acquisition-related expenses and higher raw material costs.", "For our Performance Coatings Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased $246.9 million or 48% to $761.1 million in the quarter due to Valspar sales for the month of June, higher coatings sales volume and selling price increases.", "Stated in U.S. dollars, second quarter segment profit decreased $8 million or 11.4% to $62.3 million due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization cost totaling $38.3 million. As a percent of sales, segment profit decreased to 8.2% from 13.7% in the same period last year.", "I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties, we filed a Notice of Appeal in March of 2014, which was fully briefed by February 2015.", "Last week, the Sixth District Court of Appeals for California scheduled the date for oral argument on the appeal for August 24th of this year. We believe a decision could be rendered by the Appellate Court within 90 days following oral argument.", "That concludes our review of second quarter results for 2017. So, I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. John?", "John Morikis", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. I know the purpose of this call is to review the past three months. However, I think it's only fitting to open my comments this morning with some perspective on our future.", "Sherwin-Williams and Valspar are now one company. As we said before, the combination of these two businesses will clearly differentiate us in the global paints and coatings market.", "It significantly expands our brand portfolio and customer relationships in North America; creates a stronger, more global industrial coatings platform than either companies stand-alone; and extends our capabilities into new applications and geographies, including a scale platform to grow in Asia-Pacific.", "Customers will benefit from our increased product range, enhanced technology and innovation capabilities, streamlined cost structure, and improved productivity. We have tremendous respect for the skill and dedication of the Valspar team and we're excited about the opportunities that this combination will provide to all employees of the new company.", "The integration work is off to a very good start and although there are some obvious challenges to work through, we're genuinely excited about our future. Some of the challenges I'm referring to are apparent in our results for the second quarter and they affected both sales and profitability.", "If you look at our results without Valspar, consolidated sales increased 4.2% over second quarter 2016, with a significant portion of the increase coming from the change in revenue classification.", "Core gross margin declined 140 basis points year-over-year and SG&A as a percent of sales declined 110 basis points. If you adjust for the revenue classification, gross margin declined about 50 basis points and SG&A was down about 60. Adjusted operating margin increased 10 basis points and adjusted profit before tax as a percent of sales improved to a record 17.8% from a comparable 17.5% last year.", "Revenue and volume momentum in our North American paint stores slowed somewhat from the pace said in the first quarter. We often say that a strong week in June can make up for a weak first quarter. The opposite also tends to hold true.", "While sales across all segments showed positive growth in the quarter, the sequential slowdown was almost entirely due to softer DIY sales both in the quarter and flat year-over-year exterior paint volumes in the month of June, primarily due to the volume declines in the last two weeks of the month.", "As a result, exterior paint volumes in the quarter grew at roughly half the rate of interior paint, which is highly abnormal. The combination of weak DIY sales and weak exterior paint volumes negatively affected both revenue growth and mix. DIY is the highest gross margin segment in our stores business and the average selling price of exterior paint is significantly higher than interior.", "On a positive note, sales to residential repaint contractors once again grew at a double-digit pace in the second quarter. Despite the softness in exterior paint, sales to all residential contractors combined, both new and repaint, grew nearly double-digits.", "Exterior paint sales momentum appears to be rebounding in July, and we anticipate normal exterior painting activity over the balance of the season, which should support stronger comp stores volume growth in the months ahead.", "The outlook for continued growth in both residential and commercial markets over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor customers and healthy spray equipment sales in the quarter. Protective & Marine coatings sales also improved compared to second quarter last year, but grew less than our overall comp store growth rate.", "Our business in Latin America was a significant drag on the results of the Americas Group segment. While sales and profitability in the Indian region and Southern Cone countries are showing steady improvement, our largest market in the region, Brazil, continues to struggle.", "Sales through our company-operated stores in Brazil increased mid-single digits in the quarter, while sales through external retailers and distributors averaged double-digit declines.", "Our efforts to mitigate rapidly rising raw material costs, particularly TiO2, with price increases has gained some traction, which should stem some of the erosion in operating margin.", "During the first six months, we opened 27 net new stores and added 50 new sales territories in the U.S. and Canada and added six net new stores in Latin America. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,207 compared to 4,117 a year ago.", "In Latin America, we currently operate 345 stores compared to 302 a year ago. Our plan for the full year still calls for the store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean compared to the 94 last year.", "Consumer Brands Group, ex-Valspar, also posted another very disappointing quarter with declining sales across most product categories and market segments in most geographic regions. This weakness was particularly acute in Europe and in smaller retailer comps in the U.S. and Canada, but sales to all customer segments declined compared to second quarter last year.", "In the U.S. and Canada, many retail customers report slow sales of architectural paint so far this season and many have scaled back inventories as a result. From a margin perspective, most of the operating margin decline was from lower gross margin, which was partly the result of raw material inflation and partly due to absorption loss from lower volumes.", "Performance Coatings Group, excluding the Valspar results, was relatively flat year-over-year on both sales and margins. If you break down sales by geography, the strongest region by a wide margin was Latin America with strong volume growth in automotive finishes, wood coatings, general industrial and Protective & Marine.", "Sales in the U.S. and Canada were relatively flat, and Europe and Asia were down year-over-year. This group has done a commendable job of managing SG&A spending and implementing price increases where necessary to offset raw material inflation. As a result, the group is geared to earn high incremental margins when we get volume growth on a stronger track.", "So, the common theme running through all of our core businesses in the second quarter: not enough volume. Each of these businesses is well managed. Our expenses are in line. We have great pricing discipline and the most productive supply chain operation in the industry. Most of our shortfall in the quarter was related to weak volumes.", "Valspar sales in the month of June were approximately $380 million, an increase of about 12% over June last year. A large portion of the increase resulted from a favorable calendar comparison, which added two shipping days to the month.", "Operating margins for the Valspar paints business, which consists of architectural paint and related products sold in the U.S., Canada, Australia, China and the U.K., held up pretty well early in the year, but faltered in June.", "The coatings business, which includes packaging coatings, coil coatings, industrial wood coatings, general industrial, automotive and protective and marine, saw significant operating margin compression year-over-year. Margin declines in both of these businesses were due primarily to the lag in implementing price increases to offset raw material inflation.", "Given the spike in petrochemical raw materials early in the year, the large customer concentration of this business and the uniqueness of the situation over the past year, this lag is not entirely surprising. This issue is receiving a lot of attention and will take some time to address. But historically, these businesses have been successful at recovering raw material inflation due to the strong customer value propositions.", "In the first six months of 2017, we generated $539 million in net operating cash, an increase of $29 million compared to the first half of 2016, driven by higher six-month net income and lower working capital requirements.", "Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $84 million and we anticipate approximately $240 million in capital expenditures for the full year. Depreciation was $95 million and amortization was $35.1 million.", "Total company borrowings on June 30 were $11.5 billion and our 12-month interest expense is projected to be approximately $400 million. Incremental depreciation and amortization step-up related to the Valspar acquisition is projected to be $275 million on an annual basis. Purchase accounting inventory adjustments of approximately $110 million are being amortized over three months of June through August 2017.", "During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. At the close of the second quarter, our cash balance was $210 million compared to $403 million on June 30th, 2016. This cash will be used to reduce debt. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share, up from $0.84 last year.", "On the first quarter 2017 earnings call, I said our expectations for average year-over-year raw material inflation was in the mid-single-digit and that outlook hasn't changed. As expected, the price volatility in resins, latex, solvents and packaging, caused by an uptick in propylene and tight supply of key monomers early in the year has moderated. Low TiO2 inventories will continue to drive modest inflation in pigments, but not likely to be on the range anticipated in our overall raw material outlook.", "The price increases announced in our core Sherwin-Williams businesses continued to gain traction and we have not made any additional announcements. We will, however, continue to monitor changes in the raw material environment and will respond appropriately to changes as we go through the year. There's also little change in our outlook for paint and coatings demand.", "Domestic architectural paint demand should remain strong throughout the year and worldwide demand for many of our industrial products, including protective and marine coatings, should continue to strengthen. These market factors create a positive backdrop, but our success will rely on accelerating volume growth through market share growth.", "For the third quarter, we anticipate Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase in the low to mid-single-digit percentage compared to last year's third quarter. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $1 billion in the quarter.", "At that anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the third quarter to be in the range of $3.70 to $4.10 per share. This includes a charge of $1.10 per share for costs associated with the Valspar acquisition. It also includes $0.40 to $0.60 per share accretion from Valspar operations, net of acquisition financing expense of $0.40 per share in the third quarter. As a reminder, third quarter 2016 earnings were $4.08 per share and included $0.24 per share charge for acquisition related costs.", "For the full year 2017, we expect Sherwin-Williams' core net sales to increase by mid-single-digit percentage compared to full year 2016. In addition, we expect incremental sales from the Valspar acquisition to be approximately $2.4 billion in 2017. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2017 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.30 to $12.70 per share.", "Full year 2017 diluted net income per common share guidance includes a $2.50 per share charge from costs associated with the acquisition of Valspar and an increase of $0.75 to $0.95 per share from Valspar operations.", "The increase from Valspar operations is net of acquisition finance expense of $0.95 per share for the full year. Full year 2016 earnings per share was $11.99 and included $0.86 per share related to the Valspar acquisition.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen at this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Hi good morning.", "John Morikis", "Good morning.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Hi. In your Consumer Brands business, did the Valspar piece perform differently than the Sherwin piece? And is it reasonable to look at that segment as being down about 12% organically in sales in the quarter?", "John Morikis", "Well, let me take a stab at this Jeff and say that the weakness that we saw first in the quarter -- first quarter to second quarter was pretty broad based. And when you ask about how the performance is performing, there's obviously two components to it; our sales out our door and then to the retail customer themselves.", "So I would say that -- to your question about how they're performing, I'd say out the door, our expectations are they're running in a similar pace from the PoS data that we can see from our customers, although, admittedly, that's limited. But in the door, I would say that our gallons are running shorter or smaller than Valspar's.", "Allen Mistysyn", "And Jeff this is Al. I would add. And part of the reason that is, just the tight inventory control that we're seeing across the channel due to what we believe to be general softness in the DIY market.", "John Morikis", "Yes, I'd say many of our customers in this segment are struggling to grow, and some are going backwards. And as a result they're managing their inventory.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Are average prices in the Consumer Brands Group going up or down or staying flat?", "John Morikis", "Are you talking about our prices, Jeff?", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Well, both your prices and then how you look at it with Valspar when you look at it pro forma year-over-year.", "Allen Mistysyn", "Jeff, I -- we -- I don't think we've historically talked about pricing specific to the Consumer segment. We generally stick to our Paint Stores Group when we talk about, as an example, price increases. So, I just -- with the mix of products in that, I don't think it's appropriate to talk about specific pricing in consumers -- in our consumer segment.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Okay, great. Thank you so much.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Parkinson", "Thank you. While you've been working on Valspar over a year, can you just comment on any initial surprises, either positive or negative, now that you've had almost two months full of the books and just in terms of product marketing, raw material procurement, culture and anything else you may find as an opportunity on a go-forward basis? Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Yes. I would say that we're very pleased. In fact, I'm probably more bullish about Valspar right now than I ever have been. I'll start with the quality of people. We've had the opportunity to spend more time from leadership all the way down to those customers that are closest to our customers. And I have to say that I have a lot of respect going into it. I'm really impressed and very pleased with the quality of people that we see.", "We've not seen anything -- and you mentioned about synergies. We've not seen any in the first 45 days here that had me anything but excited and confident in our ability to deliver on the synergies that we've talked about. And I would say that as we've dialed in more and more into product quality and technology, it just feels like we're finding more upside as we go through that.", "Now the one side I -- one point I will say that, to be completely transparent on the downside, is that I wish they would have been a bit more proactive in their pricing. If you look at the historical performance of Valspar and their ability to demonstrate the value to their customers and move with inflation, they had been very successful. And this is the same team that will be executing these price increases now.", "I wish they would have been a bit more proactive. I can also understand after a year and a half of going through an FTC process that a lot of things get maybe pushed aside. But I'd say that we've got great confidence in the team, the value proposition. These are not commodities, these are terrific value to our customers and I wish they would have been a bit more proactive in that activity.", "Chris Parkinson", "And just a very quick follow-up. You just said on some key trends on pro versus DIY. But just within the pro market, can you just hit on any just broader comments in the performance of your customers across anything from resi and repaint, property management or even commercial? Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Sure, I'd say let's start with residential repaint. As we mentioned, we had a nice quarter. Again, that will be 13 to 15 quarters that we've had double-digit gains in our residential repaint. And as I mentioned, that's with -- what was going to be a terrific quarter. Last couple of weeks in June just crushed our exterior sales. And as I mentioned, those come along with a higher average sale price. So, we're really pleased with the momentum of our stores organization and the momentum that they have in that residential repaint team.", "We've got phenomenal leaders, great products, great service and, most importantly, the right people close to the customers. So, we've got a lot of momentum and a lot of confidence there.", "On the new residential side, we're really pleased with our momentum there as well. We have -- I don't know if I've ever -- we've ever shared this with anyone publicly here, but we've got exclusive agreements with 15 of the top 20 national builders here in the U.S. And yes, and I know the follow-up question, we are working on the additional five. We have that discussion on about a monthly basis. But we've got really good progress there and the value proposition and introducing new products and services to the new residential customers is going well.", "And our commercial base is one where we've just got really good work course systems and our sales organization works very closely with that customer base. So, we're feeling very bullish about the momentum in the architectural business and really thrilled about our position, but not complacent. We're always challenging our team on how we're going to be better and more aligned with our customers in a differentiating way.", "Bob Wells", "Hey, Chris, this is Bob. And just because we're on the subject of painting contractors, let me break in. And because there's been a lot of debate on whether the labor supply issue is improving or staying the same. From our perspective, while it may be approving -- improving marginally in some regions of the country, I think in most of the country, we're still seeing pretty chronic labor supply shortages.", "In the Southeast, Southwest and West in particular, those are the tightest regions and certainly, the impact on project count is pretty significant. Our contractor surveys in every region tell us that contractors would bid more work if they had more help. And most say they'd be willing to pay more to get more qualified labor. So the labor shortages that we've talked about for the last year and a half to two years don't appear to be behind us.", "John Morikis", "And I'd say the fact that they've got labor issues in some of these markets, they lean more on our people and our stores. So, it really fits well to our model.", "Chris Parkinson", "It's great color. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "You bet.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Great. Thanks. Good morning.", "John Morikis", "Good morning Arun.", "Arun Viswanathan", "So, I just had a question on the guidance. So, I guess, just trying to understand the mid-single-digit comment for Q3 and the full year. So, does that kind of -- maybe you can parse that out on your expectations for Paint Stores Group and Consumer where historically, my understanding is that Paint Stores will be at the upper end of that and then Consumer potentially lower. Are you still expecting consumer to lag through the rest of the year and potentially show negative growth for the year?", "John Morikis", "I'd like Al to answer that, but I'd like to just begin with a question, your point about the consumer side. I think it's important to understand, we're working on these solutions that we think can help our customer and we're going to do that customer-by-customer. And as unsatisfying as this answer is to both you and us, and there's really no quick fix here.", "The short-term solution of throwing promotional money at this problem is not a solution that we're pursuing. So, the long-term solution is to help our customers drive traffic and convert these footsteps into their -- in their stores into sales and help them to drive footsteps into their stores.", "Allen Mistysyn", "So, Arun, this is Al. The low to mid-single-digits in the guidance in the third quarter certainly has the impact of our tempered view of both the Consumer Brands Group, core business and the Latin America region. And when you look at the full year at mid-single-digits that would tell you that the stores group does have to perform up in that range. And we didn't come off the year on EPS on our core at $0.14, $0.15 and that's really driven by the flow-through we saw in stores.", "So, if you look at our first half with our U.S. and Canada stores business, 7% same-store sales growth and -- I'm sorry, yes, 6% same-store sales growth and over a 30% flow-through. That would tell you that their second half has to be at a similar pace to achieve the $0.14, $0.15 with the tempered view of Consumer and Latin America.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Got it, that's very helpful. And then I guess, as a follow-up. Just curious with some of the other lag you've had over the last couple of years, protective and marine. You talked about the labor shortage and then price costs. Do you -- so your expectation as far as the question improves as the year unfolds. Do you still expect to achieve about 75% of the 5% price increase for the year?", "John Morikis", "Yes, we do and our practice of working with our customers through that process is continuing. And we often speak about the fact that we're not out there trying to jam a price increase in immediately. We work with our customers, and those phase in over in the Sherwin-Williams side in the six to seven-month period.", "It might be a little bit longer on the OE side for Valspar. It might be a six to nine-month with some of the agreements that they have. But it is clearly our intention that these products, services and the total value proposition are going to allow us to continue to push those two. But we'll do it at the right place to retain our customers.", "Bob Wells", "Hey, Arun, a quick point of clarification. The range of price increases that we took in our stores was 3% to 5%. The average was about 4%, not 5%. So, 75% of 4%.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Got it. Thanks. And any thoughts on Protective & Marine, the outlook there?", "John Morikis", "Yes. We're actually feeling pretty good about our Protective & Marine, and we had a nice turn here in the quarter for our -- and particularly, our North America petrochem had some nice swing.", "As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, slightly below our core business, but clearly moving in the right direction. And we're -- we've been talking in the last couple of quarters about the shift or pivot, as we call it, into some of these additional segments. We're getting very good traction there. There were a couple of segments that we see projects. We see them on the Board, but they've not been released primarily in the infrastructure. If you look at bridge and highway and water/wastewater, there has been some projects that are in discussion, I'd call it, but have not been released.", "The pressure -- and I also mentioned in Latin America, we saw a nice turn in our P&M business in Latin America. The two areas that we continue to see pressure in Protective & Marine, and albeit they're smaller businesses in relationship to our stores business, would be in Asia and in Europe. We continue to see pressure on our P&M business there.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Great. Thanks.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Arun.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Hey guys good morning. First off, going back to the weakness in exterior paint the last two weeks of June. Was that weighed upon by any particular region? There were parts of the country that were extremely hotter than the month of June. I guess, what are customers telling you in terms of the weakness there looking back?", "John Morikis", "Yes, the largest division that was impacted was our Southeastern division. These divisions take a lot of pride in competing with each other. And Southeast is -- has been one that has been leading the pack here for quite some time.", "And I would say, going into the final lap here, if you will, of the third quarter, they were in a pretty good position, but they clearly felt the impact in the last couple of weeks. And our Southwestern division did a wonderful job in capitalizing on that opportunity and leading the pack for our stores organization.", "Bob Wells", "And because it was Southeast has been consistently one of the strongest demand regions in the country, we do not believe that the slowdown in exterior sales had anything to do with lack of demand. There is high demand for exterior projects in the market right now.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Got it. And then even with the weakness in the consumer channel, you're still going to have to deal with higher raw material costs, I would imagine, going into 2018. Can you first give us a sense as to when the U.S. do-it-yourself paint channel realized a price increase? And then second, how do you plan on offsetting this -- the inflation that we're starting to see? Thanks.", "John Morikis", "Well, we're going to offset that by working with our customers on the need for our pricing and the timing. Al just spoke to the fact that we're bringing a little more clarity to our stores' pricing given that they are, in fact, our own stores. We prefer not to talk about pricing as it relates to our consumer business. But suffice it to say that the basket of raw materials are moving and we're talking with our customers about the needed price increases to offset that raw material basket shift.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Ghansham.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve Byrne", "Hi. Bob, your recent comments about pricing increases and so forth, is it fair to say out of that 5% same-store sales growth, 3% was price, 2% volume?", "Bob Wells", "About 200 basis points, price; the balance, volume, Steve.", "Steve Byrne", "And is there some drag on that from just a year-over-year mix shift having less exterior paint?", "John Morikis", "Well, the exterior and DIY, we had a soft DIY performance in our stores and, we believe, in the entire market.", "Steve Byrne", "And are you still lagging the raw material cost push? And do you expect that you'll be in a position to keep pushing price into 2018?", "Allen Mistysyn", "Just talking to the Paint Stores Group, I think the effectiveness that we've talked about in our price increase has been very good. I think as you talk about looking out, we're monitoring the raw material basket. And as we get a better line of sight to that, we would certainly talk to our customers first, like we have in the past. We'd also absolutely try to push back on our vendors or find our cost offsets in our own organization before we go talk to our customers. But then absent of those offsets, then we will talk to our customers first and then let you all know.", "Steve Byrne", "And then lastly, your 3% volume growth, how would you compare that to the overall architectural volume growth in the states?", "Bob Wells", "It's difficult to tell at this point, Steve, because we haven't heard enough public reports from the second quarter. It feels to us like DIY has been very slow. And the other comment I'd make is that while our exterior business was soft, we doubt we're the only one that felt the impact of slow exterior sales in the latter half of June.", "John Morikis", "I'd also say that the exterior business is oftentimes a contractor-applied product. There are certainly many DIY customers that apply their own exterior coatings. Let's say that many customers, when it comes to tackling a DIY project, would prefer that to be an interior versus exterior.", "So, we may feel a little bit -- and again, this is on the shorter term, we may feel a bit more of a pinch on the exterior gallons, given our mix heavily towards the contractor. But we've got -- as Bob mentioned, we have a lot of confidence in the trend here and we don't feel this is a demand issue.", "Steve Byrne", "Okay. Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Robert Koort ", "Thanks very much. Good morning.", "John Morikis", "Good morning Bob.", "Robert Koort ", "John, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the synergy opportunity in front of you. You mentioned you've probably had a little longer than you like to look things over and potentially have less divestitures maybe than you could have feared from the regulators. So, can you talk a little bit about what you're finding now on the synergies and what the pace of that synergy capture will be?", "John Morikis", "Yes, I'd say, Bob, here in the first 45 days -- and to your point, while we had more time than we would have preferred, there were certainly limitations to what we were able to dial into out of respect to the proper process to the FTC.", "And so truly, we've had about 45 days to dial in. And we're very confident in the numbers that we've posted on -- prior to the close about our ability, from a synergy standpoint, to drive those synergies through the organization and, importantly, as we believe, position the company for growth.", "And so we feel as though we're trending well. We feel as though there's good engagement by both Valspar leadership and Sherwin leadership and making good decisions that allow us to extract out the -- what we call value capture and, at the same time and more importantly, position ourselves for growth.", "Bob Wells", "And I would say, Bob, we have about $50 million of synergies in our forecast for Valspar core. And when you look at that compared to what we talked about when we announced the acquisition, we had about $140 million in number in our first full year, so that's an annual number. You talk about $50 million -- around $50 million at a run rate. That's probably $100 million.", "And as we get more clarity and are able to get more discussions across the selling organizations and looking at formulations in that, we'll have a better picture that we'll update guidance accordingly. And we'll give you a clear picture at the FCP conference in October.", "Robert Koort ", "Okay. And then if I might ask, on the architectural side, Valspar had different strategies, whether it was the embryonic business in Europe or what they're doing and China or even in Australia or maybe it was the combo of big-box and paint stores.", "You see any opportunity to harmonize the go-to-market in architectural businesses outside the U.S.? Or what can they do differently under your ownership than they've been doing?", "John Morikis", "Yes, so we want to look at that, Bob. That's a great point. We want to start with a customer and work back, though, not just what we could bring to that. We do believe that there are terrific opportunities, if it's technology and from a supply chain standpoint, combined with what we think will be a far more efficient.", "But the most important element here is the customer and so we're going through the process right now of working with our new team members from Valspar on the needs from the consumer and working back to what it is that we bring. And so we're excited about this. We think there are some opportunities. We're anxious to explore them. We've often referenced, you mentioned -- what might be the smallest market, but just because you mentioned it the Australian businesses we've -- they operate, I believe, 64 stores in Australia and we like -- we're anxious to bring some of the expertise that we have in running stores to that business.", "But we're the first to admit that we're not experts in Australia. So, we're connecting dots here to make sure that what's needed in the market and the opportunity in the markets that the resources, the assets and skill sets that we have in our company.", "Robert Koort ", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you, Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent Andrews", "Thanks and good morning everyone. A couple of questions on the Valspar business. As we were watching the company report during that sort of purgatory period of the transaction, the results were coming in weaker than everybody forecasted, particularly on the consumer side of things. So, as you went back and once you were able to look under the hood, what was going on there? Was there destocking taking place? Or were they losing more shelf space, or what's the postmortem there?", "John Morikis", "I'd say that the thought of their losing shelf space, I mean, first of all, you mentioned the paints business, we were competing obviously with Valspar and one very large customer. And so there was -- there may have been some shift in there. I think as we've got -- been able to pull back the curtain, if you will, I'd say that the opportunities for growth are clearly there.", "I don't know that the -- as I mentioned earlier, from a pricing activity standpoint, that they were as active as we would like to have seen. But from a volume standpoint, I wouldn't point to market share losses. I might say that they were experiencing, like we were, some softness in the market.", "Vincent Andrews", "Okay. Just as a follow-up to that, as you look forward with that Valspar paints business, I mean, do you think you'll keep the Valspar brand? Or do you think you'll try to tie that volume into what you've been doing with Sherwin, with HGTV and with Infinity or maybe another application? But what would be the pros and cons of maintaining two brands -- a dual-brand strategy?", "John Morikis", "Well, it's a terrific asset. I mean, we wanted to build on that. We think there are customers of the Valspar brand that are eager to grow, and we want to help them, and we think that the Valspar brand is a terrific asset to help them do exactly that.", "I mean, our goal would be to bring the technology and the combined services to each and every one of our customers to help them execute their strategy. And every customer is a little different. They've got different expectations and targets. And we think that combined the Sherwin-Valspar portfolio of resources, people, skills and technologies will allow us to separate from the competition.", "And so I would expect that we're going to build on those. But I'd also say that we don't make decisions for our customers. We're going to work with them and help them to make the right decision to help them reach their goals.", "Vincent Andrews", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Vincent.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson", "Thank you. John, I want to go back to your Valspar synergy comment. You said your confidence in your original $280 million assessment. But what were some of the main areas you couldn't look at until you close the company? As I look at manufacturing and distribution, that's only 8%. And looking at previous transactions you've done like Comex, logistics and consolidation and manufacturing plants tended to be a much bigger part of your synergies.", "John Morikis", "Yes. So, two. I mean, the first and largest would be the raw material costs. We're unable to look at raw material costs formulations. We're not able to look at formulations. And so when you talk about, are there possibilities for consolidation? You can't just look at a map and say, there's two facilities nearby. One is a candidate to be closed.", "We try to understand the specific needs of every customer, which we were not -- unable to talk about, the specific technology that's manufactured in a plant, which we're not able to talk about, the raw material costs, the suppliers that they're using in those raw materials.", "There's quite a bit that we were able to do and we're moving aggressively because they were within bounds and there were many areas that were out -- clearly out of bounds that we didn't get near.", "Don Carson", "And then a follow-up on capital deployment. There's still a lot of consolidation going on, on smaller industrial properties. Are you out of that market for now as you integrate Valspar? Or are you telling the Valspar people that if they see appropriate opportunities that they should continue to pursue them?", "John Morikis", "We're telling them that if they see opportunities we want to know them. We want to have those discussions. We've been very clear about -- in the short-term our focus is on paying down our debt. But often times -- it's not like we're going to the grocery store and buying something off the shelf.", "I mean, these are discussions that we have for -- often times, we've had deals that I've worked on for five years. So, we want to know from each business leader, on a regular basis, those opportunities that they feel will help them by enhancing their value proposition to their customers and we want to engage in those discussions now.", "Don Carson", "Okay. Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Don.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Duffy Fischer", "Yes, good morning. Eventually, we'll kind of subsume Valspar in the reporting, but over the next year, we've got kind of work off their public numbers. If we just look at their last 12 months of revenue and going forward over the next 12, how fast do you see topline growing from them? And then maybe kind of help get faster in one of the segments versus the other.", "John Morikis", "Yes, it's -- it really does vary, Duffy, by region, by segment. We're excited about that. I don't want to give the false impression that it's going to happen overnight. I mean, we've got opportunities to -- in many parts of the world, we have a broader assortment of products and technologies. But we're going to have to have a supply chain to be able to transfer some of those products. We're going to have to get our sales organization up to speed and aware of the technology.", "And so there's a whole lot of work going on right now and trying to accelerate that as quickly as possible. And then those were some of the things that we talked about before the close of how we were going to go about that. So we're executing on those plans right now, but it really does vary very much by segment and by customer.", "Bob Wells", "And Duffy, I would say if you look at our guidance, the $2.5 billion for the June through December. You got to remember, they're on a 4-4-5. So, we tried to make their last year comparable to ours, and with that, we think we'd be flat to up slightly, which I think is right in the range of what they've been running.", "Duffy Fischer", "Okay, great. And then just rolling LatAm into the Paint Stores Group, is that doing anything structurally to how you're running LatAm?", "Bob Wells", "No, I think what we talked about a few years ago was that Latin America, we moved under the Paint Stores Group management team and created the Americas Group back then. We just didn't report it that way. So, with a larger company, Latin America gets to be about less than 5% of our sales and profit, much less than that even, unfortunately. But it didn't make sense leave them as a separate segment.", "Duffy Fischer", "Great. Thanks guys.", "Bob Wells", "Hey Duffy.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "PJ Juvekar", "Good morning John.", "John Morikis", "Hi PJ.", "PJ Juvekar", "So, your Consumer Group continues to underperform, sales are down 11%, and I think you said it was broad based. So, I guess, my question is, what is all of this weakness in DIY? Is it that consumers are spending less on paint? Maybe they're spending more on Amazon or something like that?", "John Morikis", "No, I would say that there's certainly a shift from do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me that's likely accelerated. It's -- often times, when you talk about a consumer, little difficult to put your fingers right on what it is that's driving the slowdown in do-it-yourself.", "What we're focused on here, PJ, is ensuring that our customers are at the best position to be able to capitalize on the business that does exist out there. There's terrific market share, as we said in review with each of our customers, their goals and providing the lineup of products, brands and services to help them is what we're focused on to be able to do that.", "Bob Wells", "At the risk of belaboring the obvious, PJ, we -- while we don't like to see our DIY business in our stores slowing down, we are the beneficiaries of this shift from DIY to do-it-for-me. John mentioned in his opening comments that we've seen 13 in the last 15 quarters of double-digit growth in our Pro residential repaint business. We think that's a reflection of more people hiring professionals as opposed to doing it themselves.", "PJ Juvekar", "Okay. So, you don't think there's an issue about dollars being spent on paints or painting in general?", "Bob Wells", "No. Actually, we think that painting activity is pretty strong right now. As strong as it can be, given the labor shortages in the contractor market.", "PJ Juvekar", "Okay. And then on your synergies -- just on your synergies, are there any true revenue synergies between the two companies? And what I mean by that is are there any Valspar products like cabinet stains that you are beginning to sell through your stores?", "John Morikis", "Well, we wouldn't want to comment on that specifically. I don't think that's happening. But the point here is that we do see opportunities on the synergy side for us to capitalize. And while we're excited about them, PJ, those are not issues that we're going to lay out right now. But I will tell you that by business unit, as we're bringing these teams together, we went in with some idea and some mindset of where those opportunities are.", "And I would say, right now, we are very excited about as these teams have come together, the opportunities that they've identified that we haven't even thought of yet. So, we're feeling very good about those opportunities and the momentum. It's going to take us a little time to capture those, but we feel good about what we're finding.", "PJ Juvekar", "Okay. And lastly, can you give an update on how did HGTV paint do in the second quarter?", "John Morikis", "Well, we reported our consumer numbers. The HGTV paints specifically, we don't speak to, out of respect to our customer. We allow our customers to report their results. But we did report our consumer results and have clearly indicated that while we feel as though the market is a tough market, we want to see better performance from our team. And they're working very hard, and we have high expectations for them to outperform the market.", "PJ Juvekar", "Okay. Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks PJ.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Sison", "Hey guys. Thanks. John, you kind of opened up talking about the long-term potential for the combination. When you think about the drivers for 2018 and which is generally, a little bit long away. But when you think about those drivers to generate earnings growth, can you maybe talk about what you're excited about? And what type of growth we could see?", "John Morikis", "Yes, I'm excited about every business that these Valspar and Sherwin-Williams teams have come together and touch. I mean, if you look at the complementary nature of these businesses, they offer technology and resources.", "In many cases, they may be strong where we're not and vice versa. There's areas of strength that we have that they lack, either scale or facility. The combination of the product lines, the relationship with customers. We're excited to be a more meaningful part of the relationship with many customers, where they may have had an OE direct relationship and our focus has been on the tier suppliers into, ultimately, the OE customer.", "And so we think the combination of people, technologies, the resources, the assets, the facilities that we have, I mean, every single business, when we sit and talk in these meetings and Allen and I are working with them on a regular basis. And we walk away really, really excited about where we're headed here.", "And we're pushing hard to get it as fast, but we have a common theme that we're constantly repeating, which is we want to push hard to get it right, not just fast. And so we don't want to making commitments to our customers or to the financial community, but more importantly, to the customers that we can't keep.", "And I'll add 1 thing to you that is if you look historically at the performance of Sherwin-Williams and our ability to integrate in these facilities and technologies, I don't want to give the impression that it's just out there somewhere. I mean, we move quickly. We're moving aggressively. We just want to make sure we get it right. So, I don't give you the wrong impression there.", "Mike Sison", "Right. And just a quick, quick question on Valspar. You gave a sales for 2017, $2.4 billion. And I think you mentioned that would be kind of flattish up year-over-year. Is -- will earnings, ex synergy, for Valspar be up, flattish or down?", "Allen Mistysyn", "No, Mike. I would say that the earnings would be a continuation of what you saw in the first half on that trend that was reported. Just to be clear on what we reported for Valspar operations is their operations, less their legacy, their legacy debt would be included in that and then less the new debt acquisition financing.", "But ex the synergies and the financing, I think it'd be down. And primarily because you saw that in the gross margin in that the pressure they saw in the raw material costs. And there was typically a lag in their business in getting price and we're seeing that lag and then some. So, certainly, we're challenging our groups to get out and develop what that pricing action has to be with the customers.", "Mike Sison", "Great. Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question. Scott your line is live, you may proceed with your question.", "Scott Mushkin", "Can you guys hear me?", "John Morikis", "Hey, Scott. Yes.", "Scott Mushkin", "Great. Can you guys hear me now? Yes, okay. So, I just wanted to -- and I know the call has gone a long time, but I guess you didn't, maybe I missed to catch why you guys thought we had to slowdown in exterior in the Southeast for two weeks? And why you're so -- it seems like you're pretty confident it's just going to go away, and maybe it already has in July. But I'm just wondering the why.", "Bob Wells", "It -- as we said, it was in the Southeast and a little bit in the East. And the why, all we've said is the why was not lack of demand. And we have a practice of not talking about things like weather on conference calls, but you can't paint outside in the rain. And I think I'll leave it at that.", "John Morikis", "Yes, I'd say we were going in the last two weeks of June and came out in July very strong. We had two very difficult weeks and primarily our Southeastern division that really -- and as we mentioned this sell price and volume and everything, the contractor purchases of exterior, it really had a significant impact on our business.", "Scott Mushkin", "Okay, great. That's good color. So, then my next question, and maybe I'm traveling today, so maybe I'm missing it, seems like you guys have a lot of confidence in your back half with your core Sherwin business, is that true?", "And I guess, the thought process I have, I -- we -- DY -- do-it-yourself has, I think, a big impact on the summer quarter even for you guys. I think it's where you sell the most. So, I was just wondering if you can kind of talk us through why it seems like there's a decent amount of confidence going into the back half? And am I right about that? And what's driving that?", "John Morikis", "Yes, I would say it's safe to say that you should sense a level of confidence. And you talked about our stores organization, again, not to be too repetitive, but we're finishing 13 of 15 quarters in this residential space with a double-digit gain and we feel as though we're really growing share there. And we're really trying to put our foot on the pedal and go even faster.", "And our teams are really executing there and I think the alignment that we have in developing products and services and working with our customers is really allowing us to grow share. And I'm not -- we're not talking about is that going to slow down? We're talking internally that how we accelerate. We want to go harder and faster and further separate ourselves from our competition.", "I mentioned the penetration that we have in new residential. And so if you're like us and have confidence in the need for housing and starts and you reflect back on the fact that we've got these exclusive agreements with 15 of the top 20 builders. Yes, we're feeling good, and we're trying to grow that number, the number of builders on both the national and regional level. That we've got the right products that work for the national builders and we're trying to further leverage that for the regional builders.", "So, I mean, I can go segment-by-segment, but yes, we're feeling really good. But as I said, great people in the field, taking care of customers and we want people feeling as though our people and our stores and our reps are an extension of their business, and our people are doing a terrific job at that. We're very grateful for their efforts.", "Bob Wells", "I would add to that, though, because you specifically point out DIY. On the DIY side of the market, which would include a component of our Paint Stores business and our Consumer Brands Group, probably less confident. We think we're seeing softness in the DIY market. So, that growth is going to be a little more challenging there.", "Scott Mushkin", "Okay. May I let it go and have another question. I'll just take it offline. Thanks guys.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor", "Hi good morning.", "Bob Wells", "Good morning Scott.", "Scott Rednor", "Good afternoon at this point. Just had a curiosity relative to -- I know you guys haven't explicitly disclosed, but relative to any headcount synergies between the two companies. Can you maybe just give us a framework for what percentage of the way through or completed you are? And maybe, John, can you just kind of give us a sense for what the morale is now that the two organizations are officially brought together?", "John Morikis", "I'd say that the morale is very good. We're very transparent and open with our employees and our teams about the process that we're going through. We're not going to -- and I hope you respect, Scott, we're not going to speculate about percentages of where we are or where we are not in the process, respect to our teams and our people. Those are discussions that we have directly with them. We're anxious to get this behind us. We have good momentum, but those aren't discussions that we're going to have.", "Allen Mistysyn", "Scott, I would say if you look at the $50 million that we have in our guidance and the run rate that implies that $100 million you'd say on a three -- 120 gross run rate in year three, we're a third of the way there. So, we feel pretty good about that progress.", "Scott Rednor", "And when you think about the strategy, particularly at Lowe's, now that you have two of the power brands there, can you maybe just talk broadly about any changes in kind of the go-to-market strategy?", "John Morikis", "Our strategy for Lowe's?", "Scott Rednor", "Correct.", "John Morikis", "No, -- yes, we're not going to talk about that, Scott. I mean, again, that's a very important customer of ours and I hope you'll, again, respect that those discussions between us and Lowe's and their strategy, I mean, that's -- it's important to that each and every one of our customers respect that those are confidential discussions and our job is to help them execute on their strategy.", "Scott Rednor", "Okay. I guess, just lastly then, John. I think you made a point about pricing and in the Industrial Coatings business is an area that has kind of trailed expectation, but reasonably so, just given that the deal has taken some time to close. I think previously, when you guys have gotten into businesses that were a little bit different than Paint Stores you've been very slow to implement price increases if I go back to, Sayerlack or Becker. And over time, you created a lot of value, but that took some time to come through the P&L as maybe the financial community saw it.", "Is this a different situation? Is that the right blueprint? I'm just kind of curious if this means you could do something more immediate than what we saw as that kind of blueprint.", "John Morikis", "Well, I'd say that you're exactly right, Scott and very observant. You know our company well. And historically, we've always taken that approach, which is we're going to work with our customers through that process. And the acquisitions that you described were, in fact OEM suppliers mainly. And so we worked with those customers.", "Our goal is to always come through the tunnel with our customer and the price. And so we work appropriately with our customers to ensure that the value proposition is there for them and their ability to enhance the value of their products through that process. So, you're right, it's going to take a little bit of time.", "As I mentioned earlier, we've typically looked at a Sherwin cycle of maybe taking six to seven months to implement a price increase. And on the Valspar side, it might take six to nine months. But the value proposition is strong. The same teams are the ones executing, the same products and technologies. And so we've got confidence in our ability to do that, but we're not going to lose our heads and go out there and try to do it overnight. We want to keep our customers.", "Scott Rednor", "Great. Thanks for time.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Eastwood with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Stephen East", "Thank you. Good afternoon guys. John there's been -- you've had a lot of questions asked about price and trying to reaccelerate your back half of 2017. Before the merger actually occurred, a lot of talk about raw material purchasing benefits, et cetera. Haven't really heard any conversation on that. So as you look at the second half of 2017, how big a part -- how would you sort of rank order where that raw material purchasing synergy would be in improving your volumes or your up margin as you go forward?", "John Morikis", "Yes, Steve, it's a good question. I might answer a little differently and that is referencing back to the previous question. We have confidence and we've not seen anything that keeps us from being anything but confident in our ability to reach the synergy targets that we have.", "They're going to lay in -- Al mentioned that run rate that we're at. I don't think it's in our best interest to parse out where we are on each of those individual synergy buckets as we're pursuing them, but you should expect raw materials was a big one. You should expect that we're being very aggressive in pursuing those and our goal is to try to capture those as quickly as possible.", "Stephen East", "Great. Okay. Fair enough. And then I know we've beat consumer like a dead horse here, but I'll ask you one more. The segments didn't hunt down as much as you all have been the first half of the year. What do you think is going on? You've talked about not just using promo dollars to try to recapture but to drive. So, what do you think was going on in your business that maybe wasn't happening in some of your peers that you got to correct?", "John Morikis", "Well, we're always interested in improving our performance. I do have to -- I think it's important to make a statement here that I believe that, again, with limited PoS data, we don't see all the data from our customers. I would tell you that our sell-through at retail is in line with what we believe to be the rate of the DIY market.", "I do think that the inventory connection -- correction may have been a little stronger on some of the products as we've walked into some of these programs. And at the same time, while we're learning about the program, our customers are experiencing a little softer market than what we would like to see. And so I think there's been some adjustment accordingly. But as far as the market goes, I think our out-the-doors are performing similar to what we expect the market is performing.", "Bob Wells", "The other point I'd point out, Steve, is that segment includes a business unit in Europe. So, it may not be an apples-to-apples comparison looking at our volumes versus our peers. Europe, the second consecutive quarter, was the weakest performing part of the Consumer segment. So, we're getting a drag from overseas.", "Stephen East", "Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.", "John Morikis", "Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, this is Matt on for Kevin. I just have two one's for you. Your management teams across the space have indicated kind of 2Q is probably the peak for raw material pressure on the year. As we look into 3Q and 4Q, just given the lags, kind of how much of an actual decline do you expect to see of this Q2 peak?", "Bob Wells", "Matt, this is Bob. The change in raw material cost year-over-year probably peaked in the second quarter. That's only because we're starting to annualized price increases from last year. We did see chemical-grade propylene settle back after a pretty significant spike in the first quarter and we don't expect any major swings over the balance of the year. So that's probably good news.", "But MMA remains very tight. TiO2, we're probably going to see more traction on pricing in the TiO2 market. So, I don't expect raw material -- the basket to decline. In fact, the basket, we're going to see a little incremental inflation going forward. It's just that the compare gets easier as we go forward. So, our outlook for the full year is still mid-single digits, but we don't see a lot of goodness in the back half in the way of deflation. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And Valspar had another business, which housed corporate costs and adhesives businesses. Kind of where the earnings from that adhesives business is going now? And can you quantify how much earnings that business generates versus what the prior corporate cost was on an absolute level?", "Allen Mistysyn", "Matt, the -- their -- with their resin and colorants business that was in that Admin [ph] segment is now in our Performance Coating segment. But no, we won't be breaking the specifics of the segment profit out for that business.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, and corporate costs just got tallied into your own? It's that what I'm guessing.", "Bob Wells", "That's correct.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.", "Laurence Alexander", "Two very quick ones. Just on the regional same-store sales comments you made in the beginning, can you talk just a little bit, can you characterize the dispersion between your best regions and your worst regions? And is that dispersion, any wider than normal?", "And secondly, with respect to share gains that you're going after in the back half of the year and going forward, are there any areas where you are reversing a trend rather than building on momentum you already had?", "John Morikis", "Let me answer that last one. I'd say the area that we started to see some positive that would still may be characterized as reversing, I would say, would be the Protective & Marine. That has been under pressure for a couple of years now. And this -- we clearly saw a shift in the petrochem, and there's still more opportunity there. And I'd say that there's -- I'd characterize that in that manner. Regarding the -- I'm sorry, the division question you had was.", "Allen Mistysyn", "Geographic dispersion of results from -- in the five regions.", "John Morikis", "Yes. So, you talked about the gap between them?", "Bob Wells", "Yes.", "John Morikis", "I don't --", "Bob Wells", "Well, high single-digits in the strongest region to low single-digits in the weakest, all being positive on revenue and volume.", "Laurence Alexander", "I guess, where I was getting at is, is that any different than what you normally see?", "John Morikis", "It's -- that's -- there's always a little bit of a gap, I'd say.", "Allen Mistysyn", "Might be a little bit wider--", "John Morikis", "A little wider maybe. ", "Allen Mistysyn", "Than usual.", "Laurence Alexander", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts", "Thanks guys. Were any synergies in wood coatings in the original $280 million? Or were you assuming you're divesting that all along?", "Allen Mistysyn", "There -- in the original, there probably was some, John, but not significant enough on a $225 million business on a $4.2 billion company to matter.", "John Roberts", "Okay. And then the inventory write-up sounds like you'll completely flushed by the August period. Is the fourth quarter going to be -- as you see it right now, there's no unusuals in the fourth quarter, at least in your full year guidance. It's there. Maybe something might change by then, but at least in your guidance right now, is there any year end significant accruals for compensation or something that might affect comparability in the fourth quarter?", "John Morikis", "No, not right now.", "John Roberts", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher Perrella", "Hi, good afternoon. Quick follow-up, housekeeping. When will we see more pro forma data? What's the timing on that?", "Allen Mistysyn", "I think, Chris, what we're prepared to do is at the FCP Conference, we'll give you more color and more guidance on the performance of Valspar and the combined entity and the synergies that are occurring. I think after 45 days, it's a little tough to have a lot of confidence in some of the things that we just thought. So, we're shooting for the FCP Meeting.", "Christopher Perrella", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Allen Mistysyn", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Good afternoon guys. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I'd just like to follow-up a little bit. I know it's a small segment for you, but Latin America saw negative -- or negative operating profit in three of the last six quarters and a pretty big step-down in the profitability this quarter. Is it all sort of timing of raw materials? Are there other some issues with volume growth or declines? Can you talk about sort of why that business performed as poorly as it did on the margin line in the second quarter? And what should we look forward to in the second half of the year?", "Allen Mistysyn", "Dmitry, the -- when you look at our Latin America region, Brazil is the largest portion of that business. And as you well know, that it's just been in turmoil. So, you see a lot of short-term choppiness. We expect that to continue over the short-term.", "Over the long-term, that market, it's the ninth largest economy. As they work their way through the turmoil and regain their footing, we expect that to be a good market for us and expect to see growth and a return to the profitability of that region.", "John Morikis", "Yes, I'd say Latin America, outside of Brazil, we see a good trend. We're growing our share and financials are pointing in the right direction. And to Al's point, Brazil is such a big percentage of -- the weight of Brazil on our overall South American operations is pretty heavy.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "And can I follow-up? I think you mentioned that in your Coatings segment in your Industrial Coatings business, you identified Latin America as sort of a good guy in terms of delivering strong growth. So, kind of why the discrepancy between the Industrial segment and the Consumer segment in that economy? I would imagine that both would be impacted by the political turmoil.", "John Morikis", "Yes, you're exactly right. And let me add one more. Our store performance, our own store performance in Brazil is actually positive performance as well. Such a big part of that business, Dmitry, is third-party through home centers and distributors, and they're calling on consumers. And the consumers' confidence in that market is clearly shaken.", "But you're exactly right. If you look at our automotive, our wood business, our general industrial and Protective & Marine businesses in Latin America, they were all positive. It's the architectural consumer business that's under pressure.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay, that's helpful, John. And then just as a quick follow-up on Industrial Coatings business, particularly the Valspar piece of it, which has been decelerating pretty meaningfully in terms of margin in the last couple of quarters and through the last reportable segment that they had or the reportable period that they had.", "You mentioned sort of lack of productivity on price increases. Was that the main driver of lower margins? Or was there some mix impact there? And how do you feel about that in the second half of the year? Can you at least stem the declines and kind of stabilize them at these levels before price increases kick in what sounds like in 2018?", "John Morikis", "Yes, I'd say we're going to continue to feel pressure through the end of the year. I'd like to say they we're going to be able to turn this around quickly here, Dmitry. But I think, this is a process when you're involved in these acquisitions.", "First of all, it was a very long FTC process, and sometimes people get a little distracted, and I respect that. And quite frankly, you have competitors that are in there trying to create opportunities. And so we always see this as well. The competition kicks up for a short -- for a little bit and they're aggressive and so we feel some pressure. And they've done the right thing. They've hung on to the business. The volume is actually hanging in there. It's the gross margin that's under pressure.", "And so as I mentioned earlier, and again, I don't want to be repetitive, but we've got great confidence in these leadership teams that are now part of our team. And these are the same leaders and same product services, as I mentioned earlier. And it's up to us to continue to demonstrate the value proposition to our customers and to earn that incremental margin to offset the raw material costs and we've got confidence in our ability to do that.", "Historically, they've been able to do that. Everything's consistent and we're going to continue to work towards that. We're going to do it at the right pace.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Got it. Okay John thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Harrison", "Hi good afternoon.", "John Morikis", "Hey Mike.", "Mike Harrison", "John, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on how you and the regulators arrived at the Valspar wood coatings business is the piece that would need to be sold. And can you maybe talk about the approach to the industrial wood coatings market going forward? Is that something that you can attack in North America with just the legacy Sherwin position?", "John Morikis", "Well, your first question about how did that we arrive with the regulators, I mean, that's a normal process review, which we're very respectful for the process that the government goes through, and we responded to all their requests. The did their due diligence, including not only our information, but Valspar's, but also customer information and they made a decision.", "And while we may have had a different opinion in many areas, and that is part of the process, you're able to express your thoughts, ultimately, they made a decision and we had to respect that. And so we find ourselves now exactly where the FTC would want us, which is in a competitive situation with the new entrant.", "And yes, you're exactly right, we're going to compete for that business and I don't think the FTC or any other government agency would have it any other way. The competition is good for the consumer and we're going to be out there looking for that -- those customer relationships.", "We have a good industrial wood business or they would not have required us to divest the one that they required. So, our teams are going to be working hard to try to grow their business. And some of those customers will certainly be legacy Valspar customers. But I'll say this tongue-in-cheek, we don't discriminate. We'll take customers anywhere we can get. So, we'll be working hard with all customers' opportunities.", "Mike Harrison", "All right. And then was just curious, in the consumer brand's business, have you received any clarity from some of the retailers that you sell through about how they're going to address multiple brands potentially in the same product category now being under the same ownership? Is that the situation where you could expect to potentially lose some incremental shelf space?", "John Morikis", "Or gain -- or gain share. We're having those discussions every day. And again, it goes back to the same value proposition. It's upon us to help our customers be successful. That's our goal. That's how we measure our success. Our success is making our customers successful. So, we're making those discussions every day. And we've talked openly about the need for volume.", "And so while we talk about value capture, raw material costs, all those things, the day starts and ends with discussions about growing volume and growing sales and we do that by aligning ourselves with our customers.", "Mike Harrison", "Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Yes, thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So, I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Jesse. I'll wrap-up quickly by remind you all that our annual Financial Community Presentation is scheduled for October 3rd, in New York at the Marriott Marquis. The program will consist of a brief business review by our segment leadership teams, followed by a more detailed update on our Valspar integration plans and progress.", "We'll host our customary Q&A session followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Tuesday, October 3rd. Please look out for registration information sent via e-mail in mid-August.", "As always, I will be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. If you'd like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001 and she will add you to the callback schedule. Again that number is 216-566-3001. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

An archived replay of this webcast will be available at the www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two-hours after this conference call concludes, and will be available until Wednesday, May 06, at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. After the review of the first quarter results, we will open the session for questions.", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're going to begin the call this morning as usual with a brief recap of first quarter 2015 results, by John Morikis, our President and Chief Operating Officer. Then Chris Connor, our Chairman and CEO, will provide some perspective on the quarter and our expectations for second quarter and full year. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions, and Sean Hennessy, our Chief Financial Officer and Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller, are with us this morning, to participate in the Q&A session.", "Before I pass the microphone to John, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements, as defined under U.S. Federal Securities Laws, with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided on our earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. In the interest of time, we've also provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our Web site, www.sherwin.com, under the Investor Relations tab, first quarter press release.", "With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the first quarter.", "John Morikis", "Thanks Bob. If you\u2019ve listened to our earning calls over the past few quarters, you may detect the familiar pattern in today\u2019s release. Once again, in the first quarter, we saw good momentum in most of our domestic businesses and less favorable results from our non-domestic operations.", "I\u2019ll begin by highlighting overall Company performance for first quarter 2015, compared to first quarter 2014, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 3.5% to a record of $2.45 billion, driven primarily by higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores and Consumer Groups. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 3.1% in the quarter.", "Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $56.5 million in the quarter to $1.13 billion. Our consolidated gross margin increased 120 basis points in the quarter to 46.2% of sales, from 45% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in this quarter resulted from higher sales by Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, and increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $45.1 million over first quarter last year to $929.2 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 37.9% in the first quarter this year from 37.4% last year, due primarily to the incremental investments in the Lowe\u2019s rollout.", "Interest expense decreased $4 million compared to the first quarter last year to $12.4 million. This decrease was due to the rate difference between the $500 million and five-year notes we retired in fourth quarter of 2014, and the comparable increases in our short-term borrowings.", "Consolidated profit, before taxes in the quarter, increased $27.2 million to $193.2 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 32% compared to 30.5% in the first quarter of 2014. For the full year of 2015, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s compared to the last year\u2019s rate of 31.2%. ", "Consolidated net income increased $15.9 million to $131.4 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 5.4% compared to 4.9% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 21% to $1.38 per share from $1.14 per share in 2014.", "Now, looking at our results by operating segments. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter of 2015 increased 7.5% to $1.46 billion from $1.36 billion last year. Comparable store sales, sales by stores opened more than 12-calendar months, increased 6.4%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales volumes across all end-markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter.", "Regionally in the quarter, our Midwestern Division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern Division, Eastern Division and our Southwestern Division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Segment profit for the Group increased $30.3 million or 20.7% to $176.6 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equivalent sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 12.1% of sales from 10.8% in the first quarter of last year.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales decreased 8.9% to $156.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation that was partially offset by selling price increases. Volumes in the quarter were slightly positive but currency translation rate changes decreased sales in the U.S. dollars by 13.9% in the quarter.", "Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to $9.5 million in the quarter from $10 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit by $3.4 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 5.7% in the quarter compared to 5.5% in the first quarter of 2014.", "Now, turning to Consumer Group. First quarter sales increased 8.1% to $351.7 million due primarily to the initial shipment for the HGTV HOME by Sherwin Williams paint program to Lowe\u2019s stores. Segment profits for the Consumer Group increased $4.3 million to $55.4 million in the quarter from $51.1 million in the first quarter of last year.", "The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to increased operating efficiencies that were partially offset by higher SG&A spending related to the HGTV HOME rollout. Segment profit, as a percent of external sales, increased to 15.8% from 15.7% in the same period last year. ", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 5.6% to $459.6 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by higher selling prices. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 6.9% in the quarter.", "First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $7.6 million or 16.3% to $38.9 million due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes which decreased segment profit $4.4 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit decreased to 8.3% from 9.3% in the same period last year.", "That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I'll turn the call over the Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year. Chris?", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, John. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. First quarter was a good quarter from a profit perspective, but revenue clearly came in a little below our expectations.", "This is largely a result of two factors; the impact of unfavorable currency translations on sales was a little worse than we anticipated in our guidance; and HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams shipments to Lowe's in the quarter, were slightly lower than we expected, due entirely the timing. This combination reduced revenue growth in the quarter by a little more than 150 basis points versus our guidance. But neither of these factors affect our expectations for the full year in anyway. We remain bullish in our outlook, for both sales and earnings, as we were in January.", "From a profitability standpoint, earnings per share in the quarter grew 21% and consolidated sales growth to 3.5%. Our incremental margin and consolidated profit before tax was more than 32%. And as a percent of sales, gross profit expanded to 120 basis points, operating profit margin improved 60 basis points and profit before tax improved 90 basis points.", "SG&A was the only line in the P&L that went to wrong in the quarter, and that was by design to support the rollout of HGTV HOME at Lowe's. Both of our domestic operating segments reported solid sales and profit results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group got-off to a strong start in January and a soft patch in February, but regained their momentum in late March.", "Comparable store sales growth of 6.4% in the quarter, overcame the drag from the 283 Comex stores, now embedded in the comp. We\u2019re encouraged by the fact that the locations we\u2019ve converted to the Sherwin-Williams format have shown immediate improvement in DIY and residential repaint business, the two highest gross margin customer segments.", "During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 21 new stores and closed 14 redundant Comex locations. Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 100 net new locations. ", "Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean, stands at 4,010 locations compared to 3,925 one year-ago. Consumers Group\u2019s 8.1% sales increase and 10 basis point improvements in segment profit margin in the quarter, both reflect the impact of the HGTV HOME load-ins at Lowe's. If you back out the Lowe's shipments, the Group\u2019s core sales in the quarter were roughly flat year-over-year.", "The profit margin and incremental sales was only 16.4% due to higher SG&A spending to support the HGTV HOME rollout. Our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group got-off to a slow start for the year due in part to unfavorable currency translations and in part the soft-end market demand. Both segments, however, reported positive sales volumes in the quarter, but by indeed fall a little short of offsetting negative currency impact.", "In spite of the inventory build to support the Lowe's program, our working capital ratio decreased to 10.9% from 11% in the first quarter of last year. If you back out the effect of the Lowe's rollout, working capital of sales would have been about 10% at the end of the quarter. The reduction in working capital, combined with the increase in net income, more than offset the incremental cash used for Comex store integration and the HGTV HOME rollout in the quarter. As a result, net operating cash in the quarter improved by approximately $28 million compared to our first quarter cash performance last year.", "During the quarter, we acquired 2.0 million shares of the Company stock, or treasury, at an average cost of $287.75 per share for a total investment of $575.5 million. On March 31st, we had remaining authorization to acquire 3.23 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors, approved a quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share, up 22% from the $0.55 we paid last year.", "Our outlook for raw materials continues to evolve as we get further into the year. The drop in petrochemical feedstock prices, combined with steadily improving monomer supply will likely result in declining latex and resin prices in the back-half of the year.", "At the same time, high grade chloride titanium dioxide pricing has softened a bit from recent quarters due to continued weakness in global demand and excess supply. From these developments, we expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the industry to be down in the mid single-digit range in 2015 compared with low single-digit outlook we gave in our year-end 2014 call.", "As I commented in my opening remarks, we remain optimistic that U.S. residential demand for architectural paint will continue to strengthen as we move into the prime painting season. And we\u2019re encouraged by growing signs of the robust commercial recovery. This growth will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year.", "Our outlook for the second quarter of 2015 is for consolidated net sales to increase 6% to 8% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.90 per share, nearly a 30% increase at the midpoint compared to last year\u2019s record $2.94 per share.", "For the full year 2015, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2014 by a high single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectations for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $10.90 to $11.10 per share, compared to $8.78 per share apparent in 2014.", "Again, we\u2019d like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "First up, can you just touch on the competitive environment in the paint industry in the U.S.? Just anecdotally listening to your lot more of promotional focus this year across many channels. Just wondering what you're seeing.", "Chris Connor", "Ghansham, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re seeing any more aggressive promotional activity than we would typically would at this time of year, and we\u2019re kind of entering into the start of the paint season. And that\u2019s pretty typical for our industry to -- and send traffic and value them with promotions, pricings are holding as you can tell by our margin improvement. So, I think it's pretty much business as usual.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "And then just in terms of the timing that you called on the HGTV load-in. Can you just kind of give us some more color on that, what drove the shifts specifically?", "Chris Connor", "So, we\u2019re very pleased and confident in the rollout and in our revision of product projections. And what\u2019s happened here is that we gave some initial thoughts on how this thing would rollout. The quarter happened to land in the midst of a pretty major rollout. So, there are some stores that are shipping week, maybe two-weeks later than the original plan. But it's nothing we\u2019re concerned with, and we\u2019re very confident of the direction and the rollout and way it's going.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "And just one final one if I could on what you're seeing if anything different on wage inflation for your U.S. stores? I\u2019ll leave at that. Thanks so much.", "Chris Connor", "Our wage inflation has been pretty standard for a long time Ghansham, based on a formula we look at given the current market and industries we adjust our annual compensation. Those wages have increased on average 2% to 3% per year for our employee base for many years as they will again this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "John McNulty", "So with regards to your 2Q guide, it's implying pretty significant lift in the margin on a year-over-year basis on the operating side. So I guess I am wondering, if you can walk us through some of the puts and takes on that. Is it just, you finally have the Lowe\u2019s platform out and ramps up or I guess how much if its being -- is it just the end of some of the Comex headwinds from last year? I guess if you could kind of walk us through some of the major puts and takes that really give you confidence to hit that kind of a margin level that\u2019d be helpful?", "Sean Hennessy", "This is Sean Hennessy. Good morning. When you look at the second quarter and when you look at that guidance going from 294 to the midpoint of 380, our margins, I don\u2019t think you can get into that kind of the range with that kind of sales gain, without having margin expansion. And the operating margin expansion I think it's going to be -- you're going to see margin expansion in the gross profit line and I think that you're going to see some efficiencies in the SG&A line.", "The only way you can get there so -- but I think, we\u2019re coming over, coming against the Comex integration. We feel really good about the Comex integration and this is where the business is at. I mean, we feel very good, if we can get gallon. It\u2019s also has to do with the sales curve in the second quarter and in the third quarter, the Stores Group in Consumer will be a larger percentage of our total sales.", "So a couple of things happened there; number one, we\u2019ve always said an incremental gallon in those two groups, are the best incremental gallon flow through as we have in the Company; and number two, even though foreign currency is going to be a headwind in the second and third quarter with the sales curve again outside the country be in a smaller percentage of the total, that headwind will actually be smaller in the second and third quarter. It comes back in the fourth quarter.", "So, all those things are working in that direction. And I think operationally, the Store Group is in great shape and the Consumer Group is in great shape. And they are going to lead the profit improvement in the second and third quarter.", "John McNulty", "And then maybe just one follow-up question. With regard to the HGTV rollout, when we think about the actual cost and how they sequence in throughout the year. I guess how should we\u2019d be thinking about kind of the lumpiness of that as you\u2019re ramping this up, do we see a lot in the first quarter and then it went down or do we just see a lot and then it starts to get offset more by revenues coming in, like how should we think about that?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think couple of things there, the last quarter I mentioned that we have 12-months of SG&A because it can\u2019t just turn on our organization in mid-March. And we had nine and half months with the sale. So, the first quarter because it is the smallest quarter, the SG&A impact was the greatest and that's why you saw in the first quarter our SG&A was 5 times higher than last year.", "In the second quarter, there is a lot of advertising, and lot of SG&A promotions going on in that second quarter. And then you\u2019re going to start seeing the SG&A flat now. And so -- and I think from the expense, second quarter maybe is a largest actually. But the first quarter is probably the most, the toughest comparison for us. And then you will see the SG&A get to a more normal running rate in the third quarter and fourth quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent Andrews", "Thanks very much and good morning everyone. Just had a question, if you we could sort of try to bridge this full year from here and your guidance stay the same. It sounds like in the quarter, you felt like your volumes could have been a little bit better. You had the issue with the buy-in at Lowe\u2019s and now you\u2019re saying that FX is obviously worse, raw materials are going to be better across the balance of the year. So, could you just kind of help us understand what's in treating the guidance the same, what are the things like on an underline basis, what's gotten better, what's gotten worse? And if you shift-out some of the things that are outside of your controls, is the year progressing, the same or better or worse than you expected three-months ago?", "Chris Connor", "I think you did a great job for answering that question.", "Vincent Andrews", "Well. I'm looking for some dimension on those issues, not just the high level?", "Chris Connor", "We began the year with pretty robust guidance EPS in the 25% plus ranges and strong domestic volume and none of those things have changed for us at all. I think some of these issues are a little bit around the fringe on us. FX is definitely more of a headwind than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year. But as you know this is a Company that remains primarily a U.S. focused revenues story.", "So for that end, it will be an impact for us but a lumpy that much, offsetting that is a little better raw material forecast than we had given you to begin with, we\u2019ve plans for good raw material favorable impact, it's getting a little bit better than that. So, you put a couple of those little marginal puts and takes together, the real driver, as Sean just commented, will be the strong results that we're expecting from our Stores Group, the Consumer Group, in North America in 2015.", "Vincent Andrews", "Okay, and if I could just ask a follow up. You mentioned that it's related to your Store business that south west was the richest evolved and was that -- is there any particular reason for that or is there anything notable about that or is that just kind of stacked up?", "John Morikis", "It's interesting that you pointed that out. If you noticed also, that Midwestern was the leading division and this time a year, it's obviously our Midwestern Division leading. Clearly, some of the weather that impacted south west had a direct impact on their sales. We don't like to talk about weather. We keep our heads down and drive our sales. But it clearly in that Division had an impact.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "P.J. Juvekar", "Couple of questions on HGTV, can you talk about the initial reception of the paints in the stores or is it too early? And what would be the margins on this product compared to your Consumer Group average?", "Chris Connor", "So, I\u2019ll give you some thoughts P.J. and kind of the early run rate and let Sean comment on the margins that at least what we\u2019re prepared to say. As John mentioned, we're really right in the middle of this rollout. May 1st is the official and national rollout day. We will absolutely be set in every store and ready to go. I\u2019d say we probably have two-thirds of the store set at this point [John]. And so we are starting to see some really strong reorders and excitement inside the aisles at Lowe\u2019s stores.", "The color merchandising unit that is gone in and it's been terrific, it's really creating quite a stir. And so, I would say that from every angle that we can look at it this program is really on track with our expectations and off to a good start.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And what we've said P.J. about the operating margin, the only thing we've commented on is a couple of things. Number one, we're not going to put out a P&L by customer, we never have loaded a customer P&L and we really are not going to start doing that. But what we have done is said that this program during the calendar year 2015 will give us low single-digit increase for the Company.", "Last year our sales were around -- were just slightly over $11 billion and that gives you an idea of what kind of sales we have in our guidance. But when it comes to operating margins, we've said at the beginning with slightly dilutive in the fourth quarter for some of the expenses and it will be slightly accretive in the calendar year 2015. And then we're going to see much a nice pop in our operating margins in 2016. And that's really all we\u2019re really prepared to say.", "P.J. Juvekar", "And Chris in the past you had talked about your global ambitions and making acquisitions outside the U.S. with a strong dollar, it seems like a good time. Can you just talk about your price line and what are your thoughts about that? ", "Chris Connor", "I think we've been very open P.J. with our investment community regarding our appetite here. We have a strong interest and continuing to strengthen our architectural coatings platform throughout Latin America. And we talk about our industrial coatings businesses on a more of a global basis. And so, there are a number of interesting ideas that we\u2019re discussing. And at the right time, we\u2019ll be happy to let you know about them.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson", "Two questions, first on consumer, Sean I think on the last call you said that operating margins were actually declining year-over-year because of the cost of the HGTV rollout and yet you\u2019re slightly higher. So I\u2019m just wondering what went on consumer to offset that from a margin standpoint? And then secondly, just wondering on sort of you Q2, Q3 paint season, what are your contractor customers telling you in terms of their bookings outlook, both on residential and non-residential?", "Sean Hennessy", "Don, I would tell you probably one of the very nice surprises was the ability for our Consumer Group to have operating margin improvement. And I think there is two pieces, there was the piece on the selling side. But on the manufacturing and the logistics side, they had a very good quarter. And because of that ability, they actually were able to have a operating margin $0.01 higher this year than last year. But they were helped by the incremental gallons that they were producing and so forth -- and they put some of those gallons on our balance sheet, which took a little debit and put it on there that you didn\u2019t see come up in the second quarter. But that\u2019s what really drove the operating margins in the first quarter to be one-time higher.", "Chris Connor", "I will take the question regarding the contractors and how they\u2019re feeling. And I would describe it as very bullish. I\u2019ve been around the country and in talking with our people as well as our customers. There is a very strong level of confidence. There is a very high level of bid activity. And they\u2019re very excited about this year. Our non-paint sales of spray equipment and related sales are very-very strong. And that\u2019s all tied to the confidence that they have in the market.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Good morning. In Paint Stores, will you comment on how your spray equipment volumes would have compared to the segment average same store sales figure 6.4%?", "Chris Connor", "Our spray equipment sales are extremely strong, very strong.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Double-digits, perhaps?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Kevin McCarthy ", "Okay. Good to know. Thank you. Then second question for Sean, if I may, typically your net debt balance expands seasonally it seems in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. But this year the jump was roughly double what you\u2019ve been running historically. Would you comment on that and what might be driving it?", "Sean Hennessy", "I can tell you a very quick that we just added here an accelerated factory purchase in ASR in the first quarter. So in the month of February, as John commented, we did purchase 2 million of shares in the first quarter. We did that use in an ASR. And so that\u2019s why, you saw a use of cash of approximately $585 million. So in the last few years, we\u2019ve been a little more cautious in buying stock in the first quarter. But this year, when we were looking at the cash generation of the Company and what we\u2019re going to do with the cash, we feel very good and we want the 2 million shares. At the end of the year, we still believe that our debt, our total debt will be in that one-to-one range with our EBITDA.", "Kevin McCarthy", "And last one if I may, it sounded like the HGTV load-in was running slightly later than you\u2019ve previously anticipated. But other than that, were there any March to April timing shifts that you would consider noteworthy?", "John Morikis", "I don\u2019t think there is anything noteworthy in that. And I\u2019d like to just be really clear on that HGTV. We have some projections on how this would rollout. And this is just simple matter of having some areas that we\u2019d planned on moving a week or a couple of days in some cases just falling on the other side of line of the quarter. So, to be clear, not sending the wrong signal here it\u2019s just a matter of very simple timing and where the quarter landed in the midst of this rollout. So it\u2019s according to understand now as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Just wondering if you can give us an update on what you\u2019re seeing I guess earlier on the spring paint season to safely get out as we expected. Thanks.", "John Morikis", "We expected a strong start to the season and our contractors would tell you that they\u2019re very excited about that. There is a strong pipeline of this as I mentioned earlier and there is a good feeling about that. I think many of the contractors experienced a little bit of delay in some of those projects starting with some of the weather that they face. So, we\u2019re excited about paint season.", "Chris Connor", "And Arun, to clear a little context around that, the American Coatings Association came out with their forecast of volumes for 2014 and \u201915, a couple of days ago, and their outlook for this year is for annual growth of 5.6%, but first quarter growth in more in the 3% range. So, they kind of anticipated a slow start but a really strong season to follow.", "Arun Viswanathan", "And just some clarification on the industry numbers, and would that bring us closer to kind of a normal level of gallonage in 750 million range or where do you think we are tracking on the year?", "Chris Connor", "No, they actually took their 2014 number down a little bit. We\u2019ve been talking about 2014, 3.5% growth year. They actually knock that down to about 2.5% or 2.8%. So, they finished the year in the range of about 720 million gallon. If you put 5% on top of that, we\u2019re still not back to where we think this cycle is going to peak, or even normalize with that.", "Arun Viswanathan", "And then just as a last follow-up. Can you differentiate any activity in new construction versus repair and remodeling, and how the two segments are going? Thanks.", "Chris Connor", "Historically, repair remodel has been about 80% of the industry. So, a smaller percentage increase in that segment will move the needle on gallons a lot further. Repair and remodel, we covered earlier than new construction, it has remained strong. We\u2019ve commented for a while now that residential repaint is the strongest growth category that we\u2019ve seen. But if you look at that, the numbers particularly in the housing market year-to-date this year, we\u2019ve seen really strong activity in new home sales.", "So in fact permits have actually lagged sales so withdrawn inventories down, we would expect a very robust building season in the spring, given that the inventories are as low as they are now. So, repaint has led the pack, but new home constructions will be a strong contributor this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Bob Koort", "I wonder if you guys could help describe for me when a consumer comes into a Lowe\u2019s, what is the selling proposition to HGTV brand, what is the differentiator there and maybe what fits on that price point scale?", "John Morikis", "When you walk into a Lowe\u2019s store Bob, you're going to see immediately the impressive color presentation at the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams makes. That really starts the shopping experience, those color centers are at the end of their drive aisles, they\u2019re close to the very entry points to their stores, a good number of Lowe stores that we\u2019ve been in since the rollout has begun.", "We were able to pick out that color center literally with the assessment time to store. So, I think that\u2019s going to create excitement and impressions for the department. Once the consumers made that choice, if it's an HGTV color, then they are inclined to look for the HGTV product and then Lowe\u2019s associates will be trained to help them make that. I think as we\u2019ve commented in the past that both Valspar and PPG remain in the department. They will have product offerings as well too.", "So this will be a typical experience for all the boxes in managing multi-supplier lines in the department, and it\u2019ll be the merchandizing and quality and then the association will help drive that preference for HGTV HOME.", "Chris Connor", "The confidence factors, I think with the colors are lesser and the coordinating of the colors is another compelling feature of the HGTV. So the consumer with confidence can choose the color as well as coordinating colors go along with that.", "Bob Koort", "And do you guys -- well you\u2019ve completed by May 1 on the ground training at every Lowe\u2019s location?", "Chris Connor", "Absolutely.", "Bob Koort", "And then last thing real quick if I may. You mentioned Latin America raw material inflation. Could you describe what was going on there in the context of expectations for deflation on the horizon?", "Chris Connor", "The majority of the raw materials are price in U.S. dollar, so when the currency devalues it's in fact always a raw material increase for the different countries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.", "Nils Wallin", "First off, I was wondering if you could size the accretion that you might have seen from Comex this quarter.", "Chris Connor", "This integration is going great. And I think that what we\u2019ve said is last year we\u2019re at $0.28 and for the year we\u2019re going to be at $0.10. We feel it's going to be here. But as it is so integrated now, where we don\u2019t feel confident on a quarter-by-quarter basis to give you that kind of detail, so that\u2019s why I think we\u2019ve said that in the future, we\u2019re not going to be commenting on this acquisition.", "Nils Wallin", "I am curious there wasn\u2019t -- I mean paint stores is usually pretty much a U.S. dollar type business. But obviously with Comex coming in, there is heavier Canadian footprint and the Canadian dollar did depreciate year-over-year. So, was there any sort of FX headwinds in the Paint Stores group?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, you're exactly right, with the Canadian sales in the Paint Store Group. There was some headwinds but we break-out the 3.1% for the Company we don't break it out to that by the segments.", "Nils Wallin", "And then you just mentioned in the previous question about the raw materials in Lat-Am being priced in dollars, so that sounds like it\u2019s a transactional type FX effect. Is there any opportunity for you to switch that or buy more locally to offset those FX headwinds going forward?", "Chris Connor", "Not on the major titanium dioxide and some of the other major resins and so forth. So, that's the situation we're in. There are some -- a small percentage of the raw that we do buy it locally, but not enough to offset that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "I\u2019d just like to tie up a couple of outstanding questions that I have. In the Global Group, could you provide a little bit of a granularity between volume and pricing, what the components of revenue was outside of FX?", "Chris Connor", "What we've said is that if you think about it, we said that our sales were down 5.5% and we said that our gallons were up slightly. So, that we did quick pricing in there in the local currencies, but not enough to offset the currency hit. But the volume is up slightly.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay and the price increases, was that mainly -- this is both for Latin American and the global group. The price increases that you mentioned, that was mainly to offset the deflation in the currencies, I would imagine?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "In terms of your guidance for the year, it sounds like with increased foreign exchange headwinds you\u2019re nevertheless looking for high single-digit growth for the year sort of reported sales, so it sounds like the organic sales growth expectations have improved. Is that a correct read through and sort of what is behind that? Is it just the optimism in the stores business with the contractors benefiting from commercial construction, or are there other drivers to your more upbeat expectations for organic performance in 2015?", "Chris Connor", "You\u2019re right I think everything you said that was accurate. We still believe that for the full year we\u2019re going to make it, and we also pleased that foreign currency is going to be a slightly stronger headwind than we get three months ago. I will tell you, we still remained pretty confident in that range, because as I tried to point out the 3.1% is very strong in the first quarter. Even if the currency remains exactly the headwinds in the second quarter and third quarter, that number should reduce.", "So -- and I would say you have to remember, if we did have some foreign currency devaluation in the guidance already, so that's frequent 1% with that 100% incremental, we did have some. So it's just that incremental piece. And when you look at the range of let's say 7% and 9% that 2% on $11 billion $220 million we still feel that we're in pretty good shape to get inside that range.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Got it, got it. And then the final question, you talk about raw material sales in the mid-single digits for 2015. You also mentioned that you expect that to really take place in the second half of 2015. So are we to interpret from that that second half 2015 may see more like a double-digit decline in raw material cost for the year on your basis?", "Bob Wells", "I don't think so Dmitry, this is Bob. I don't think it will be that strong. We\u2019ll have to see, I think the linchpin is going to be TiO2. We\u2019ll have to see what happens with TiO2 in the back-half. But I would say that back-half will likely be in the mid maybe upper mid single-digits.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. So, the back half will be mid to high single-digits. Okay. Got it. Thank you. That\u2019s all the questions I had.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Dennis McGill", "Good morning guys. Thank you. First one, Chris, you had mentioned I think -- the term used in February was a low in February and I think you said that it took until the second half of March to pick up, just want to confirm that the first half of March looked more like February? And then if you could maybe just frame a little bit what was the difference between what you saw kind of exiting the quarter and what you were seeing during that low Period?", "Chris Connor", "That\u2019s exactly why we [multiple speakers]. Yeah, sure Dennis. That is exactly what we said. February was a soft month for us and March started little softer, February started to pick up. But Sean made a brief comment about weather in the quarter, as we started to see some warmer days, we really were seeing the acceleration of all this confidence that -- and back there which is professional and training contractor.", "I think what's notable is that it's winter in the first quarter. It's supposed to be cold and Boston supposed to have the kind of snow at head, and we had stores closed, et cetera. That really wasn't the impact. It was the cold south of the Mason Dixon line that really had the impact. And just as we commented about our Southwestern division kind of lagging a division it typically lead to that time of the year. When we got some warm weather in those parts of the geography, we really started to see it's a rebound. And now that we're into the second quarter, weather really diminishes, has been impacted. And again back to the strong guidance we're giving there.", "Dennis McGill", "And I guess just indirectly, the guidance you\u2019re giving on the sales on an organic base in the second quarter sort of suggests Paint Stores sales are getting back to that high single-digit rate?", "Chris Connor", "Correct.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And then separately on the global side, I think when you back out FX, this quarter was modest growth and I think there\u2019s something more in the four, five range recently. Can you just talk to where do you think that continues and if so just give some color on what you see in different geographies and different end users?", "John Morikis", "The performance by business unit varied. And not surprisingly, our business in North America across every category was stronger than a relatively weaker performance in Latin America and Europe. And obviously part of that was due to the currency. We expect in local currency for these businesses to improve. And over the balance of the year, we feel we\u2019ll get on top of it. So, we\u2019re confident about the year and the projections we\u2019ve given you.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay.", "Chris Connor", "In Latin America Dennis in the first quarter, we had volume gains in every country quarter with the exception of Brazil and it\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve seen that, so we currently feeling better about our prospect there as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Greg Melich", "I want to follow up quickly on SG&A, just to make sure I have this right. So, if you haven\u2019t had the HGTV program with SG&A levered in the first quarter, and if you were to think about it going forward, we do expect the lever, the corporate basis in the second quarter but probably not in consumers. Did I summarize that right, Sean?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, the only thing that we didn\u2019t had say is that we would have shown some efficiencies in the first quarter with SG&A. Without that I think that we don\u2019t want to break that out. And the reason we don\u2019t want to do that is that how much we spend exactly on the Lowe\u2019s program. But we would not have had the 5 times of increase in SG&A.", "Greg Melich", "It would have gone the right way. It would have been down, we don\u2019t know how much?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Greg Melich", "And then the follow up, I want to talk a little bit more about the outlook there. I know we\u2019ve talked about resi and it looks greater there in the contractors. What about commercial and industrial? What sort of region you see there? Is there any sort of project work going on or is that not dialed up or is that just sort of as planned?", "Bob Wells", "No in fact -- Greg this is Bob, there is a quite bit of project work going on. And due to the long start to paint cycle in the non-residential space, you kind of got to look back a year or more at the data. And if you look at 2014 data in terms of signed contracts, non-residential rebounded pretty strongly, up about 7% in total with -- as we\u2019ve pointed before, some really strong categories in office and bank, hotel and motel, manufacturing, et cetera.", "And so there are certainly -- there is certainly growth across the country. There are specific categories that we can target to grow faster than the market in total. And by the way, those were contract, I just talked about, but we also a big jump in starts in the fourth quarter of '14. There is lot of projects coming out of the ground that will be painted this year. So, it\u2019s looking a lot better than last year. And that\u2019s mostly driven by occupancy rate, which also implies that the retail market will be strong in non-residential this year.", "Greg Melich", "And then lastly I know it\u2019s early. But what do you expect the HGTV program at Lowe\u2019s to do to the program in your own Paint Stores Group? Do you expect it to help to hurt anything in there in terms of your plan will be helpful.", "Chris Connor", "The HGTV HOME program inside the Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores Group format is not significant contributor to our overall revenue. Having said that, we think the additional exposure for the brand, the additional advertising, some of the upgraded color features and labeling which will impact both the Sherwin store offering as well as Lowe\u2019s store, will have a positive impact. So, it should be marginally better to flat, will be our expectation.", "Greg Melich", "And Chris is there a lag to that do you think or do you anything it sort of happened over the advertising, et cetera, kicks in or is it -- ?", "Chris Connor", "I think we\u2019ll see in the second and third quarter when we really expect the ramp up, the marketing activity type.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Ivan Marcuse", "Just a couple of quick questions, I believe your gross margin range, typically -- I think you said it past couple of quarters, 43 to 47 with the lower gross margin, with lower raw materials. Do you expect to exceed that range this year or would you expect to sort of move that range overtime as that impacted the additional volume that you\u2019ve gotten over the past couple of quarters?", "John Morikis", "Ivan, you are absolutely right. We believe that this range, we recently we talked about the 43 to 46, 44 to 47, we think we\u2019re really in a 44.5 to 47.5. I would tell you that would be the range that I would give today.", "Ivan Marcuse", "Okay, great. And then you mentioned there is whether every year, which there is. I\u2019m curious have you seen any impact of the lower oil costs hitting the economies, the tax authority any other energy impacts in terms of construction or housing or anything to that effect?", "John Morikis", "Not really. I mean we\u2019ve spent some time with our team down there and they\u2019re feeling pretty good about the marketplace. So there has not been any impact in our increase down there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay McCanless", "First question I had, I am trying to catch up with Comex and how many of those stores are now part of the actual comp group to make up your comp store sales for the Paint Stores?", "Sean Hennessy", "283.", "Jay McCanless", "On a percentage basis of the store you acquired, where does that stand?", "Sean Hennessy", "So we have required 306 of 283 so that makes 306 is about 93.5%.", "Jay McCanless", "It's a meaningful part of the comp group at this point, you're not going to get any more catch-up from the stores rolling in.", "Chris Connor", "We have approximately close of 4,000 comp store. So, there are 283 of the 4,000 stores, it's half of 1%, I am sorry I thought you were asking a question of how many remaining.", "John Morikis", "September of \u201913 right, so they are fully in the comp number that\u2019s a point we\u2019re making.", "Chris Connor", "Jay, do you mean, what percentage have we converted to Sherwin stores?", "Jay McCanless", "No, I wanted to see if they were part of the comp group already, now you already answered that. My other question is on SG&A in 2Q \u201914, is there any one-time items in there that aren\u2019t going to reappear this year just trying to frame our model for how SG&A is going to look.", "Chris Connor", "When you look at that SG&A with 31.8% and $970 million, it really was one-time only.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "You covered a lot of ground. But the one thing I want to ask you John is it looks like CapEx bumps up quite a bit year-over-year in the first quarter. Is there anything going on there?", "Sean Hennessy", "Chuck, we said that our CapEx would be high this year, around 220 million to 240 million. And what we\u2019re doing is converting those Comex stores that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it this year. So, as those conversions occur, we\u2019re continuing to spend approximately $100,000 per store and that\u2019s an ongoing cost.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Will you get them all done this year?", "Chris Connor", "Go ahead John.", "John Morikis", "We\u2019ll get most of them done and the largest part of it. There will be some perhaps in Canada that\u2019ll roll-over and maybe a little bit out on the West Coast. But largest part we\u2019ll get it mostly done.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "And finally, any other significant projects in the CapEx budget for 2015?", "Chris Connor", "No, I think that\u2019s the major take there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Can you remind us what percentage of Sherwin-Williams\u2019 consolidated sales are non-paints or non-coatings?", "Chris Connor", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given that dynamic. I think we\u2019ve talked about the stores and so forth. But I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given any. And the reason why is because it diversify, and we have brushes and rollers, we have costs and so forth. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever given that metric.", "John Morikis", "We\u2019ve given you some directional help there Jeff. I think we say our stores are 70%, 75% coating sales, the rest of the spray equipment, et cetera. Our Consumer Group would be probably same range 60%, 70% range in coatings, brushes and rollers or you consider us all paints, paints or specialty and that might be a different way to look at it. But in all our Global Finishes Group it would be coatings.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "And then secondly, do you think that there will be any sequential change in your overall prices or for the industry in 2Q or 3Q? Has the general price outlook appear on a sequential basis?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, we think that if you look at the selling prices, there is a lot of activity going on. But pricing has been fairly stable. Just to remind you the last time we put a price increase in, it was early January 2014.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "And then lastly, what\u2019s the size of the DIY business in the stores? And will the consumer say, I can get Sherwin-Williams paint at Lowe\u2019s, I really don\u2019t need to get it out the stores. Do you think that there might be a trade-off for the consumer or no?", "John Morikis", "We\u2019ve been consistently at about 15% of that Paint Stores Group revenue [indiscernible] the DIY consumer. We don\u2019t expect that to change substantially one way or the other.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Geoffrey McKinney with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Geoffrey McKinney", "Just a follow-up on the share repurchase side. The utilization of short-term debt to fund that acceleration, should we think about the balance sheet kind of sustain a normal debt balance, that coming down or being refined and termed out? I'm just curious how we should think about that going forward.", "Chris Connor", "I think you should think about that it's going to come down our launch is at the end of the quarter it will be the first quarter. I also think, you should think about turning this out. We\u2019re looking at issuing some bonds this year the timing is not exactly public yet because we haven\u2019t decided exactly when. One of the things about it, you've seen our interest rate was -- our interest expense was 4 million less than the first quarter than last year, which is positive. Because when we did -- when the bonds matured, our five-year bonds matured in 2014, we did that re-issue. But we\u2019re so heavy into short-term debt I think as I said earlier I think our debt by the end of the year will be in that one-to-one range of EBITDA and you will see fixed notes in a much higher percentage of our total debt.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts", "Just in under the wire here. Good morning, guys. You're off to a slow start in the new store openings here. It\u2019s normally a little bit of a hockey stick anyway and back-end loaded but it looks even more so this year. Should we expect you to get fully caught up there?", "John Morikis", "You should expect us to continue to run in around 100 new stores rate, we try to press these deals earlier in the year. For some reason a lot of them end up at the tail-end of the previous year. But there is a really very good pipeline that good teams working on it, we\u2019re excited about our pipeline of new stores this year.", "John Roberts", "And then if the raw materials are down mid single for the year and down mid to high single in the back half of the year, one of the things that are down the most in that outlook. Is TiO2 something that is at the higher end, or are some things above the high end of that that might be down even double-digit?", "Chris Connor", "I think John from a timing standpoint we're seeing more relief on the petrochemical side of the basket early in the year. And to get to mid to upper single-digits by the end of year, we would need to see a slide in TiO2. So, I think that that would probably, on a percentage basis, perhaps put TiO2 to down more than the petrochemical than most to the petrochemical side of the basket. But right now, that is not the case.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering, we talked a lot about from selling price increases offsetting FX devaluation and so on. But as your raw material costs are coming down, do you anticipate some selling price pressure having to cut some of your pricing obviously outside of contracts?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Not significantly or haven\u2019t impacted all I don\u2019t think really. The large jobs are always competitive we close those accordingly. The raw materials are one element of the products that we are -- one component of what goes into the selling price are services that we provide and the quality of the product, the people that we have with our customers all are a component of that. So, I think we\u2019re going to continue to see the pressure where we always have seen it, but nothing anymore than we have in the past.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "All right, thanks. And then you also talked about the high level of expectations or satisfaction rather from contractors. Do you see any change in the do-it-yourself? Do you see that particular part of the equation growing still this year? Or do you think that people have more or less repainted what they were going to repaint for the last couple of years?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Well we never think that Rosemarie, as soon as we\u2019re finished. But we continue to see, across the entire country, a shift towards the painting contractor away from the DIY just as a demographic that our country support, and aging population and less free time, et cetera. Having said that, the remaining portion of the market, which is around 40% of all the gallons of purchase price DIY, we would expect this to be a good year.", "Bob has mentioned about residential repaint being one of the strongest segments, residential repaint is both DIY and pro and we\u2019ve seen nice growth there as well too. We have given color on our DIY sales gains inside the stores organization and the Consumer Group is mostly DIY. So, we would expect to see nice results for this year.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And the HGTV is also DIY, correct?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "That is correct and that will be an impact as well.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay. And if I may, how long do you expect this housing recovery to continue based on your experience, based on historical data? Do you think it has another two years to go, another three years any thoughts? ", "Bob Wells", "Rosemarie -- this is Bob. We\u2019ve said kind of -- we didn\u2019t think for the last couple of years, that we really like the pace of this recovery that we\u2019re not seeing huge year-over-year increases in activity on either the residential or non-residential side of the market. And at this measured pace, depending on where the market peaks exactly, it could certainly go another three to five years.", "We think that 1.3 million to 1.4 million residential starts is normal. But we\u2019ve been running below that normal rate for quite a while now for a number of years now. And so there should be some catch up required that would require us to go above the normalized rate at the peak of the recovery. So, we can be three to five years from the peak.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "That is great. And if may ask for one last question for Sean, as you fix a lot of your short-term debt, you are obviously going to do it at a higher rate. Could we look at next year having interest expense increase by about 3%, is that more or less what we should be looking at?", "Sean Hennessy", "4.5% when you think about next year. And I would say that 4%-4.5% between 2016 and 2014, depending on the timing we felt we saved 4 million the first quarter. If we do a deal this quarter, you\u2019re not going to see that same savings. If it goes to the third quarter, you will see two quarters of it. So, that\u2019s why I think probably compared to 2014 is the right one way to look at for year.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And when you say -- so what you are saying so I am making sure I understand is that the rate will be about 4% to 4.5% above whatever you had in 2014, or is it that your interest expense will go up by that amount?", "Sean Hennessy", "The interest expense.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. Wells for any final remarks.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you again, Melisa. As a reminder, our Financial Community Presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 28 at The Langham Hotel in Boston. The program will consist of our customary morning presentation with a question-and-answer session, followed by a reception and lunch with the Company management.

(VAL) F4Q09 Earnings Call November 23, 2009 11:00 AM ET", "Executives", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board & Chief Executive Officer ", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President & Chief Financial Officer", "Analysts", "Jason Minor - Deutsche Bank", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup", "Silka Koopf - J.P. Morgan", "Don Carson - UBS", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Amy Zang - Goldman Sach", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Valspar Corporation year end conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions)", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your Chief Financial Officer Ms. Lori Walker. Please go ahead.", "Lori Walker", "Good morning everyone, and welcome to our earnings conference call. Today we will be covering results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Bill Mansfield, our Chairman and CEO is with me on our call this morning.", "A couple of brief comments before we begin; first, I would direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning which contains much of the information that we\u2019ll be covering in the call. Also a quick reminder that this call is subject to the forward-looking statements language contained in our press release as our comments this morning may include forward-looking statements as that term is defined by Security\u2019s Law. This morning, I\u2019ll cover our fourth quarter and full year results. Bill will make a few comments particularly about our 2010 outlook. Then we\u2019ll get to your questions.", "We were quite pleased with our strong earnings performance for the quarter. The improvement from our third quarter guidance was driven by better than expected sales primarily in the coating segment and the benefit of a lower than expected tax rate. Fourth quarter sales totaled $776.6 million, a 15.9% decline from last year driven by a decline in volume one less week of sales and unfavorable currency.", "As a reminder, our fourth quarter this year includes 13 weeks versus 14 weeks in 2008. This extra week only impact our domestic business which accounts for about 60% of total company revenues. So adjusting for currency and the fourteenth week, sales for the quarter declined 9.9%.", "For the full year, sales totaled $2.879 billion a decline of 17.3% from last year. Adjusting for currency and the extra week, sales declined 13.2% from fiscal 2008. Fourth quarter adjusted net income per share increased to $0.53 in 2009 from $0.42 in 2008. Fourth quarter adjusted net income per share in 2009 excludes a $0.04 per share charge related to restructuring actions.", "Fourth quarter adjusted net income per share in 2008 excludes a $0.13 per share charge related to restructuring actions, a non-cash charge of $0.03 per share for Huarun minority interest share and a $0.09 per share after tax gain from the sale of assets.", "Net income from the fourth quarter of 2009 was $49.9 million and reported earnings per share were $0.49. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2008 was $38.9 million and reported earnings per share were $0.35. Again the underlying earnings per share comparison for the fourth quarter is $0.53 in 2009 and $0.42 in 2008, a 26.2% quarter-over-quarter increase.", "On a full year basis, again adjusted restructuring and the non-cash charge per Huarun in both 2008 and 2009 and a one time gain in 2008. The underlying earnings per share comparison is a $1.77 in fiscal 2009 and a $1.57 in fiscal 2008, a 12.7% year-over-year improvement.", "For the fourth quarter our gross margin was 36.4%, up from 28.3% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Both years exclude charges related to our restructuring actions. Margins benefited from a combination of better raw material cost comparisons, productivity gains resulting from completed restructuring actions and an improved product mix.", "Adjusting for restructuring charges in 2008 and 2009 and the gain from the sale of assets in 2008, operating expenses were 24.1% of sales up from 19.6% in 2008 with the increase primarily due to expense de-leveraging on the decline in sales. On this adjusted basis, as I just mentioned, operating expense dollars for the quarter increased $6 million versus last year due to higher incentive compensation which was partially offset by favorable currency and the benefits from our previously completed restructuring actions.", "The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34% down from 34.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year our tax rate was 32.8% compared with 34.1% in 2008. The full year tax rate was lower than anticipated due to a combination of a favorable geographic mix in earnings and favorable adjustments related to prior years. For fiscal 2010, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 33% to 33.5%. Average shares outstanding were up around $1.6 million from last year due to option dilution.", "In the quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares for $54.4 million. Average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were approximately 102 million and are projected to be 101.5 million for the first quarter of 2010. Recaping our sales performance for the quarter, our core growth defined as volume price mix was down 14% driven by a decline in volume and an extra week in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Currency was negative 1.9% for the total decline of 15.9% in the quarter. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency and the extra week in 2008 volume price mix declined 9.9% primarily driven by volume. Looking at our segment results for the quarter, adjusted for currency and the extra week of 2008, our coating segment sales declined 14% reflecting continued weakness in global industrial coating market.", "Paint segment sales were basically flat reflecting volume growth in our global architectural product line which was offset by weakness in automotive refinished markets and promotional spending in Asia related to building our brand. Sales in other declined 18.9% due to the weakness in the US coating markets.", "Looking at segment sales for the full year, again adjusted for currency and the extra week in 2008 coating segment sales were down 17.7% significant weakness in our industrial product lines were offset by our packaging product line where sales were down mid single digit for the year. Paint segment sales declined 2.7% with sales in our North America architectural product line up low single digit for the year. Sales in other were down 21.7% for the year.", "I am now going to move into a discussion of our EBIT margins for the quarter and the full year and all the numbers that I will be discussing exclude restructuring charges in both years and a one time gain in 2008.", "So, addressing margins for the quarter by segment, our coating segment EBIT margin was 16.8%, an increase from 10.9% in the fourth quarter of 2008. Our paint segment EBIT margin was 13.2% up from 9.4% in 2008. The EBIT margin for our other category was negative 23.5% compared with negative 10.7% in the fourth quarter last year primarily reflecting the decline in revenue along with higher incentive based compensation. As a reminder other includes corporate expenses.", "The total company EBIT margin for the quarter was 12.5%, up 390 basis points from our 2008 fourth quarter margin of 8.6%. Looking at margins for the full year, our coating\u2019s EBIT margin was 12.9%, up from 9.8% in 2008. The painting segment EBIT margin for the year was 13.1% compared to 9% last year. The EBIT margin for other was negative 11.8% compared with negative 2.4% in 2008. Total company EBIT margin for the year was 11%, a 250 basis point improvement from 8.5% in fiscal 2008.", "Moving to the balance sheet, our net debt at the end of the year was $693 million, a decline of $59 million from the end of the third quarter and a $140 million from the end of fiscal 2008. The decline was driven by improved operating cash flow which was partially offset by share repurchases and the buy back of the Huarun and Orient shares.", "For the fourth quarter operating cash flow was a $182 million up from a $156 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. On a full year basis, we generated $220 million in free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow, less CapEx and dividends. We estimate free cash flow of approximately $150 million in fiscal year 2010.", "Our net debt to capital was 31.5%, a 490 basis point improvement from 36.4% at the end of fiscal 2008. We ended our quarter with $609 million of reserve liquidity that includes $421 million of available committed credit facilities and $188 million of cash. This reserve liquidity was an increase of $74 million from the end of the third quarter and an increase of a $179 million from the end of fiscal 2008.", "Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $24.6 million, up from $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the full year capital spending was $57.9 million versus $43 million in 2008. Our forecast for 2010 capital spending is approximately $80 million.", "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $19.6 million down from $21.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. Depreciation and amortization for the full year totaled $82.9 million and includes $7.6 million for accelerated depreciation due to restructuring. Our full year forecast for depreciation and amortization in 2010 is approximately $77 million.", "A quick update on our restructuring actions before Bill makes his remarks. To-date we have taken a total of $0.34 per share in charges. $0.16 per share in fiscal 2008 and $0.18 in fiscal 2009 with 60% of the charges in cash and the other 40% non-cash. We continue to expect the total restructuring program to cost $0.35 to $0.38 with the remaining $0.01 to $0.04 impacting the first quarter of fiscal 2010.", "For the full year and 2009, we saw approximately $0.13 per share in total savings from restructuring. In fiscal 2010 we expect to see about $0.08 to $0.10 in carry over benefit which is included in our guidance. As mentioned in our release, our earnings guidance for fiscal 2010 is a range of a $1.85 to $2.05 per share which excludes restructuring charges.", "With that I will turn the call over to Bill, for his comments on 2009 and the outlook for 2010. Bill.", "William Mansfield", "Thank you Lori and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. As Lori mentioned, we were pleased with our strong earnings performance for the quarter. Despite significant decline in sales our operating margin for the quarter increased 370 basis points.", " Results benefited from new business and share gains in many of our product ones, improved efficiency in our operations resulting from our restructuring and productivity actions and improved raw material cost comparisons. At a $1.77 per share, our earnings for the full year were better than the high end of the 167 to 172 range we had projected on our third quarter call. There are two main reasons for the earnings improvement.", "One, as Lori mentioned, our overall tax rate in the fourth quarter was better than expected, which added about $0.02 per share. The second and more important reason was better than expected sales in our coating segment across all product lines.", "Sales were better than expected due primarily to share gains and the accelerated impact of our new business efforts. Overall, the year unfolded very much along the lines that we had expected, our global architectural packaging, automotive refinish, and EPS product lines all performed well. Our general industrial coil and wood product lines faced extreme top line challenges.", "We made remarkable progress in reducing our overall cost structure and lowering the breakeven point in these top-line challenge business and all three remained profitable and turned in more than reasonable results considering the very difficult global economic conditions in industrial markets. We benefited from the impact of our restructuring actions earlier than anticipated, did an outstanding job of controlling expenses and deliver productivity improvements in our manufacturing operations.", "By focusing on our customers, our business teams were able to generate new business and gain share in key markets. We generated $220 million in free cash flow for the year, an increase of $55 million from 2008, and despite the challenges presented by economic conditions we were able to maintain our investments in building our brands and the development of leading edge technologies.", "We are understandably proud of what our management team and employees were able to accomplish during the year under very challenging economic conditions, delivering double digit earnings growth on a sales decline of 17.3% for the year, reflects our focus on operational discipline and effective execution.", "Looking ahead to 2010 we expect modest revenue growth. Many of the industrial markets we serve are not improving but do appear to have stabilized. As we demonstrated in 2009, we are confident in our ability to generate new business and gain share under these conditions. We also anticipate ongoing pressure on raw material cost continuing a trend that began in third quarter. And we expect that upward pressure on material cost to continue throughout 2010.", "Before taking your questions I want to make sure that clearly articulated the assumptions that have gone into our 2010 guidance range of a $1.85 to $2.05 per share. We expect a modest top-line growth due primarily to our new business efforts and share gains. ", "We expect upward pressure on raw material cost to continue our guidance does include expected carry over savings from our restructuring actions, our results will continue to benefit from our productivity improvement and cost control programs, will continue to invest in our brands and in differentiated technologies, and finally, again, will deliver strong free cash flow.", "With those comments I will open the call up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jason Minor - Deutsche Bank.", "Jason Minor - Deutsche Bank", "Bill, I realize it\u2019s a very uncertain environment. It\u2019s a bit wider range than you guys have historically given, and I wonder if you could help us to understand is it just general economic or demand uncertainty, is it more of pricing of raw materials or what is it that might be driving the uncertainty there more than in the past?", "William Mansfield", "Well, granted it\u2019s certainly a wider range by $0.10 than the narrower range we gave last year. So I will acknowledge that point Jason. And I think the range reflects more of the uncertainty with regard to the top-line environment. I realize they are in some quarters the recession has been declared over, we don\u2019t quite see it that way, and so I would tell you that our range in earnings more reflects hopefully an upside in the top-line.", "Jason Minor - Deutsche Bank", "That\u2019s helpful thanks. On the raw materials then, you mentioned that you expect continued pressure, is that what you are seeing presently and then do you expect that that supports strong pricing or do you expect more price erosion back to your previous point?", "William Mansfield", "Well we started talking about the raw material cost back in our third quarter call at which point we mention that we were seeing some upward movement basically the low point was probably back in the early summer, late spring and that is continuing. We expect that we\u2019ll face those same pressures into 2010 and as we have said in the past, we will do the right thing long term for both our customers and our shareholders.", "Jason Minor - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. One last one, could you elaborate a little on where you are gaining share and what is driving that? You mentioned that a couple of times.", "William Mansfield", "Yes. Well, a couple of things, number one, our two basic strategic fundamentals are the strength of our brands, clearly in the architectural consumer paint business in North America we have gained share in 2009. Also, in our businesses that are differentiated on technology we have gained share in our coil business, coil coatings business, some in our general industrial business and we are really quite pleased with our new business efforts across the whole company this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from P. Juvekar - Citigroup.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup", "If you look at the three businesses that have really been challenged wood, coil and general industrial, looking at the past quarter and the past year, is it the case that the weakness has really been volume driven that pricing is held or have you experienced a significant pricing pressure in those three businesses?", "William Mansfield", "I think my comments apply certainly to these three businesses and to several others that clearly its volume challenge. The impact and the effects of the downturn starting in early 2009 continue normal for the full year, is clearly a volume driven event.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup", "Okay. And for those businesses, do you think the demand improvement you saw in 4Q is sustainable into 2010, or is visibility still limited? Is there any of those three businesses that you feel more comfortable about in terms of underlying demand?", "William Mansfield", "No, I would tell you that our visibility to underlying demand is cloudy to say the least, we were pleased and very pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, but they were not a result of an underlying fundamental increase and what I will call core demand. It was basically an acceleration and are delivering sooner of our new business efforts where our value proposition to our customers in a number of these businesses was quite compelling and we gained share. So it\u2019s not as a result of what I would tell you as an underlying uplift in sort of basic demand.", "Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup", "Okay, and I guess one last question, over the past few quarters customers have been extremely hesitant to build inventories, can I assume it is still the case or are you seeing any customers coming back and looking at rebuilding inventories?", "William Mansfield", "I think there was a little bit of inventory building going on over the second half of our fiscal 2009, but I would tell you at this point that we do not see any inventory building trend at all in any of our businesses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan.", "Silka Koopf - J.P. Morgan", "On the coating side, are any of the share gains related to some of the consolidation that happened in the industry, and maybe then some of like the resale of like, powder coatings asset to other players?", "William Mansfield", "I really couldn\u2019t point to a singular industry event that resulted in what occurred in our fourth quarter. These efforts that we saw come to fruition or efforts in some cases started two years ago, and we were quite fortunate that a number of them hit within the same quarter. So, no, I don\u2019t think there has been any material impact at all from industry events.", "Silka Koopf - J.P. Morgan", "Then there is typically like some seasonality in the business, like the second half was always much stronger than the first half, and given where margins particularly in the coating business have moved to in the second half of \u201809, do we see margins above 15% in the third quarter and like close to 17% in the fourth quarter. Are those margins that are sustainable going into next year? Obviously not in the first half which is weaker, but do you expect your margins to continue to improve next year?", "William Mansfield", "Yes we do. But I think we have to be careful because sequentially is where we sometimes can get into some confusion. Our weakest quarter in terms of demand is historically our first fiscal quarter. So when you look at it sequentially at our operating margins in the fourth fiscal quarter of this year, it will decline somewhat in the first fiscal quarter because of just weaker top-line and this historically has been the case. But for 2010, we would expect that we would see very positive results from our continued productivity efforts.", "Silka Koopf - J.P. Morgan", "And in terms of pricing, what prices in the coatings business positive this quarter?", "Lori Walker", "The pricing was pretty much neutral in the coating segment quarter-over-quarter. So we have anniversaried a good piece of it. So there is a very small amount but it\u2019s pretty much inconsequential quarter-over-quarter.", "Silka Koopf - J.P. Morgan", "And how about in architectural paints?", "Lori Walker", "Same story, and actually in the paint segment what you saw was low single digit volume and then you had offset with some price mix, unfavorable price mix and about the same amount, and that\u2019s primarily related, as I mentioned earlier to the promotional efforts in our Asia architectural business to promote the brand.", "Silka Koopf - J.P. Morgan", "And the last question on just cash performance in 2010. Of the restructuring charges taken in 2009, was all of the cash already paid out? Or do you know what amount roughly may still flow on 2010?", "Silka Koopf - J.P. Morgan", "You know what I am not sure I know that number off the top of my head. I\u2019ll probably have to get back to you on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Don Carson - UBS.", "Don Carson - UBS", "A question just on you\u2019re architectural; you seem to, you mentioned up volumes year-over-year yet the overall industry is down. What\u2019s different about your mixes? Is it a little exposure to commercial, is it share gains? I mean how do you do better than the overall industry here? And do you think that the industry as a whole should start to pickup now that we continue to see improvement in existing home turnover?", "William Mansfield", "Well, we\u2019ve benefited from three things. Number one, there was a clear trend in emersion the market in 2009 where the DIY channel was considerably stronger, I think it\u2019s fair to say than the professional channel. Number two, the investments we have made in the Valspar brand and some of our other consumer brands clearly paid off in 2009. ", "The consumers were choosing our brand as opposed to other choices they may have had in the market, and frankly the relative strength of our retail partners, all three contributed to us outperforming the market. Certainly, we would hope that the market would improve next year and I think it\u2019s just too uncertain for us to tell you that we see that.", "Don Carson - UBS", "Okay. And just a question on pricing. Do you think pricing power exist to us at some of these higher rows. And what specific rows are you most concerned about. I mean Ti02 still seem some what soft, I know they are trying pricing increases. Is it more just the general up-tick in oil and what that does to solvents and other raw materials?", "William Mansfield", "It\u2019s a general up-tick in input cost that have occurred over the last six to nine months, there is not any one particular issue that I would point out on the call. And again, as I said in the past, we will do the right thing both for our shareholders and our customers over the long term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Saul Ludwig - Keybanc.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "Lori, didn\u2019t you say something about operating expenses rough $6 million and I didn\u2019t that right, but if I did what were you referring to there?", "Lori Walker", "Saul, what I was referring to is that if you actually adjust both \u201808 and \u201809 for restructuring charges, and then adjust \u201808 for the gain on the sale of assets that we had last year, and then look at the absolute dollars of expenses they will be up $6 million year-over-year.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "That\u2019s with the SG&A category or is that in the plant operating costs?", "Lori Walker", "That\u2019s SG&A.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "SG&A, if you exclude all the specials.", "Lori Walker", "Correct.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "That\u2019s the reported number, it looks it\u2019s up much more than that.", "Lori Walker", "Correct.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "Got you. In your guidance about the raw materials, do you think they are going to be up 3% to 5%, 5% to 10%, where is your thinking that it is embedded into the guidance. I realize it\u2019s probably a range. But what light can you shed on that?", "William Mansfield", "Saul, number one, I think it\u2019s unclear to establish an absolute number. We have seen this trend, this gradual trend of increasing material cost. If economic conditions improve as a number of people think they will, we would expect that pressure will continue, and we have incorporated our concern about that into our guidance.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "Okay. And your revenue guidance, how do you think about FX which was kind of a negative all year, and given where the Euro is now or what it would look like, that could be a pretty important plus number in 2010, maybe Lori has got some thoughts on that.", "William Mansfield", "Well, sitting here today Saul you are right that FX should be a positive contributor to the top line next year", "Lori Walker", "To the top line, but if you recall because we do business in those countries and the bottom line it\u2019s an immaterial impact.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "I was looking at it in the context of your revenue forecast for next year is to how you would incorporate FX.", "William Mansfield", "Right, when I talked about modest however I was talking more really to a certain extend Saul to bid ex-FX. It was more about modest in terms of what results we would expect from our new business and share gain efforts on a volume basis.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "So FX would be plus or minus depending on how it plays out.", "William Mansfield", "Exactly, I can\u2019t forecast the FX markets as you know.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc", "Then just finally, actually when we think about your first quarter, your first quarter of fiscal \u201809 was kind of the eye of the storm if you think about it, the months of November, December, January, would you think that the effect of things are somewhat better than they were then that we should see at least a positive comp, without quantifying the degree, but positive comp in terms of your earnings in the first quarter since they were, I think weak for a couple of years in a row.", "William Mansfield", "Yes, we would expect our earnings for the first quarter to be up Saul versus last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Schwartz - First Analysis.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Generally a question about operating expense and if I could just go back to compare to a couple of years prior. If we just look at FY06 and your revenue level there, close to what it was for FY09, but your SG&A is up quite a bit. And so, with that as a reference point can you just give us an idea as revenue might continue to grow and so forth over the next year or two, what would happen to that expense?", "William Mansfield", "Well, if we are taking today as a baseline of SG&A expenses and say the revenue starts growing, what\u2019s going to happen to expense line? Clearly, we do not expect and will not allow the SG&A expenses to roll anywhere near the rate of revenue. In fact we expect them that we would be able to hold them fairly firm and generate operating leverage as a result of top-line growth.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "What has happened between \u201806 and \u201809 here where you have got it up by 80 or so million dollars and yet you are at a similar revenue level?", "William Mansfield", "The driver there Steve is that we actually had a couple of acquisitions. So we have the Huarun acquisition, we have the Aries acquisition, and then you have the significant decline in the top-line due to the global recession. ", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Okay. Just moving over to the balance sheet from my second question here, you are starting to run a higher cash balance and it\u2019s just relative to assets it\u2019s double what you have traditionally run. What do you intend to do there with this excess cash?", "William Mansfield", "Well, as we have talked to for a number of years now, our priorities in terms of what we do with our cash is that we have paid out increased dividends each year for the last 31 years. We do have internal growth initiatives that we need to fund with cash, as an example, historical example would be the branding initiative that we launched back in 2007. ", "Capital investment clearly is a factor. Acquisitions had been a part of Valspar strategy for a long time, they continue to be a part of our ongoing go forward strategy. And finally, share repurchase, which we have talked about that we will offset dilution and anything on or above that would be on an opportunistic basis, and that\u2019s fundamentally our prioritization for uses of cash.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Amy Zang - Goldman Sachs. ", "Amy Zang - Goldman Sach", "I have two questions. Bill, the first one is obviously over the past several quarters Valspar has benefited from this market share shift from the paint stores to the home centers. My question is, how long do you think this trend will last? Because, obviously, if the market has started to rebound more dramatically than people would expect, and then I would guess at some point, the trend will shift back in favor of the paint stores.", "William Mansfield", "Well, I think some of this, Amy, goes to our belief that there has been a fundamental change in the consumer economy. At 10 plus percent unemployment and projected to stay there for a while, quite candidly, I am not sure we see any basis to presume that the trend will shift back, we think consumers will stand under pressure for a long time on a go forward basis.", "Amy Zang - Goldman Sach", "Okay. And then the second question is, the incremental margins has been pretty strong for the coatings business. In the past two quarters, and obviously clearly reflecting the refreshing benefits. ", "Then the question is, what could be the timing, the question A is what could be timing for the coating demand turn around in 2010, and also what is the incremental margin for the coating business will it go higher or maybe we\u2019ll see some decline given, if the demand started to improve and I would imagine you will add back some cost.", "William Mansfield", "Well, to answer your first question A, when is the turn around and demand for the coating segment, unclear. That I think goes to the core of a little uncertainty that we have with respect to top-line in 2010. And number two, you are right, we have done a most of our restructuring in the coating segment and have benefited as a result. And we would expect to continue to see benefits and incremental margins throughout 2010.", "Amy Zang - Goldman Sach", "I think lastly, just to follow up, what would be the cost? I mean the expenses you will have to add back if volume demand started to improve in 2010?", "William Mansfield", "Very little, if any at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research. ", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Couple of questions, when you mentioned that you expect kind of a modest volume growth next year as part of your expectations, is that across all businesses including the challenged ones where you are seeing some stabilization, or do you expect primarily coatings and perhaps China and paints to be driving the growth in volumes while the incremental demand for some of your more challenged businesses remains not just weak but actually down year-over-year in 2010.", "William Mansfield", "No, it\u2019s pretty much across the board comment on the entire company Dmitry. I would hope we are not going to see another down year year-over-year in the \u201cchallenged\u201d businesses, I think they stabilized to the point where hopefully things can show some improvement next year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. So, I mean we have seen multiple years of declines in volume. So that\u2019s not the basis of your confidence, I think what you are saying is that you are seeing some stabilization here and you just can\u2019t imagine things getting worse.", "William Mansfield", "Yes, that\u2019s fundamentally it.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, all right great. Getting back to the pricing question. You do expect raw material to be a little bit of a headwind next year, currency is probably going to be neutral in margin, so there is not much you can do there assuming there is no great devaluation in any one region where you have to raise pricing to adjust for that. ", "How much pricing power do you think you have in terms of, both in the paints business and on the industrial coatings business, if raw materials resume their marches as, god forbid, but let\u2019s say oil goes back to over $100 a barrel and raw materials repeat what they did in 2008. ", "With lack of demand out there and with plenty of capacity even after you and your competitors have taken out some capacity, can we expect you to be able to keep up with raw materials even if it\u2019s trailing or are you in a situation where you basically are going to have to eat these costs no matter how high they get?", "William Mansfield", "That\u2019s a complicated question that has a complicated answer, I think if you recall on a historic basis, when we got hit with 20 plus percent raw material inflation back in the \u201805 period, it took 18 to 24 months to recover. ", "The last time though when again we faced this plus 20%, that cycle of time had been reduced probably to 9 to 12. And if the industry is faced with this extraordinary increase in raw material costs that I presume plus a $100 of barrel in crude oil would imply, there is only one answer to that challenge and that was the case in \u201807 and \u201808 and that was the case in \u201805 and \u201906, and so, I would expect that that same answer would emerge again, given that dire set of circumstances Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "I guess my only question is deference between this time and last time is there was demand and maybe some shortages in some areas whereas right now there is a lot of slack in the industry.", "William Mansfield", " ", "Yes and no, I would submit to you the last time through we were near two of the housing turn down in the U.S. So although there are, I\u2019ll grand you the point that there were strong pieces of demand, and certainly in our portfolio there were other pieces that were quite weak Dmitry in the same timeframe work.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. All right, that\u2019s right, thanks for reminding me of that. And then my final question, can you talk a little bit about your performance in China and your Huarun Paint. You mentioned you are spending some money and it looks like having increased promotional activity there to, as the business moves I\u2019m assuming into new geographies.", "William Mansfield", "Correct, and also if you remember in our third quarter call, we talked that we had some inventory corrections going on at our distributor level and they were putting programs in place and we were putting program in place. To get that inventory sold in the market place and some of what Lori talked about earlier on promotional spending, was a carry over of those programs to get the inventory moved to the consumer.", "Now, as an overall comment, we are pleased with our business in China, it\u2019s performed well this year, across the board it is the one place where we did see recovery in our sort of core general industrial and coil markets, but the only place where we really saw a recovery. So we are pleased with China overall and we are particularly pleased with the Huarun performance.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Then one final question, I apologize. If you look at your general industrial portfolio businesses and your outlook for 2010, which sectors of the industry or of your business do you have the most confidence in performance next year and which sectors do you think are still very difficult to call and things could be balancing along the bottom for quite sometime.", "William Mansfield", "Well, if you looked at our sort of, as we call it our industrial businesses or our coatings business, our packaging business has continued to perform well in 2009 and will on a go-forward basis. Still unclear to us in general industrial and our wood coatings business, and our coil business as you know is associated with new building construction and that has its own set of worries as we go into 2010.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Mike Hamilton - RBC.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "Just a little bit more color on industrial and coil specifically. Could you kind of walk through trend in fourth quarter, what you are absorbing there?", "William Mansfield", "Well, I would tell you that, we\u2019ll start with some smaller pieces on a global basis. Our China coil business recovered somewhat from the very depressed levels earlier in the year, earlier in 2009, but still is not up to what I would call the 2008 levels. ", "Our European business still is experiencing the impacts of the global downturn. We did talk in our third quarter in our U.S, or Americas coal business, that include Canada, the U.S and Mexico that we saw strengthen that surprised us. Though initially we thought it was as a result of some inventory build and that\u2019s probably still the case as to what occurred, and it\u2019s stayed not quite as strong but somewhat strong in the fourth quarter, but subsequent to that we have seen some signs that it\u2019s softening.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "Then final, would you care to hazard a shot at what type of volume pick up you have taken in market share here in recent times as we go into 2010?", "William Mansfield", "Since you have given me the choice of hazarding a guess I prefer not to and I\u2019m sure you understand why I might, thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen of the panel, I have no further questions in queue.", "William Mansfield", "Okay. Thank you everyone for your questions. Just to summarize, in \u201809, we delivered double digit earnings growth on a rather significant decline in sales which we believe is a clear indication of our operational discipline and our ability to execute.", "For \u2018010 we expect modest top-line growth due primarily to our new business efforts and share gains. We expect upward pressure on our raw material cost to continue and our 2010 results will benefit from carry over savings from our restructuring actions, our continued productivity improvement projects on our cost control. ", "We will continue to invest in our brands and in differentiated technologies and expect have another cash flow year. We are confident in our ability to deliver improved results in \u2018010 and currently expect our earnings, as we said, to be in the range of a $1.85 to $2.05 per share.", "Thanks for your time today and we will talk to you during our first quarter call in February.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude our conference call for today.

", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells. ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Thanks Joe. During the second quarter 2007, we completed the acquisition of M.A. Bruder & Sons Inc. Company headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Nitco Paints based in Mumbai, India. Although these acquisitions had some impact on sales during the quarter, they had little effect on profit by segment or consolidated. ", "Summarizing overall company performance for second quarter 2007 versus second quarter 2006, consolidated net sales increased 3.2% to $2.2 billion, reflecting improved domestic sales, architectural paints and industrial coatings and strong growth in mini markets outside the United States. The acquisitions of M.A. Bruder & Sons and Nitco Paints completed during the quarter increased consolidated sales by 0.7% in the quarter. ", "Consolidated gross profit increased $50 million for the quarter to $986.6 million and gross margin increased 90 basis points to 44.9% of sales. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased slightly to 30.3% of sales in the quarter from 30.1% last year, due primarily to our continued investment in new stores and increases in certain administrative costs. Interest expense, net of interest and investment income for the quarter was slightly higher at $13.1 million compared to $11 million last year, due to an increase in short-term borrowings. ", "Consolidated profit before taxes increased $34 million or 12.6% over the last year's second quarter to $303.1 million. The acquisitions had no significant impact on profit before taxes in the quarter. ", "Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.2% compared to 31.4% in the second quarter of '06. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year will be slightly higher than our '06 rate of 31%. ", "Consolidated net income for the quarter increased by $18 million or 9.8% to $202.6 million. Net income as a percentage of sales improved to 9.2% in the second quarter this year from 8.7% last year, due primarily to improved operations. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 14.3% to $1.52 per share compared to $1.33 per share in the second quarter 2006. ", "Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in second quarter 2007 increased 2.8% to $1.37 billion. Comparable store sales failed by stores opened more than 12 calendar months were flat in the quarter compared to second quarter last year. Sales growth for our Paint Stores was driven by improving architectural paint sales to do it yourself customers, commercial and residential repaint contractors, stronger industrial maintenance coating sales compared to the second quarter last year and one month of sales from M.A. Bruder & Sons. The M.A. Bruder acquisition increased Paint Stores Group sales by 1% in the quarter. ", "Regionally, in the second quarter 2007, our Eastern division led the sales perform followed by Midwest, Southwest and Southeast. All four divisions achieved stronger sales results in the quarter as compared to a year ago. Segment profit for the Group increased 9.7% to $238.2 million for the quarter, operating margin increased to 17.4% from 15.3% last year, due primarily to tight expense control and gross margins recovering to a more normalized range. ", "In the Consumer Group, for second quarter 2007, sales declined $4.3 million, a drop of 1.1% to $396.6 million. This was due primarily to continued soft DIY demand at most of the Group's retail customers. ", "Segment profit increased $6.3 million or 8.2% to $82.6 million in the quarter. Segment profit as a percent of net sales, our net external sales increased to 20.8% from 19.0% in the quarter last year, primarily due to tight spending control and improved manufacturing direct conversion cost. ", "Turning to our Global Group; for the second quarter 2007, net sales in U.S. dollars increased $35.5 million or 8.9% to $434.3 million. Stated in local currency, sales grew by 5.3% in the quarter, due primarily to a successful new product introduction in U.K. architectural and automotive paint volume gains in South America and improved product finishes sales in most markets. ", "The acquisition of Nitco Paints had most significant impact on sales of the Global Group in the quarter. Segment profit for the Global Group increased $14.8 million or 43.6% to $48.9 million for the quarter. Segment profit as a percentage of net sales, improved to 11.3% from 8.5% last year. This improvement was mostly attributable to increased sale, operating efficiencies related to increased volume and expense control. Currency exchange and the Nitco acquisition had no significant impact on operating profits. ", "I'd now like to comment briefly on some of our balance sheet items. Our total debt on June 30, 2007 was $757 million including total short-term borrowings of $455 million. This is down from $789 million at the end of second quarter 2006. Our cash balance at June 30, 2007 was $57.5 million compared to $248.6 million in 2006. Total borrowings to capitalization were 27.3% at the end of the quarter versus 28.6% at the end of the second quarter 2006. Long-term debt to capitalization was 13.0% at the end of the second quarter this year, compared to 20.6% last year. ", "In the second quarter 2007, the company purchased 1.3 million shares of our common stock in the open market. At June 30, 2007 we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately 88.2 million shares of the company's stock. ", "In second quarter 2007, we spent $44.8 million on capital expenditures. Depreciation expense was $33.3 million and amortization expense was $5.9 million. For the full year 2007, capital expenditures would be approximately $180 million. A significant share of these capital expenditures will go for investing in new stores, additional plant capacity and continued spending to upgrade our manufacturing facilities and replace plant and store equipments as necessary. ", "Depreciation will be about $130 million versus $123 million in 2006, and amortization expenses will be about $20 million versus $23 million in 2006. I'll conclude the review with the brief update on the status of our lead litigation. In Rhode Island, the case remain under appeal, both sides have now submitted candidates for our Court appointed special master to oversee the process of determining an abatement remedy. It is not clear how or when the selection of this special master will be made. ", "In Ohio, the city of Cincinnati has withdrawn its public nuisance lawsuit against former manufactures of lead pigment. Of the nine remaining municipal suits, three has been stayed along with the Ohio Attorney General suit, pending the Ohio Supreme Court's ruling on Senate Bill 117, a bill designed to clarify Ohio's product liability law. ", "In June, the state Supreme Court of Missouri and New Jersey upheld dismissal by lower courts in each state of the public nuisance lawsuit against former manufacturers of lead pigment. Finally, in Wisconsin, a 12-member jury in the city of Milwaukee's public nuisance lawsuit against NL Industries returned a verdict for the defendants, in a 10 to 2 vote, the jury found that although deteriorating lead pigment are building to the city may constitute a public nuisance, NL neither conspired to create it nor was negligent in creating it. ", "That concludes my review of the quarter, so I will turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the balance of the year. Chris? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Bob and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us today. You know on these calls I normally conclude my remarks by updating our guidance for the next quarter and full year. ", "This morning I'd like to begin with our expectations for third quarter and full year '07 because I think it will help to set the stage for my comments and the positive progress we've made in the first half and expect to make over the balance of the year. ", "In the third quarter, we expect our consolidated net sales to increase 4% to 6% over the third quarter of 2006. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income for common share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share, compared to $1.30 per share for the same quarter last year. ", "For the full year 2007, we expect sales to increase in the low single-digits over 2006. Based on that level of sales growth, we have raised our expectations for diluted net income per common share for the year to a range of $4.60 to $4.70 per share compared to $4.19 per share last year. This change in our outlook for the year is a reflection of both the strength of our results in the first half and our confidence that we are well positioned to manage the challenges that lie ahead in the third quarter and beyond. ", "The second quarter of 2007 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams in many ways. We achieved record sales, earnings and cash flow for the quarter, completed two strategically important acquisitions, expanded our controlled distribution platform domestically and abroad and purchased 1.3 million shares of our stock on the open market. These accomplishments strengthen both our financial position and our competitive position. ", "We take the moment to comment on our acquisition of M.A. Bruder & Sons and Nitco Paints. You know, we often talk about our interest in acquiring companies that add to our controlled distribution and platform, provide us with a highly differentiated product and brands or expand our presence outside of North America and by these criteria, M.A. Bruder and Nitco Paints are right in our warehouse, solid businesses with great talent, well known in respected brands and great potential synergies for our company. M.A. Bruder services professional painting contractors, loaders and do-it-yourself customers in the Eastern, Midwestern and Southeastern United States through 131 company on paint stores and 80 sales territories. These stores and territories will significantly enhance our ability to serve professional painters and do-it-yourself customers in these important regions of the country and the process of integrating them with our existing stores organization has already begun. ", "Nitco Paints is a leading manufacturer and distributor of exterior specialty paints and coatings headquartered in Mumbai, India. Although, a relatively small in total revenues today, Nitco will provide us with the platform in which to grow our presence in the dynamic and growing Indian market. ", "I am confident these two organizations will contribute to our profitable growth for years to come. Although as Bob has commented, neither will have an impact on segment process or PGG in 2007. ", "During the second quarter, our Paint Stores segment opened 13 net new stores, bringing the total net new stores for the first half of the year to 30. At this pace, we remain on track to open around 100 net new stores during the year. Our commitment to control distribution as we planned it in the past extends beyond North America. ", "Our Global Group additionally opened nine new stores and branches during the quarter including the 131 MAB stores reopened or acquired, the total of 153 stores during the second quarter and that brings our year-to-date total to 180 additional stores. Now there is some truth to the old saying that what goes inside makes you stronger. So we are facing a difficult sales environment and we have been facing it for the past three or four quarters particularly in the new residential market. This is required as the focus our efforts on our other growth opportunities in order to generate continued strong results. While we remain focused on driving top line growth getting more of those revenue dollars to the bottom line was one of the key towards success in the second quarter. ", "We achieved year-over-year double-digit increases in profit before tax and earnings per share despite a slight increase in our SG&A expense and a near double-digit increase in net income for the quarter even after a 180 basis point increase in our effective tax rate. Our consolidated growth margin increased by 90 basis points in the quarter and a 120 basis points for the first half and all three segments posted operating margin increases of more than 100 basis points for the quarter. ", "We made good stride in recovering gross margin over the first half of '07. However, we expect our consolidated gross margin for the year to be remain below the historical levels we achieved back in 2003. We continue to make progress in our management and working capital in the second quarter strongest reported in our company. Although our working capital ratio, accounts receivable plus inventories less payable to 12 month sales increased to 14.1% for the quarter compared to 13.9% for the second quarter of '06. The acquisition of M.A. Bruder and Nitco Paints inflated this ratio by one half of 1% of sales. ", "During the quarter, we generated $358.8 million in cash from operations compared to $302.4 million for the same period last year, an increase of more than $46 million in cash. This combination of earnings improvement in the quarter and reduced investment of working capital accounted for the increase. ", "Finally, yesterday our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.315 per share, up from $0.25 per share last year, continuing our longstanding record of paying out 30% of prior year's earning per share. ", "Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now we will be happy to take your questions. ", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jeff Zekauskas with J.P. Morgan. Please state your question. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. This is Selka Cook [ph] for Jeff. How are you? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Selka. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Two questions; when you look at the improvement in the gross margins, how much came from reduction in direct labor cost, how much came from higher prices and mix and how much came from the material cost? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "I would tell you that let's take a look at it, price was the majority of it, let me tell you that the raw materials are very minor amounts and the direct labor is minor also, but the majority of it came from price. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And secondly, can you discuss what happened in the professional and paint markets in the quarter and it just looked, they looked softer sequentially and year-over-year and similarly PBT commented that it reported lower volumes in the professional channels as well? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "I think Selka as we've commented in the past, the impact of the new residential housing markets slow down has impacted the professional painting contractors in that segment. Positively, they have been somewhat offset by strength in some performance growth in the other professional painting contractor segment that we participate in; residential repaint, property management, commercial and industrial. So the exception in that one area in new residential, we see a continued improvement in the professional painting contractor segment that we service. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks very much ", "Operator", "The next question is from Armando Lopez with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. ", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good Morning everyone. ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Hey Armando. ", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Couple of questions, I was just wondering if you guys can talk a little bit more about the margin and how you are thinking about the margin going forward? You've done a good job of controlling SG&A cost. If you can maybe talk a little bit about where the savings coming from and just so we can get an understanding of what you think of normalized earnings margin, normalized margin for the company? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Armando, if you take a look at our gross margin, for the quarter, we have 44.9%, for the year-to-date we are about 45%. Last year, we were about 43.8% year-to-date through the first six months of '06. We finished last year right around 43.7%, right now we believe our margin will be at or slightly below where we are for the first six months of this year also. So, that should give you a pretty good indication where we think our margin. Long term, I think we've shared just with most people, when you look back at as Chris mentioned, historic heights in 2003 which was above 45% and we've... from 2003 we've had back-to-back raw material increases. We believe overtime that our goal is that we can get above that 45.4% that we had in 2003. We don't believe we are going to ... but I think we've already told you here; what we think we are going to be able to do this year. ", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Alright. ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "When you take a look at the SG&A and we really look at where we were in the quarter, we were up 2.10, the 30.3, the 30.1, year-to-date we are up about 7.10. So, when you take a look at that margin improvement in the second quarter which was 7.10, that was pretty good. We think that's on a high side for the year, but when we think that we... when you look at the part-time hours, they are well under control. Again some of the black belt for taking a look at the tens usage and how we use ten and the controlling of hours at our stores as well as freight. Well, that's the things that they are controlling our SG&A, we've been working on those for years. When you take a look at that for the remainder of the year, that SG&A increase, we think our SG&A is going to go up as a percent of sales because of sales. When you... at the lower single-digits, we've always talked that we need 4% or 5% after the new stores to get leverage on our SG&A. So, when you take a look at it, the second half of the year, we will have a full six months of the MAB 131 stores and so forth. So, when we look at our margins, second quarter was very strong with 70 basis points increase. We don't see that increase in third and fourth quarter, but for the full year we are going to have a nice increase on our operating margin. ", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then just as you think about getting back to the historical heights in like ''03, is that coming from just improved efficiencies or pricing, like --? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "I would say that when you take a look at the margin this year and I answered part of it... the majority of that margin increases is price. When you think of it where we were at 2003 from 2002, it was really the increased gallons for our plants and a lot of efficiencies there and I think that's what is going to drives us from 44.9% to 45% this year up to the 45.5% plus over the next couple of years. ", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, thanks. ", "Operator", "Next question is from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company. Please state your question. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Good morning, ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Hi Eric. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Couple of things; first of all, in terms of sales momentum, it seems like you are guiding for better growth in 3Q than 2Q, and I know the acquisitions are also having perhaps more of an influence in 3Q. But can you talk about the momentum of comps through 2Q and what you are thinking about 3Q relative to that? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think couple of things, are impacting that Eric. First of all, the second half of this year has more favorable comparisons. As you recall, in '06 we had a phenomenal first quarter, a very strong second quarter and then the year ended flat not a little bit in the back half. So, we are going up against those numbers. Now, the performance trend that we have been eyeing for the first half of the year, I don't think we see it accelerating as much as we are coming into little better comparison. Certainly all the news of the industry regarding housing starts etcetera wouldn't give us any indication that that's going to pick up at all. So, it's more comparison issue for us going forward. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. Secondly, within the increased guidance and the increased performance in the 2Q in the second half, is it entirely margin and entirely... I guess what's been different rather than answering the question for you, what's been different than what you expect and this allowed you to have such offset earnings performance? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think there is, all the areas that make that up in terms of margins, SG&A etcetera that had impact but Sean, why don't you guys talk to it? ", "Sean P. Hennessy - Senior Vice President - Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "When you take a look at where we were at the end of first quarter, Eric, versus our full year forecast, our margin is not maturely different than we thought that would be. I think that the SG&A control was a little stronger in the second quarter and our forecast in the SG&A control a little stronger in the third and fourth quarter than what we did in the first quarter. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then just lastly Chris, can you just talk a bit about your acquisition strategy and I think you commented at the outset of looking for acquisitions that broaden your exposure internationally. Can you just flush that out a little bit more of what you are thinking about? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I think we have been consistent here for some time now on the three formats that we look to expand and Nitco is a great example of that in a market with significant GDP growth, emerging professional painting contracting communities and opportunity with great starting point to build a platform going forward. We have built that globally throughout Latin America over the many decades and I think we've indicated an interest a little more aggressively into the growing markets of the world going forward. ", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Great, thanks. ", "Operator", "The next question is from John Roberts with Buckingham Research. Please state your question. ", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "Good morning guys. ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning John. ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Good morning. ", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "The upside was driven largely by cross management and I would expect you'll second as you continue into the second half you don't seem to be increasing the second half earnings by more than just the upside in the second quarter. So, are you expecting it to be more offset in the second half by some additional deterioration maybe in the market? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "No, I think when you take a look at... when you compare the first half, the first half of the year we had $0.18 EPS improvement with our guidance between $4.60 and $4.70, we have $0.41 to $0.51 increase over the $4.19 last year. So basically saying that we are going to improve $0.23, I am sorry, yes $0.23 to $0.33 versus $0.18 from the first half. I think that... as I've said, I think the second quarter, the SG&A up 20 basis points versus the margin up 90 basis points, that's seven-tenth. We don't believe that we will hit that seven-tenth the third and fourth quarter, but we still believe that we are going to earn more in... we are going to flow through more EPS improvement in the second half year than the first half. ", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "Secondly, as you annualize the loss business at the major retailer, should we expect that sales will turn up now in the consumer segment? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "No. I think we've been giving guidance that we expect that segment to be flat or down slightly going forward. As you comment we are annualizing now the loss of the few of those distribution facilities at major retailer, but this is not an area that we think will change dramatically going forward. ", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "I guess PPG reported this morning and they had pretty good sales in the mass merchandiser channel, I think, I was... surprisingly in that channel? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "They are primarily servicing one retailer and that retailer is doing better than the rest. ", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "Okay. Alright, thank you. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Saul Ludwig with Keybanc. Please state your question. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Good morning guys, ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Good morning Saul. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "I was trying my best in the past about this administrative line where you have the $56 million of expense. I mean you choreographed on that your interest expense, your interest and other income and your other; it leaves you with a number that was like $50 million of expense in administration versus only $32 million last year. I think in the first quarter you said there were some special items that boosted administrative cost and they were going to level out. What caused this increase in administrative cost and the administrative line segment? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "As you saw, it's pretty much the same answer as the first quarter and I'll just... in the first quarter, we're at... in the first quarter we had $50 million versus $40 million, this quarter we have $66 million versus $58 million. In the... again, it's really the, I would say the spreading of some benefit cost and the benefit cost in the second quarter were up $7.6 million, year-to-date that's $12 million. So it's, the change from $58 million to $66 million was up $8 million and the balance that was up $7.6 million and for the full year was up $12 million of benefits and were up $18 million. So, when you look at the year-to-date, let me go to third quarter, third quarter we were at $53 million last year with the head and the first quarter went up to $78 million and for the full year with $230 million. I think that, I didn't mean to imply that it was only the first quarter. There is... I would say that some of the cost where we saw in the fourth quarter is now been recognized in a different quarter. So, when you take a look at it, we still believe for the full year that this segment will be up by inflation. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Even though we have had the big increases thus far, and you also have a benefit $5 million less environmental cost, you have $6 million favorable swing in FX. So, there was $11 million of help from those two items that are additional expenses that you incurred over and above what you related to the benefit cost? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Right. Just all foreign exchanges is not off recorded in the admin section. I know some of it goes actually to the global group into but I am not sure exactly how that breaks out between the two. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Okay. Next question, in the stores, we got zero comp store sales which we kind of expected. Will that be a maybe 3% prize and minus 3% volume? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Not that strong. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "What was that? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's not that strong. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "What might be the right answer? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "It's less than 3% sales and less than 3% volume decline. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Okay. And how much did you spend in the quarter on the two acquisitions and on the share buyback. What was the numbers for both? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "The amount that we spend on acquisitions was $149 million and share buyback, I will tell you in some seconds there. Well, that's year-to-date is $309 million that we spend on share buyback for the first... but in the second quarter. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "I'd back it that out. ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Okay thanks. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Okay. And then finally, the results in the Global Group were pretty impressive and when you think about the Global Group being comprised this year foreign stores, your auto refinished and your OEM, non-automotive coatings. Could you talk little about those three buckets within Global and who are the driver were, in not only at the revenue growth but more importantly, the profit growth? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think all three of those operating teams inside that segment for us all had a good quarter for us. We have been on a pretty consistent performance stretch now for a number of years, driven by new management teams, new product introductions, some slight acquisitions helped in the past and I would say, it's been pretty evenly divided among the three of them in terms of both sales and profit contributions of the segment's performance. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "And then finally, you saw PPG's announcement on SigmaKalon. Was this the property that you were interested, and is that the price was too high or was it strategically not of interest to you guys? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we did participate as many as the press releases indicated in the process. As you know, from following us so, we follow a very disciplined approach to determining valuation for our shareholders and we can't really comment on PPG's approach to that and we will just see how it all shapes out. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank a lot. ", "Operator", "The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with J. P. Morgan. Please state your question. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Yes, it's a follow-up. The... when should the MAB acquisition be accretive and that if not, I would have expected it to be accretive this year already. ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Yes, I would say that in 2008 it will be accretive. It's when you reasonably say that it's, really going to mean, not of material effect. We are doing some integration. When you take a look at the integration costs dealing with some systems work that we are doing... doing the integration; just the timing, if some of that's going to occur this year, and then those expenses will go in, then the next year will be accretive. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Alright. And there is one other question; there is a significant reduction in other income and a large improvement, or I guess like a significant reduction in other expense and a large improvement in other income year-over-year. What are those changes and are there any gains from asset sales or anything in that? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "Selka, most of the change in other income and expenses due to the foreign currency exchange gains and losses that are on that line. We have significant gains this year as opposed to the FX losses in 2006, there is very little gains on sale of fixed assets. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "And maybe a last question on the SigmaKalon acquisition. Do you expect the combined SIGMA PPG entity to create more competitive pressure in any region like marine, coatings or any where else or do you think there are actually some opportunities on that as they try to integrate it? ", "Christopher M. Connor - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer", "The competitive reaction will be interesting to watch as it unfolds. Obviously we have very little presence in these markets today, so PPG's potential ownership would then go on forward, we don't think has much impact at all on our structure whether or not they will build out a better global marine platform, again this remains to be seen. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks very much. ", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]. The next question is from Saul Ludwig with Keybanc. Please state your question. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Follow-up on the FX, where it's included? When you were discussing the segments and Bob Wells was going over those, he talked about that none of those segments had any benefit from FX. So, that's why I assume that the big positive swing in the FX would have all be in the admin line. So, if it's not in the admin line, what is the global segment that's benefited by this $6 million favorable swing in FX? ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Saul, when we look at our FX category on the other income expense, that's one major of the amount that's in PBT. There's a foreign currency effect throughout the P&L on sales, margins and SG&A. So, when we talk about the total effect on PBT there's little net effect on PBT although any one single line could be larger. ", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments. ", "Robert J. Wells - Vice President - Corporate Communications and Public Affairs", "Thank you very much Joe.

Please go ahead with your question.", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning Armando.", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Just a couple of quick questions, I guess first on the CapExcoming in lower than expected, could you maybe just talk a little bit moreabout what the variance around that is?", "And then second, in terms of the full year guidance of $4.70to $4.75 that seems like it would imply $0.80 to $0.85 fourth quarter, whichwould suggest a slowdown in the margin acceleration from the second and thirdquarter, if you could just talk a little bit about that?", "Chris Connor", "Why don't I ask, Sean Hennessy to comment on our Cap Exnumber. Sean.", "Sean Hennessy", "When you take a look at Cap Ex, Armando. We had a fewprojects that we were planning in land purchases that we've pushed out and oncapacity and that's really the main reason why our Cap Ex is going to be alittle lower this year.", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So will that show up, then, next year? Or is it justlike postponing it a year?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, I think, that is as we watch the volume as we take alook at those things. Eventually they will spend that money, but we don'tthink, we didn't want to spend the money before we really needed to.", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Okay.", "Chris Connor", "And on the margin compression, I guess, $80 to $85, we'reseeing at $4.70 to $4.75. I think when you take a look at a lot of differentthings that are moving around in that quarter, I think our segments will be alittle compressed in one or two of the segments. But I think, for the full yearwe're going to show nice margin improvement in the three segments.", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And thenjust one last one, in terms of the 30 million authorization for the buyback.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Is there a timeframe that you're expecting to work through?", "Chris Connor", "No, I don't think so. As we\u2019ve said, this is consistent withour practice. Two years ago we received 20 million authorization from theboard, two years before that 20 million authorization. So this is just part ofour normal policy using excess cash to be opportunistic in the market.", "Armando Lopez - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks a lot. Nice quarter, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Armando.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from P.J. Juvekar withCitiGroup. Please state your question.", "Anthony Petaneri - CitiGroup", "Hi, this is Anthony standing in for P. J.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Anthony.", "Anthony Petaneri - CitiGroup", "Good morning. After looking at results from value spar andPPGX, so we've had a lot about residential weakness creeping into commercialconstruction and industrial order books. Could you comment on any deteriorationor softness you're seeing on industrial end markets?", "Chris Connor", "Sure, we\u2019ll be happy to. Our commercial and industrialactivity held up well in the third quarter. Fairly consistent with the samebuying levels that we've seen throughout the calendar year 2007. Kind of salesand earnings guidance that we've given for the fourth quarter assumes that samekind of market performance going into the fourth quarter.", "We would comment that for the industry, in calendar year2006, these commercial industrial markets were growing more robustly perhaps inthe double-digit range. And they have slowed down in '07. You know, theindustry forecasting, perhaps, even a little slower in '08.", "But we continue to believe this will be a positive segmentfor our company and we expect to make progress here.", "Anthony Petaneri - CitiGroup", "Great. Great. And just following up, I mean, when you lookat the industrial end markets, if you look at auto or marine are theresub-segments where you're seeing particular strength or particular weakness? Oris it\u2026?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. Anthony, I think that probably the strongest segmentthat we\u2019re seeing is in industrial maintenance coatings. Not any particular enduser segment, but in general the protective finishes for Steel And Concretehave been very strong.", "Anthony Petaneri - CitiGroup", "Okay. Great.

Please state your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland ResearchCompany", "Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland ResearchCompany", "Two questions. First of all, from a bigger pictureperspective, because when you came into the year you talked, I guess relativeto the beginning of the year you're going to end up earning $0.10 or $0.15 moreon sales there probably 4 or 5 points lower than what you had planned cominginto the year. Can you just explain, how you're making more money with weakersales?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. Eric, I think, part of the processes that we gothrough here with our management teams are to react to the markets environmentthat we face. And if you look at our SG&A expense.", "Particularly, we're really proud of the job our team hasdone to get that in line to see a lot of this slowing come ahead of time andpulled in. And the margin performance has also been strong for the company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland ResearchCompany", "Within the gross margin performance, which you've done agood job on all year, is there anything you highlight that you've been able toaccomplish within that year during the year to create that upside?", "Chris Connor", "Well, the two inputs to gross margin, both played a rolehere. First, pricing, and our ability through our controlled distributionplatform to get the necessary pricing over time has been indicated over thelast several years I think our team did a nice job, did well this year. And inthe raw materials input cost while we think for the industry is going to be upagain this year, year-over-year.", "We would comment on our team's job in managing through thatas best as possible. So, on both sides of that, we've been able to make someprogress this year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland ResearchCompany", "And second question on the raw material issue. Clearly those(inaudible) in the last 30 or 60 days, the world is changing. Can you commentabout what your expectation is in terms of the industry's raw material costgrowth this year and sort of how you're thinking about positioning the businessin light of that as we move towards 2008?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. I think the raw material input for calendar '07 andthe third quarter, we saw continued to go up probably another 1 to 2% for theindustry. And I think we're moving our guidance up a little bit. We had talkedabout it being in the low single digits, maybe flat to up to 3%.", "It's our opinion now that the industry would see around 2 to4% raw material cost increase for this calendar year '08, it's a little earlyfor us Eric, yet to give guidance or pulling all those numbers together andwe'll be happy to comment on that on our first quarter call", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland ResearchCompany", "And then just last, you commented earlier about commercial,but can you talk about the momentum of the business, September, October,indicated a commercial may be a little slower. But are you seeing things getbetter, get worse, stay the same? Can you give us a little sense on it?", "Chris Connor", "No. Guidance were given for the quarter for sales in the midsingle digit range, which will be slightly better than what we've been able todo this year. It's been built pretty much the way that our years come togetherwith the Stars Group performing in the mid single digits and our global alittle bit higher and our consumer segment flattish.", "And the role that the commercial, industrial accounts areplaying in that store's business particularly, have been consistent. So, Iwould say there's really no significant change in the direction of what we'reseeing from our revenue.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland ResearchCompany", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with FTN MidwestSecurities. Please state your question. I'm sorry; the question is from PeterThompson with Coho Partners. Please state your questions", "Peter Thompson - Coho Partners", "I\u2019m sorry. I just had a one quick one for you if it ispossible. Can you say how much you spent on the 5.5 million shares you bought?", "Chris Connor", "Sure, Sean -- but in the \u2026", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, the average price was $67, spent approximately $360million.", "Peter Thompson - Coho Partners", "Okay. Can I just ask you one strategic question just on your-- on the Global Group? Could you just comment on kind of where you guys,you\u2019re thinking that's going over the like three to five years?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, I think the Global Group will continue to be a strongdriver for us.

One for you, before I\u2019m going for Sean, andlooking at the DIY demand trends. They seem to be better the stores in thequarter than in the consumer group, any particular reason for that?", "Chris Connor", "Not particularly. Our retailing partners from our consumergroup pretty much across the Board were feeling some weakness out the door. Ithink that's been borne out by their comments and their calls and releases. Ourstore's business continues to really focus on the high-end DIY customer andable to make some marginal improvements there.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest", "So, it sounds like it might be consumer segmentation here,quality versus price.", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. I don't know that I'd go that far. These areparticularly from our store standpoint; it's not a big segment of what happensthere? Was just we had a good quarter.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest", "Okay. Sean, if we're looking at the $0.02 that acquisitionscost earnings in the quarter. How would you break that down that operatinglosses or financing costs offsetting out and profits from the acquiredcompanies?", "Sean Hennessy", "I would say 100% operating. As, we have come through, wehaven't completed our synergies and some of the expenses, we've had during theintegration sales, but I would say it's 100 operations.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest", "When do you think that will flip into the positive?", "Chris Connor", "I think, second quarter, probably around second quarter ofnext year.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest", "So that will be more or less a slight drag until then?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest", "All right. Thank you. Great quarter.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Chuck.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Jeff Zekauskas withJPMorgan. Please state your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "This quarter our year sales grew about 30.8% and you'retalking about 5 to 6% sales growth in the fourth quarter. Where is theacceleration coming? Where is the extra two percentage points of growth comingfrom and why?", "Chris Connor", "Well, I think, as we commented at the beginning of the year,Jeff. We knew, if the year went on, we have a little bit easier comparables sothat\u2019s playing somewhat of a role here given the fourth quarter then we hadlast year.", "Beyond that, I think that, the strength that we've seen inparticularly the paint stores group and global group continues to give usconfidence that we're going to get these numbers.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "How much was your gallon went up this quarter or for theyear, excluding acquisitions?", "Chris Connor", "For the store's group, which is the best place for us tocomment on gallons, we were negative low-single digits in the quarter ongallons. And that's been fairly consistent for the year.", "Consumer with negative sales would have been a little bitmore backwards in gallon performance in global group had a probably mid-singledigit gallon volume improvement.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "As first Rhode Island goes, so if it turns out that RhodeIsland determines Sherwin-Williams share of abatement cost is I don't know,$800 million? Are we going to see an $800 million cash outflow at a point intime? Or is that not the way to look at it?", "Chris Connor", "That's way too early to make an assumption regarding, whatthis abatement, if it ever comes to that settlement will look like.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "I mean, assuming that that were the number. Is that the wayit would affect Sherwin-Williams funds flow statement that way or would it not?", "Chris Connor", "Well, the other issue that's unknown to us, at this time,Jeff, is what is the timing mechanism of what an abatement order might looklike in the future. So, if that were spread over a ten-year period or afive-year period, if other parties were brought into it. I just think, it'svery too speculative at this point to comment on that.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Lastly, in terms of raw materials, you spoke about theindustry being up 2 to 4%. I don\u2019t know, it looked like TiO2 prices were downabout 10% and even acrylics were probably down in the first half as well.", "Do you think, raw materials are not really moving up thatfast? Or how do you get 2 to 4% increase?", "Chris Connor", "Jeff, maybe you would like to accept the position as ourChief raw materials procurement agent, if you see a price like that.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "That's terrific.", "Chris Connor", "There is a lot of different components that go into thebasket of raw\u2019s. And certainly, we've seen a pressure this year on the oilderivatives products, their packaging costs, demand for natural gas and energycomponents wherever that factors through has created some input.", "So all in, this is the trend that we've been seeing allyear. And as we've gone in the fourth quarter with oil up over into the mid andhigh 80s and even bumping against 90, this is what, we think is going tohappen.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from Saul Ludwig withKeyBanc. Please state your question.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "All right. Good morning, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "A lot of companies are complaining about distribution costand high fuel costs. How bigger deal is that as you ship this heavy materialall over the country?", "Chris Connor", "Well, Saul. A couple of things. It has negatively affectedus and it has increased our cost of goods sold. We've put it through and youcan see, what happened to our margin. But, also the last couple of years we'vehedged our gasoline purchases for our fleet.", "And those hedges have really helped us in the last -- in thefirst three quarters of this year. ", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Is this going to be a problem going forward as your hedgesroll over?", "Chris Connor", "No, because we've layered them. We have layers and we havesome that go out timing wise very well for us.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay. Great. How much did you spend for acquisitions in thethird quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "We spent $99 million in the third quarter and make us year-to-date $248 millionyear-to-date.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "How do these businesses lose money? When you don't have toamortize any goodwill, you must to have paid some enormous multiple of EBITDAfor them to be diluted. I'm just trying to figure out how you\u2019re actually havedilution on an acquisition these days?", "Sean Hennessy", "Well, I think, Saul, when you sit there and take a look attaking care of the customer first, I think that both -- one of this -- onemajor acquisition we did this year was, I'd say, tight on SG&A at the storelevel and taking care of it. Just with timing, putting in some SG&A and soforth. But in the long run, it will be creative in the first full year we haveit.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay. Sean, I can't help but ask about the administrativecost line. We'd be disappointed if you didn't.", "Sean Hennessy", "Saul, I'll tell you right now, if you will take a look atit, if you take a look at the line for the quarter we're at $66 million versus$53, which is up about $53 million. Really, let me tell you three factors thatcaused that to be a little higher than last year.", "We had a $12.5 million environmental provision we took inthe quarter. So, that was in that. Our interest expense was up about $4.7million. That's a little over $17 million. We also sold an asset. We sold thethird jet that we have, and we had a $6 million gain. So, when you put thosethree together between the interest and the environmental and the jet, it'sabout $11 million hit.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "You had another $5million gain. Did you have an $11 milliongain on asset of that?", "Sean Hennessy", "Right, $5million was in the store's operating segment ofthere was a piece of property from one of the acquisitions we've done a fewyears ago and so that other gain was in the store's operating segment.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Oh, that wasn't down in other income?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, it wasn't?", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Within the in the stores so that side of margin of thestores to some degree.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. That helped the margin in the stores, yes.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay. And as we look to the fourth quarter, do we seeadministrative flattening out?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. I think you're going to see flattening outyear-to-date, when you take a look at the $31 million, I know last year-to-dateI talked about benefits costing $14 million and environmental and interestexpense. But For the full year we do see that flattening out (inaudible) Forthe fourth quarter, not the full year? Yes, the fourth quarter\u2026", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "All Right. Then also last year in the fourth quarter you hadonly a 22% tax rate. You also had a $16 million legal expense settlement, whichI assume won't reappear. But the tax rate, is this part of the reason in thisyear looking for 33% tax rate, last year a 22% tax rate. Is that an issue inthe lower rate of earnings per share growth?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. If you take a look at it for the full year and thisquarter, as Bob mentioned, our tax rate was in the 31 versus 35. In the firstquarter it flipped the other way. For the full year we feel it will bemarginally higher than last year. You're right, in the fourth quarter we'regoing to have to go over that 22% tax rate.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Was the $16 million legal expense that you had last year,was that fully taxed? I mean, you got a tax benefit on that?", "Sean Hennessy", "Not fully, but on the majority of it, yes.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay. And I guess, Chris, you say in the stores relative tothe down 6% of comp store sales, it was write down 2 5% in volume, which wouldapply up 1.9% in price, something like that?", "Sean Hennessy", "Directly in that's close", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay.

Please stateyour question.", "Greg Goodney - UBS", "High, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Hi Greg.", "Greg Goodney - UBS", "The revenue for store on your acquisition is that part ofthe issue that the stores were slightly dilutive to earnings? Do you expect toget the revenues up to your average, which is, what about a 1.5 million bucks astore? And when would do you that?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. I don't think the revenue impact at the acquisitionswas part of the operating losses Sean, was commenting on. Our expectations arethat these stores will start to perform closer to our levels in every way. Andit probably takes you around two to three years to get to that run rate.", "Greg Goodney - UBS", "Okay. How much of a GAAP is there now?", "Chris Connor", "We wouldn't comment on that.", "Greg Goodney - UBS", "Okay. Next question. What's next on the M&A front? Isthat going to be it for a while or do you have more things planned?", "Chris Connor", "Of course we have more things planned. Time will tellwhether we're successful with any of them.", "Greg Goodney - UBS", "So I shouldn't necessarily assume that M&A is going tominimal and that cash would be used exclusively for share buyback, then.", "Chris Connor", "I think you can expect us for the remainder of the year aswell as into '08 and beyond we continue to use cash consistent with the way wehave been and we can find a creative acquisitions kind of in the size rangethat we're doing, we're going to make them.", "Greg Goodney - UBS", "Okay.

I was wondering on the lawsuit or the trial and withWisconsin (ph) that you mentioned its will probably be finished by November, isthat can you just give us a little bit more background on what the potentialoutcomes \u2013 outcome for that could be in sort of the down sides now?", "In other words, I guess if you lost, is that a punitivedamage situation? Or is it a class action status?", "You know and what would you need to appeal? Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Well Tim, I can't comment prospectively on what the damagesmight be. The suit is a personal injury lawsuit and it is a minor child whoallegedly was affected by ingesting led paint when he was a young child.", "And Wisconsin has a somewhat unique interpretation by theirSupreme Court pertaining to risk contribution theory of liability, which is whythis suit is being was brought in Wisconsin but, it is not a class action suit.It is a loan (inaudible) and the pretty straightforward suit in terms ofpersonal injury complaint.", "Tim Isaac - Bear Stearns", "Okay great and are they alleging a certain amount or is itkind of just is there like a dollar amount they are putting on at this point?", "Chris Connor", "I don't believe there is. The plaintiff already made arecovery against the property owner.", "Tim Isaac - Bear Stearns", "Okay.", "Chris Connor", "Okay so it is time to go after somewhat you're saying?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Tim Isaac - Bear Stearns", "Okay. Thank you very much. Congratulations on your quarter.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Next question is from Robert Follis,Gabelli & Company. Please state your question.", "Robert Follis - Gabelli & Company", "Hi, guys. Most of my questions have been answered just acouple of quick ones. I guess first if I look at the operating income marginsfor the first three quarters really the highest level you see and ", "probably the last five, six, seven years.", "So, just a couple of questions around that I guess firstly,how much of the improvement", "this year would you attribute to I guess operatingefficiencies, cost controls versus pricing above and beyond raw material costinflation?", "Chris Connor", "I would tell you the we were completed, I wanted to jump inthere to answer, but hopefully you completed your question. But when you sitthere and take a look at our P&L and if you go right down to P&L, ourmargin is up 45 versus 44 year-to-date.", "The margin expansion that we've had compared to last year isreally first and foremost, that margin. Secondly as Chris mentioned earlierwhen Eric had that question, our SG&A is only up 4 times we've have beentwo straight quarters or SG&A as percent of sales went down.", "When you think about the amount of new stores andacquisitions and so forth and so, that's really goes back to your efficiencies.And I think that for this year, margin is probably 60%, the efficiency is 40.If you look at the long-term and say, okay, now let's look over to five, six,seven years, our gross margin, that 45 year-to-date is back toward the high endof where we were four", "years ago.", "I'd say 90% of what the margin expansion has really beenefficiencies and sales increases.", "Robert Follis - Gabelli & Company", "So, would you say that despite what could potentially be anup tick in raw materials as heading to the fourth quarter into 2008, that you'dbe able to at least sustain current margins and then also, as you look as youlook out over the next three or five years. What do you see as the ceiling forthe margins?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, I think if you look at the short-term, and if we wereto have a raw material increase in calendar year '08, if we were able tomaintain margins, our history, Robert, would indicate that perhaps for aquarter or two or longer, depending on the severity of the increase, we seemargin pressure. But over a period of time we're able to get pricing in themarket and recover those margins.", "And over a longer historical period, what we've done, aswe've gone through each of these cycles, as we've come out of it, we've gottenback to our previous high watermark and then actually been able to make alittle progress beyond that.", "Kind of the way we think about running the company as we goforward is we would expect over time, with operating efficiencies and continuedhard work that we can keep driving these margins perhaps 10 to 20 basis pointsa year so. There is no upward limit that we've ever established on what we canaccomplish here.", "Robert Follis - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. So as I look to '08, perhaps some pressure, a littlebit of pressure if raw tick up further. Hopefully you'll make that up as you goalong.", "Chris Connor", "To you and all the listeners, when we next get together onthe fourth quarter and full year conference call, which will be in the firstquarter of '08, we'll give you all that thinking in terms of what we expect tohappen to raws and how we'll manage to get through that.", "Robert Follis - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And then I guess lastly, you've done a great job inthe last three quarters controlling SG&A and bringing you down as a percentof sales. Is this sustainable? As we look forward, do you think you canmaintain this level?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. I think it's one of the hallmarks of the company. Ifyou think about it, a significant portion of our SG&A resides in our storeorganization, with 3200 stores. So the ability to manage that, to flex it whennecessary, and, again historically if you look back over periods, this has justbeen something the company has developed a habit and discipline in doing.", "So, our expectation going forward is that we will be in thatrange. It may go backwards 10 to 20 basis points, in a given period. But overtime and sustainable we would expect to be in that period or slightly better.", "Robert Follis - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Thanks for the help.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you. The next question is from Saul Ludwig withKeyBanc. Please state your question.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Just a follow-up on this, the environmental costs which wereso much in the third quarter. As we look to fourth quarter, I don't know, eveninternally how you guys budget that number, but you've got to think about it, Iguess, and make a shot.", "Last year you had $6 million in environmental cost in thefourth quarter, year before you had $12.5 million. How should we think aboutthe fourth quarter, recognizing that it may be a mushy number?", "Chris Connor", "I think it will be lower than last year. Okay. Thank youvery much.", "Operator", "I'm sorry, there are no questions in queue. I'd like to turnit back over to management for closing comments.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, Joe. I will be available all afternoon to answerany follow-up questions you have. I look forward to taking your calls.

At this time, all participants are in alisten-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder,this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, PaulReyelts. Please, go ahead.", "Paul Reyelts", "Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our year-end EarningsCall. Today, we will be covering results for the fourth quarter and the fullyear. Bill Mansfield and Lori Walker are with me on our call this morning.", "I'll make a couple of brief comments before we begin. First,I would direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning,which contains much of the information that we will be covering in the call.Also, a quick reminder, that this call is subject to the \"forward-lookingstatements\" language contained in our press release. We will be makingcomments this morning that may include \"forward-looking statements\"as that term is defined by securities law.", "So I'll cover our fourth quarter and full year results andBill will make a few comments and then we'll get to your questions.", "Turning to the fourth quarter, our operating results were inline with what we discussed in our October 1st press release and on an adjustedbasis at consensus of $0.40 per share. Fourth quarter sales totaled $852.8million, up 8.8 % from last year. A result of increased sales in our businessesin markets outside of the U.S.is primarily related to our recent acquisitions.", "Adjusted for currency and acquisitions, sales were up 1.9%with the largest factor being soft sales in our architectural and wood coatingsproduct lines. The two businesses most affected by continued weakness in U.S.residential construction and housing markets.", "Our architectural sales in the second half did showimprovement compared to the first half of the year. Net income for the quarterwas $48.8 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.48 for the quarter,which includes an after-tax gain of $0.10 per share from the sale of assets anda $0.02 per share charge for an unfavorable tax adjustment, which I'll explainin a minute. And this number excludes a $0.03 per share non-cash adjustment forthe Huarun minority interest shares.", "Reported earnings per share were $0.45. In 2006, fourthquarter earnings were $52.1 million, or $0.51 per share, which included a $0.01per share charge for manufacturing rationalization and a net gain of $0.03 pershare resulting from favorable income tax adjustments.", "Excluding adjustments, the underlying EPS comparison for thefourth quarter is $0.40 per share in 2007 and $0.49 per share in 2006.", "For the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 29%, down from31.5% in the fourth quarter of 2006 and down from 31.6% when adjusted for lastyear's manufacturing rationalization.", "Now, about 1% of the decrease is due to three non-recurringitems that we discussed in our last call: one, manufacturing efficienciesresulting from inventory reduction; two, downsizing of an industrialmanufacturing plant; and three, manufacturing startup costs in Brazil.", "Roughly, another percentage pointis due to lower U.S. volume in our higher margin Paints segment, specifically,architectural and automotive refinish coatings and a little more than a halfpoint is due to increased raw material costs.", "Operating expenses were 20.1% forthe quarter, down two-tenths of a percent from 20.3% in 2006 with lowerincentive compensation costs, partially offsetting our investment in brandbuilding. The fourth quarter operating margin was 8.9% versus 11.2% last year.", "The tax rate for the fourth quarterwas 36%. The higher tax rate is related to an estimated reevaluation of our China entities'deferred tax accounts to reflect recent changes in Chinese Tax Law. Saidanother way, we expect our tax rate in China to be up going forward. Andso, we are adjusting our deferred tax accounts to reflect that expectation onour part. We expect the effective tax rate on income from ongoing operations tobe approximately 33% to 33.5% for fiscal 2008.", "Average shares outstanding weredown $1.1 million from a year ago, with the decline related to the acceleratedshare repurchase that we completed in the second quarter. During the fourthquarter, we didn't purchase any additional shares.", "Average shares outstanding were $101.8 million for thequarter and are projected to be a $102 million for the first quarter of 2008.As a reminder, we purchased approximately 2.6 million shares in 2007.", "Recapping our sales performance for the quarter, our coregrowth defined as volume, price mix combined was up 1.9%. Currency added 2.6%and acquisitions added another 4.3% for total net growth of 8.8% in thequarter.", "Now, turning to our segment results, Paint sales increased5.7% and were basically flat when adjusted for currency and acquisitions,reflecting the impact of soft architectural sales.", "Coatings sales increased 11.8% and were up low single-digitwhen adjusted for currency and acquisitions. As mentioned previously, coatingsales were impacted by soft sales in our wood coatings product line related tofurniture and new construction markets.", "General industrial sales were also somewhat soft, while ourcoil coatings achieved a solid performance in the fourth quarter. Packagingcoatings was our strongest sub-segment, up high single-digit and up midsingle-digit when adjusted for currency.", "Sales in our other category, which includes resins,colorants, gel coats and our furniture repair business, were up 1.4% and downslightly when adjusted for currency and for acquisitions.", "Looking at the full year, our Paints segment sales increased10.5% and were down low single-digit when adjusted for currency andacquisitions. Also for the full year, our Coatings segment was up 10% andbasically flat when adjusted for currency and acquisitions.", "Again, our best sales performance came from PackagingCoatings, which was up high single-digit for the year and up mid single-digitwhen adjusted for currency. And our Other segment was flat for the year andwhen adjusted for currency and acquisitions, down low single-digit.", "Addressing margins for the quarter by segment, our Paintssegment EBIT margin was 7.4%. Now adjusting for the brand spend, our Paintssegment EBIT margin would have been just under 11% for the quarter, down from12.7% in 2006 due to manufacturing inefficiencies resulting from our inventoryreduction actions.", "Our Coatings segment EBIT margin was 11.8% for the quarter,down from 12.9% for the fourth quarter of 2006. The EBIT margin for our Othercategory, which includes our corporate expenses, was 14.3% compared with negative4.8% last year. The increased in Other EBIT was due to the one-time sale ofassets mentioned in our press release. And excluding the gain, our Other EBITmargin would have been comparable to last year.", "Total company EBIT margin was 10.7% for the quarter, downfrom 11% in 2006 and without the asset sale, this year's EBIT margin would havebeen 8.7%.", "Looking at the full year, our Paints segment EBIT margin was9.7% versus 10.9% in 2006. The Coatings EBIT margin for the year was 10.7%compared to 12% last year. And the Other segment margin was positive 5.6%reported and positive 0.3% adjusted for the gain on sale of assets versusnegative 1.9% in 2006. Total company full year EBIT margin adjusted for theasset gain was 9.4% compared to 10.2% last year.", "So now, I'll move to the balance sheet. Total debt at theend of the fourth quarter was $1.17 billion, up $178 million from the $839million at the end of last fiscal year. The increase is due primarily to $172million for acquisitions and $72 million of share repurchases.", "We are now estimating that year end debt for fiscal 2008will be $850 million to $875 million, assuming no additional acquisitions orshare repurchases. Our year end debt-to-capital ratio was 42.4% with net debt-to-capitalat 40.3%.", "Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $29.2 million,down from $35 million in last year's fourth quarter. And for the full year,capital spending was $76.9 million versus $75.4 million in 2006. Our forecastfor 2008 capital spending is $60 million to $65 million.", "Depreciation and amortization for the fourth quarter totaled$20.3 million versus $17.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. Our full yeardepreciation and amortization was $71.8 million versus $68.7 million last year.The fourth quarter and full year depreciation expense figures from last yearinclude the impact of our manufacturing rationalization.", "Our forecast for depreciation and amortization combined in2008 is approximately $75 million. As mentioned in our release, our adjustedearnings per share from operations this year were $1.58.", "Looking to fiscal 2008, at this point, our currentexpectation is for 2008 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.65to $1.75. This assumes no improvement in economic conditions in the U.S.,raw material increases in the 2% to 3% range and modest improvements in ourpricing. This would represent approximately a 4% to 10% improvement in EPS fromoperations, which we think is reasonable, given our outlook for the U.S. economy.", "For 2008, we expect low double-digit sales growth in ourpackaging and auto refinish businesses and in Huarun Paints in China.These businesses represent about 30% of our total sales and are largely focusedon faster growth markets outside of the U.S. For the balance of ourbusinesses, we anticipate low single-digit growth exclusive of acquisitions,reflecting our conservative outlook for the U.S. economy.", "With those comments, I would like to turn the call over toBill Mansfield now.", "Bill Mansfield", "Thank you, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As Paulmentioned, in the fourth quarter we did exactly what we said we would do on ourOctober 1st call. Clearly, 2007 was a difficult year for us.", "At the beginning of the year, we felt the impact of theslowdown in the U.S.housing markets, particularly in our wood business and our architecturalbusiness. And, as the year progressed, we saw a slowdown start to occur in ourcoil business, particularly in our appliance part of our coil business and ourgeneral industrial business.", "Now those difficulties inside the U.S.were offset to some extent by reasonably good markets outside of the U.S.During 2007, we restored our U.S.wood coatings business to profitability by restructuring during the first halfof the year such that we could earn reasonable profits in a depressedmarketplace.", "Our packaging business did quite well during the year,particularly inside the U.S.and we had good performance in our international operation, particularly Fuller,Tekno in Braziland Huarun in China.", "We are pleased with our branding progress. We have madeconsistent gains in consumer awareness since our launch and we are in theprocess and have developed new business opportunities with the Valspar andCabot branded products. And we have expanded our global presence throughacquisitions, Tekno in Brazil,Teknos in Eastern Europe adds to our growing presence in China with the Huarun acquisition.", "I would like to say a brief word on Teknos. We announcedthis acquisition in the beginning of October. In 2006, Teknos had sales ofapproximately $42 million or EUR31 million. It provides Valspar with animmediate growth platform for coil coatings in fast growing markets of Centraland Eastern Europe, Russiaand the Baltic States and we are quite pleasedto have had the opportunity to make this acquisition.", "So, in 2007, we've made a solid progress on our growthinitiatives of branding, expanding our global presence and executing onstrategic acquisition opportunities.", "Now, having said that we are not at all satisfied with our2007 financial performance; as Paul said, for 2008, we expect a weak U.S. salesenvironment to continue through the year with the exception of our packagingbusiness. And, we also expect reasonable market conditions in our internationalmarkets.", "So, here is what we are doing to ensure improved 2008performance. Over the last three weeks, I met with over 600 Valspar employeesat their facilities around the world in the Americas,in Europe and Asia.", "The purpose of these meetings was to ensure that there was acomplete understanding and alignment on our strategy, that we had theappropriate focus on execution and that there were sound plans in place togenerate and deliver new business even in the U.S. markets. To make sure that theopportunities to improve our operations have been identified that the planswith well-defined targets, milestones and accountability were in place and thatthere was a clear understanding of what needs to get done, translate that toexecute to deliver improved financial performance in 2008.", "I was quite pleased with what I saw and heard from ouremployees. They are pushing very hard on improvements in operations, and byoperations, I don't just mean manufacturing, I am talking about closing newbusiness opportunities, implementing needed and required price increases andprudent cost control around the globe.", "We were successful in reducing our inventory. We indicatedan objective of a 5% to 10% reduction over our ending third quarter levels andI am pleased to tell you that we reduced our inventories by close to 7%. Theindustrial plant downsizing we talked about in our October 1st call is nearlycompleted and should contribute to cost savings next year.", "One other point I would like to make is I haven't talked alot at least externally, about our Lean Six Sigma initiative that we launchedinternally at the end of '06. But I can tell you on a global basis, we have 291active projects that are being worked on by Black Belts and Green Belts aroundthe globe. And, as these projects are completed, they should result inmeaningful improvements in the operations of our business.", "So I came away pleased that we have clearly definedexecution plans in place for all of our businesses and regions.", "So with those comments, I would like to open it up forquestions.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "Okay. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes fromthe line of Steve Schwartz from First Analysis. Please go ahead.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Hi, good morning.", "Bill Mansfield", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Can you help me understand, if I look at the day sales ordays of inventory, it looks like you have gone up slightly versus the thirdquarter, but you just commented you were down 7%. How are you looking at thator coming up with that 7% number?", "Lori Walker", "Steve, I think what you need to do is our fourth quarterincludes Teknos acquisition.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Okay.", "Lori Walker", "So, if you take the inventory up for the Teknos acquisition,it's actually down 7%.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Okay. All right.", "Lori Walker", "Roughly.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Okay. Can you give me that number, what that would be?", "Paul Reyelts", "That would be around $20 million reduction from the end ofthe third quarter.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Okay, great. And then, it sounds like you are looking for FY'08 to get price increases that are about in line with what you expect rawmaterial costs increases to be, is that right?", "Bill Mansfield", "That would be correct, Steve.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Okay. So what we have seen here in the fourth quarter, I'mcalling 55 basis points, we probably at this point just eat?", "Bill Mansfield", "No, I won't say that. I would tell you that pricing is adynamic function and that we are looking for probably in the order of 2% to 3%year-over-year increase in our material costs next year. And so, I wouldinclude the 55 basis points, as you said, into our overall pricing efforts.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Okay. And do you think that there is one channel retail orindustrial, where you are more likely to get more of an increase. So, in otherwords your retail channels, do you think they are receptive to a price increaseat this point?", "Bill Mansfield", "I would contrast the U.S.versus outside the U.S.as in a weak economic environment, it's a tough challenge, but our people willmeet it, and I tend to look at it that way.", "Steve Schwartz -First Analysis", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig from KeyBanc.Please go ahead.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Hi, good morning, guys.", "Bill Mansfield", "Good morning, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "What were the final numbers on the brand building this yearand what do you expect next year?", "Bill Mansfield", "Well, we've talked all along in 2007 and particularly in theOctober 1st call, that we would expect a decline next year of approximately $10million or about $0.07 a share. We spent somewhere around $0.25 to $0.27 ashare in 2007.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "All right. What was the cash flow from operations for theyear?", "Paul Reyelts", "Saul, we haven't done the cash flow statement yet.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Order of magnitude, Paul?", "Bill Mansfield", "What would you say, Lori?", "Lori Walker", "I'd [roughly get there too].", "Paul Reyelts", "Saul, I tell you why don't you let us get back to you onthat?", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. No problem.", "Paul Reyelts", "We really haven't had a chance to do that yet.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. On the raw materials, what was sort of the swing fromthe third to the fourth quarter, would you think there was any increase?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yeah, there was a small slight moment up.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Kind of like maybe 1% or so.", "Bill Mansfield", "Yeah, that would be in the ballpark, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. Now the point that you made, Bill, about the BlackBelts and the Green Belts and you made the change and you scaled down one ofyour industrial plants, if we were to look at the non-raw material costs aspart of cost of goods sold, if you look at your operating expenses in the costto goods sold why not the other operating expenses. Should they change, shouldthey go down, should they go up, there is inflation, I mean given all thethings that you're doing, what do you expect to achieve in '08 versus '07 in terms of your manufacturingcosts exclusive of raw materials?", "Bill Mansfield", "I would answer your question this way, Saul. I don't have aquantitative answer for you. I would tell you this that I'm confident thatex-raw material, all those other things that you talked about, we will be moreefficient in 2008 than we were in 2007.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "So that number as a percentage of revenue whatever it was,should go down?", "Bill Mansfield", "That's a good way to measure efficiency, I'd agree.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. And then finally, Paul could you give any moresegmentation of the volume, price mix 1.9%. How does that sort of split up?", "Bill Mansfield", "Well Saul, I'll tell you what our volumes improved throughthe year, and also our price mix improved somewhat through the year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "I was talking about the 1.9% change fourth quarter to fourthquarter. I know that would assume price mix was more than 1.9%.", "Paul Reyelts", "That's correct.", "Bill Mansfield", "Yeah, that's correct.", "Paul Reyelts", "Price mix was more. Volume was slightly negative.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. And could you give us any more granularity on that?", "Paul Reyelts", "No, sir.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. And then finally, given the pulse of things, andwithin the context of your outlook for next year, should we be thinking thatwe're going to start out on the negative side with regard to how your firstquarter might look without maybe any greater granularity but at leastdirectionally, do you see first quarter being a tough quarter?", "Bill Mansfield", "Saul, we've not been in the practice of providing quarterlyguidance and I would tell you that I don't think any quarter next year is goingto be any easier or tougher than any other at this point.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you very much, guys.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Don Carson fromMerrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Don Carson - MerrillLynch", "Yes, thank you. Paul, can you just comment on sort of your,I mean, you talked about the architectural coating difficulties we face. I knowone of the raw material suppliers was talking about maybe a 5% down market inthe U.S. again next year. What are you thinking of in terms of the strength ofthe architectural market, and what shifts do you see in channel? Do you thinkin an economic downturn that maybe more people might go DIY, which would workto Valspar's favor?", "And then, a question for Bill. You talked about new brandingopportunities or new sales opportunities as a result of your brandinginitiatives, if you could just expand on that?", "Bill Mansfield", "Let me try the last one first. I think it's premature tocomment on any specific opportunity. I can tell you that the increase inconsumer awareness clearly has gotten the attention of our major customers, andconsequently has resulted in additional opportunities for both Valspar andCabot brand, but it would be premature.", "With respect to the architectural market, whether it's down5% or not next year, I don't know. I can tell you that we for 2008 don'tbelieve the market will improve at all, and that's how we put our businesstogether.", "We also believe that housing turnover is a key determinantas we view the market. And again, I know there is lots of discussion aboutdifference in channel being professional or DIY, which is paint store versusbig-box, and I don't think there will be any, at least we don't see anysignificant move one way or another in 2008.", "Don Carson - MerrillLynch", "Thank you.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteynfrom Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Dmitry Silversteyn -Longbow Research", "Good morning. Just a couple of questions. I want to makesure that I understand you correctly. The inventory correction that you carriedout in the fourth quarter, you feel that you've gotten the inventory to thelevel that will support continuing slowing business in the United States?", "Bill Mansfield", "You bring up a good point, Dmitry. That 20 million wasprimarily in the U.S.and a lot of it was in our architectural business and I think those inventoriesare in reasonably good shape. There is always room for improvement in workingcapital, so we continue to focus on being more efficient users of workingcapital.", "Dmitry Silversteyn -Longbow Research", "Okay. But as far as you expect continuing weakness in the U.S.,I'm assuming you are producing at slightly lower volumes throughout the year toreflect that expectation?", "Bill Mansfield", "That will be correct.", "Dmitry Silversteyn -Longbow Research", "Okay. But you don't think you are going to need to correctthe inventories in a major way again?", "Bill Mansfield", "That would also be correct.", "Dmitry Silversteyn -Longbow Research", "Okay, excellent. General industrial business as far ascoatings is concerned was okay in the first half of the year and then itsounded like in the third and fourth quarter, it seems to have gotten weaker?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yes.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Can you kind of take us through the sequential, kind ofmonth-to-month changes, and what you are seeing right now, and do you expectthat business becoming a major source of weakness similar to architecturalcoatings in 2008, or do you thinks it's plateauing here?", "Bill Mansfield", "No. My sense is, I can't do month-to-month, we don't havethat kind of\u2026", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "I understand, but at least directionally.", "Bill Mansfield", "Yeah, directionally. My sense is, Dmitry, that it's probablyreached a plateau. I am concerned about the number of extended shutdowns thatour customers have announced over the holiday period. Typically, you haveperhaps two weeks and now it's three weeks, but having said, that talking toour customers I think we'd probably hit a plateau that I think will just stayat for 2008.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. And sort of packaging and the coil coating outside ofthe appliance applications as well as Huarun sounds like are going to be thedriver and the automotive after-market, going to be drivers in 2008?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yes, our packaging business is doing quite well. We'rereally pleased with the performance. Huarun continues to do well. And certainlyour coil business and frankly even parts of our general industrial businessoutside of the U.S.are quite healthy.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, very good. And then you mentioned that you expect rawmaterials to be up about 2% to 3% year-over-year in 2008. From what you'reseeing right now and kind of where you're suppliers are coming to you withtheir proposals right now. Do you see a possibility of a spike inDecember-January period as we have a couple of years ago? Or do you think itwill be more like last year, where it's more gradual increases through out theyear.", "Bill Mansfield", "I think our suppliers have made a broad range ofannouncements that really were at the turn of the quarter, October 1st, a greatnumber of them are still being negotiated. I think it's probably premature.Although I would say there is probably more pressure in the first six months ofthe year than the second half of '08.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. Thank you.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rosemarie Morbellifrom Ingalls & Snyder. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "Good morning, all.", "Bill Mansfield", "", "Good morning, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "A little clarification, Bill. You said that, you expect theweak environment to continue in the U.S. in 2008 and you also talkedabout plateau in, if I understood properly in the coatings area. Do you expectto continue an increasing decline in the other areas or plateau across theboard?", "Bill Mansfield", "No, Rosemarie, in the U.S. we expect the currentconditions, those conditions that we have experienced in our fourth quarter tocontinue for full year 2008.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "But not weakening further?", "Bill Mansfield", "No, we do not have any weakening further in our outlook.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "And if you could talk about Europe a little bit, becausethere are signs that Western Europe is slowingdown. Are you seeing it, and how large is Western Europeas part of your international business?", "Bill Mansfield", "Well, having just been there, I would agree there is concernwith respect to the strength of the Euro, the weakness of the dollar. Andinterestingly enough, they are also experiencing in some markets, Germany, UK decline in housing prices. Ourbiggest business and most important business in Europeis our packaging business. And that has demonstrated through the years aresiliency through the ups and downs of the economic cycle. And we anticipatewe will have a good year in Europe in ourpackaging business in 2008.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "One thing, which if my memory serves me right, affects yourpackaging business is weather, the crops are good, salmon fishing and that sortof thing. Are you hearing anything and are you anticipating some of your endmarkets to be slower for one reason or another?", "Bill Mansfield", "", "Well, I will complement you on your memory Rosemarie, that'sabout every reason I have used, you captured in your comments. However, I wouldtell you that there are no unusual conditions that we see today that wouldnegatively impact the business.", "Rosemarie Morbelli- Ingalls & Snyder", "And you are lowering your CapEx level substantially for nextyear, are you eliminating some previously anticipated projects, just pushingthem out? Or do you feel that the reason is mostly that you are done with thebranding and other big projects?", "Bill Mansfield", "", "No, I think it's more our prudent approach to 2008. We arepushing some projects back such that they would be done, second half of '08,first half of '09, which on a full year '08 basis will result in some reducedcapital spending.", "Rosemarie Morbelli- Ingalls & Snyder", "What are we talking about, expansion of plans? Can you giveus a feel for what you are pushing?", "Bill Mansfield", "No, these are mostly internal efficiency projects,replacement perhaps of some equipment with more efficient equipment.", "Rosemarie Morbelli- Ingalls & Snyder", "Wouldn't you benefit from doing that when you expect a lowdemand and get us as much efficiencies as you possibly can?", "Bill Mansfield", "As I've said, our judgment, we think the prudent thing to dois to conduct it the way I described it.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "And if I may ask one last question, regarding gross margin,it was 29% in the fourth quarter; 28.7% in the first quarter of '07, based onall of the steps you are taking and all of your comments and then lessinvestments in the branding and so on. Do you expect next year's margin to beabove those two low levels?", "Bill Mansfield", "I don't think we have looked it at that closely yet,Rosemarie. You're asking a quarterly question, I'd go back to my prior comment.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "No, for the full year, I am just using that particular leveland looking at the full year. Those were the two lowest levels in '07. So, I amtaking those.", "Bill Mansfield", "Flat, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay, thanks.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of [James Sheehan]from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "James Sheehan -Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. Another question on raw materials, you referencedback in your previous call some pressure in Europe.Is that continuing, and do you expect more of that in '08 and could you tell usor give us a little more color on what types of raw materials you are seeing thepressure in?", "Bill Mansfield", "Well, at $95 a barrel of crude oil, we're seeing pressureacross the board. I don't think there is any one particular segment that'soutshining another. And we're seeing a continuing of a pressure in Europe on material costs. Fortunately, sometimes in thepast, it's been perhaps just a group, propylene derivatives, as an example wehave talked about in the past. But today, given the increase in BTU costs, beit gas and/or oil, it is pretty much across the board pressure.", "James Sheehan -Deutsche Bank", "And is your pricing in Europe keeping pace with the rawmaterial increase just in Europe?", "Bill Mansfield", "We have pricing initiatives underway in Europe,and they have been underway for a while now to recover what we have experienced.", "James Sheehan -Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And you mentioned on the acquisition that you did inthe Central and Eastern Europe area, is that an example of the type of M&Athat we can expect in the future or can you comment a little bit more about theM&A pipeline?", "Bill Mansfield", "Well, the pipeline, there are still deals, potential dealsthat are under discussion. And I think your point about this is this the kindof acquisition we are likely to see Valspar make going forward. If you look atour history over the past three years that is exactly the kind of acquisitionwe have been making. And so, I would think that that's a pretty good bet forthe future.", "James Sheehan -Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And real quickly on the all other segment, is theincrease in there reflective of the gain on sale of assets?", "Bill Mansfield", "Exactly.", "James Sheehan -Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome, James.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sergey Vasnetsov from Lehman Brothers. Please go ahead.", "Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers", "Good morning.", "Bill Mansfield", "Good morning, Sergey.", "Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers", "Just briefly on the results, I think you should be proud ofwhat you accomplished in conditions which are very challenging, because I certainlyremember conversations a year ago in advance of the housing cycle decline, Ithink people have been circulating that, given your exposure you would havebeen -- you will be hit a little harder than you actually have been.", "Bill Mansfield", "Thank you for the compliment, Sergey.", "Sergey Vasnetsov - Lehman Brothers", "I want to ask you when you think [of below fuel] conditionsSeptember to October to November, even though November is just in the midst ofthe month, sequentially what kind of trends do you see?", "Bill Mansfield", "What kind of trends do we see?", "Sergey Vasnetsov -Lehman Brothers", "Yeah, on volume and pricing?", "Bill Mansfield", "On volume and pricing, September, October, November,certainly what I can comment on, is we got concerned. That's why we had the callon October 1st. We got concerned what we saw in September versus June, July,August, to a certain extent. And I would tell you that October, Novembercontinued about the same as September's performance. There wasn't any realsignificant change either up or down between either our Paint segment orCoating segment.", "With respect to pricing, I presume you mean our finished,our pricing to our customers and we continue to execute on pricing initiativesthat we had been doing pretty much all of 2007. They were selective rifle shotapproaches. I think we'll be doing some more broad-based pricing as we go into2008.", "Sergey Vasnetsov -Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And so, could you please clarify your expectationsfrom the customers' inventories. I think you touched on this earlier, but thefirst quarter of 2007 was impacted by significant adjustments of inventories atone of your large customers. What do you see going into the winter month,between now and March of next year?", "Bill Mansfield", "I think this question I presume is related again to thePaint segment.", "Sergey Vasnetsov -Lehman Brothers", "Yes.", "Bill Mansfield", "And I think our customers' inventories are in reasonablygood shape, and I don't anticipate there will be an inventory correction likewe experienced last year.", "Sergey Vasnetsov -Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome, Sergey.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Koort fromGoldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Bob Koort - GoldmanSachs", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Bill Mansfield", "Good morning, Bob.", "Bob Koort - GoldmanSachs", "Couple of questions, I think Paul you might have said thatauto refinish was down year-on-year, is that right, and if so, what's going onthere?", "Paul Reyelts", "I don't recall saying that.", "Bill Mansfield", "No, I don't think that's the case, Bob.", "Bob Koort - GoldmanSachs", "Okay, good. I must have misheard. And then when I look atwhat Lowe's had to say today, they talked about a little bit of pick upactually in fourth quarter here, slight they termed it, but they also talkedabout opening another 10% to the store count next year. I am just wondering isthat that the inventory channel fill, is that significant to you or given thatit's only 10% of their store base and Lowe's is not 50% of your sales, is itirrelevant?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yeah, it's not relevant, because there is no year-over-yearbenefit. New store openings occurred in '07, they are going to occur in '08,they occurred in '06 and relatively around the same size. So, on a year-over-yearbasis, it's not a significant change.", "Bob Koort - GoldmanSachs", "And I was wondering if you might, Bill, be able to dumb itdown for me. If the U.S.market is going to be weaker and I can't remember the term you used for globalmarket something like reasonable. Would you expect growth outside the U.S. basically to offset whatever slippage youmight see in the U.S.or is it something more subtle at play?", "Bill Mansfield", "No, I think that's fair, the way you just described it. Westill expect to grow in the U.S.but certainly not to the extent that we grow outside the U.S. Like Paul talked about, Huarunand some of our other businesses outside the U.S.at high single-digits and that would imply the U.S. business still growing butmuch, much smaller than that.", "Paul Reyelts", "And on the bottom line, obviously much tighter control ofexpenses in the domestic markets and some of the faster growth markets outsideof the U.S.", "Bob Koort - GoldmanSachs", "Got it. Thank you.", "Bill Mansfield", "You are welcome, Bob.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar fromCiti. Please go ahead.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Yes, hi, good morning.", "Bill Mansfield", "Good morning, P.J.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Bill, architectural paint organic growth was negative. Can youjust sort of break that down between pricing and volume, so that we know whathappened to volumes?", "Bill Mansfield", "No, I can't. But I will tell you that volumes on a full yearbasis were negative.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Sort of mid single digit?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yeah.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Okay. And then looking into next year, you mentioned thatyou expect raw material costs to go up 2% to 3%, that sounds conservative, Imean it could be lot more than that given where oil is and given where all theraw materials are going?", "Bill Mansfield", "I don't disagree that it could be a lot more. We have topick a planning number that seem to be a reasonable number, and like we did in2005, if material costs should shoot up more than what we have anticipated, wewould take the appropriate pricing steps.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Okay. And then your brand advertising for Valspar brand, howdoes that ramp up has taken place, how does that play out in '08 and when doyou begin to ramp down? When do you feel that your advertising is good enoughthat there is -- are you doing consumer service and when do you think you won'tfeel the need to advertise as heavily?", "Bill Mansfield", "Never, we will always advertise. I think what we were tryingto communicate is with the launch in 2007 that is clearly the year of greatestexpense.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Right.", "Bill Mansfield", "In 2008, it will ramp down by roughly $0.07 a share or $10million of expense, and then going forward, I would expect that there would besome perhaps modest decline in '09 and '010. But more importantly, as we getthrough and reach the bottom of the housing impact, we'll start to gainleverage with that advertising expense as we grow our business.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Right. And in your mind, how was this advertising orbranding campaign taken place so far, have you done any studies with theconsumers and what's been the feedback?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yes. Our consumer awareness numbers have increasedsignificantly month-over-month. We do this on a monthly basis. We use aresearch firm or we conduct consumer interviews quite scientific in its design.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Can you quantify some numbers, you said significantly, butcan you just give us some numbers?", "Bill Mansfield", "I really can't, P.J., that would be a step too far in termsof visibility relative to the competitive environment.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Okay. I may come back to you on that later.", "Bill Mansfield", "That would be fine. Please feel free to call me.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Thank you.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome, P.J.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskasfrom J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "Good morning. This is Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?", "Bill Mansfield", "Fine, Silke.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "I also have a couple of questions. The strength in thepackaging business and the coil business, to what extent is that due to marketshare opportunities caused by the Akzo ICI merger?", "Bill Mansfield", "I think that, well, I'll tell you in our packaging business,it's more about technology and it's about having the technology that thecustomer needs and wants and contributes through efficiency in their operationsand that's the primary driver.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "But it seems those numbers you've given include the marketshare gains.", "Bill Mansfield", "I would hope they would, yes.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "You've given the scaling back of capital outlays. What isthe likelihood of $4 million share repurchase to be completed over the next 12months?", "Bill Mansfield", "That would be speculative on my part. We have thisauthorization each year and we would expect to execute on the authorization asmarket conditions dictate it.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "", "Okay, and maybe two more if I can?", "Bill Mansfield", "Sure.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "You said that most of your hydrocarbon-based raw materialsare going up and how about the mineral-based ones, like pigments, are thosealso going up?", "Bill Mansfield", "Well, if you are using titanium dioxide, as an example of apigment, there is a significant energy component in that. And other than that,I really frankly don't have that level of detail available.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "And lastly, are there other planned rationalizationopportunities that you would have, and where would those be?", "Bill Mansfield", "There are always opportunities to more efficiently operatethe facilities, but the question is directed towards to would we anticipate amanufacturing rationalization, like we went through in '05 and '06. At thispoint, no, we do not anticipate that.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "Something on the smaller scale?", "Bill Mansfield", "We have always continued to do it on a smaller scale. Wehave never really talked about it a lot in terms of a non-recurring.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "In the respect [just that since I am on], how important iscommercial construction versus residential and what have you seen in thecommercial construction market?", "Bill Mansfield", "Commercial construction is quite important to us,particularly in our coil coatings business, where we have a major position,particularly in the U.S.in commercial building, like industrial metal type manufacturing buildings. Andalso in Extrusion coatings, which are used in monumental buildings, largeoffice towers.", "The second segment that I commented on the Extrusioncoatings are doing quite well. That major construction, big offices tends to alag in downturn and lag in upturn, whereas in our commercial building businesswe have seen some weakness in the US in the second half of the yearin that business.", "Silke Kueck - J.P.Morgan", "Thank you very much.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome, Silke.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John McNulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "JohnMcNulty - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, good morning.", "Bill Mansfield", "Good morning, John.", "JohnMcNulty - Credit Suisse", "With regard to your sales forecast,can you just let me know if that's including currency, and if so, what yourassumptions are for FX?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yes. We will let you know. I don'tknow if I can answer that question sitting here right now.", "JohnMcNulty - Credit Suisse", "But it did include foreign currencythough?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yes.", "JohnMcNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then in the packagingbusiness with the expectations for double-digit growth, I know you had citedtechnology as being a big driver behind kind of the growth that you are seeingthere. What if any major new platforms have you launched, because it soundslike you are looking for growth, it's about four times kind of the normalizedgrowth rate of the packaging space?", "Bill Mansfield", "Well, normalized growth rate, the U.S.market, I don't disagree with you, that's about a flat market. But there issignificant growth in units occurring in Europe, Middle East, Eastern Europe andAsia also. Asiais a bit of a change from it was several years ago. The unit volumes actuallyare growing and no surprise are actually growing in China. So, there is an organicgrowth story there relative to units.", "We haven't necessarily launchedany brand new platforms in the last couple of months. In this business, productlife cycles tend to be quite long. And some of the things, some of thetechnologies that we introduced several years ago are now starting to gain somepretty good traction. One of which would be, our water-based beverage and coating,and the traction is being gained on a global scale, and we are quite pleasedwith that progress.", "JohnMcNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. And then lastquestion, with your net debt-to-cap now kind of at a pretty manageable level,it looks like it's below 40% again. Would you be more inclined to be buyingback stock now or saving up for further bolt-on acquisitions or is it kind of apick them day-to-day?", "Bill Mansfield", "I think that's a situationalissue, John. We don't tend to look at it on an absolute basis. I think it'smore situational.", "Paul Reyelts", "Our main goal with stockrepurchases is to offset dilution from options, and some years we bought alittle more, other years we buy a little less, but over time I think our goalis to keep our share count relatively flat. Now, circumstances could suggest wego a little more one direction or the other, but that's our longer-term goal.", "JohnMcNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking myquestions.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome, John.", "Operator", "You have a follow-up from theline of [James Sheehan] from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. I just want to clarify with Paul on the autorefinish business, I think you were characterizing the drop in gross margin aspartially due to lower U.S. volumes in architectural paints, and partially dueto auto refinish coatings, could you explain what was the cause for the lowermargin there?", "Paul Reyelts", "What I was trying to suggest is that we had a mix change as itrelates to our margin. In other words, softness in architectural and in theauto refinish resulted in having fewer or less sales in higher gross marginsegment. Does that make sense to you?", "James Sheehan -Deutsche Bank", "Okay. So, the overall volumes in auto refinish, could youjust characterize them, were they flat or up or what were they?", "Paul Reyelts", "They were pretty much flat.", "James Sheehan -Deutsche Bank", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome, James.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from Rosemarie Morbelli fromIngalls & Snyder. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "Just quickly, could you remind us what the situation is withHuarun. Are we going to see the end of this minority interest shares or is thisgoing on forever because of the situation there, [your split in] ownership. Andif it is going to go on forever, why separate them from operations?", "Paul Reyelts", "It won't go on forever. There is a put in a call that has adate of -- I think it's July of 2009. And so, we anticipate that either theminority shareholders will put or that we will call at that date. That's ourbest guess. That's what we're assuming in terms of how the charge is beingcalculated today.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "And so, what is going to be the net-net, whether one doesone thing or the other thing. What is the net-net in July of '09?", "Paul Reyelts", "Well, these are relating to the shares that are owned bynon-management shareholders. So, we still have some management shareholdersthat own a small amount, less than 10%. So, the assumption is that the outsideshareholders at that point will want to exercise their put. We can't forecastfor share, but that's the assumption at this point.", "Lori Walker", "So, what ends up happening is that mandatory redeemablestock, non-cash charge are seeing, at the time that they put a recall, theentire amount will reverse. So it will be a pick up at that point in time.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "I see. So this is why we are using it as a non-recurring,because it will reverse itself at the end of the period.", "Lori Walker", "Right.", "Bill Mansfield", "Correct.", "Rosemarie Morbelli -Ingalls & Snyder", "", "Okay, thanks.", "", "Bill Mansfield", "", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And you have a follow-up from Saul Ludwig from KeyBanc.Please go ahead.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "On the incentive comp, I know back in the third quarter year-over-year,it was down and I guess, I assume it was down in the fourth quarter. What wasthe magnitude of that drop-off in incentive comp in the fourth quarter and forthe year?", "Bill Mansfield", "", "Well, Saul, I don't have the number in front of me, but year-over-year,there was a drop-off in the fourth quarter. That's a pretty good headwind in 2008.I think it's fair to say, and we also have incorporated that into our guidance.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "When you say a headwind, meaning there will be more of it?", "Bill Mansfield", "Yeah. We're not going to go two years in a row.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Do you have any idea what magnitude that in a sense helpedyour earnings this year?", "Bill Mansfield", "Not on top of my head, I don't, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. And you mentioned that in the higher margin productsin the architectural, I know I was under the impression that as you were rollingout the Valspar brand as a signature product, it was moving stronger than justthe Valspar brand product, but am I to interpret from your commentary that itwas the reverse?", "Paul Reyelts", "No.", "Bill Mansfield", "No.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Then what was the higher margin product that wasn\u2019t sellingso well?", "Paul Reyelts", "Across the Board, architectural gross margins are higherthan, say, industrial margins or coatings gross margin as a whole. It goes upwith the architectural category, not within the architectural product spectrum.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "All right", "Paul Reyelts", "Exactly.", "Bill Mansfield", "So, all we are trying to communicate was in the fourth quarter,our mix was not as rich as it had been in prior quarters.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Got you. And then, finally, do you think by spending $10million less in advertising in support of the brand, that\u2019s going to have anynegative effect on volume?", "Paul Reyelts", "It was always going to be a 5-year plan, and we arefollowing a 5-year plan that was put in place probably over a year ago. So, itisn\u2019t like we decided to lower next year, to modify our approach based oncircumstances. It just was the plan all along. So, I don\u2019t know if that answersyour question, but we are not adjusting to a good or bad environment in termsof our plan for advertising.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "I am just wondering, I know it\u2019s the plan, but if you spendless, do you think it will have any negative effect once you go out the door?", "Bill Mansfield", "No, Saul. We don't nor do our customers.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBancCapital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Bill Mansfield", "You're welcome, Saul.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions.", "Bill Mansfield", "Well, thank you everyone. We appreciate your attending ouryear-end conference call. To summarize, a difficult environment in 2007, but weaccomplished a number of things strategically. We think we're well positionedgoing forward in to 2008 to deliver improved financial results and we lookforward to speaking with you in February at our first quarter conference call.Thank you everybody.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be available forreplay after 1:30 Central Time today to December 3rd.

After the review of our fourth quarter and full year results and 2008 expectations, we will open the session to questions.", "I will now turn the conference over to Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Diego. Good morning everybody. In order to allow more time for questions, we have provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website sherwin.com under investor relations fourth quarter press release.", "Summarizing overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2007, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter were up 3.3% to $1.85 billion. For the full year, sales grew $195.5 million or 2.5% to $8.01 billion due to strong sales by our global group and acquisitions. Acquisition completed during the year increased consolidated net sales $52.5 million or 2.9% in the quarter and $110.6 million or 1.4% in the year.", "Favorable currency translation rate increased consolidated net sales $23.0 million or 1.3% in the fourth quarter and $53.7 million or 7/10 of a percent in the year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 44.9% of sales from 43.0% in the fourth quarter of 2006.", "For the year, gross margin increased to 44.9% of sales compared to 43.7% in 2006. Gross margin in the quarter and in the year, benefited from higher selling prices, mixed improvement, stabilizing raw material cost and improved operating efficiencies.", "Selling, general and administrative expense decreased as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter to 34.7% from 34.8% in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2007, SG&A expense increased to 32.4% of sales from 32.2% in 2006. Tight expense management across all operating divisions could not fully offset an increase in SGA from acquisitions, and the effect of a slowdown in sales growth on SG&A percentage for the year.", "In the fourth quarter, the company took a goodwill impairment charge of $15.2 million or approximately $0.08 per share in anticipation of reduction in performance of certain foreign and domestic acquisitions.", "Interest expense for the quarter increased by $2.7 million to $19.2 million due to an increase in short-term borrowings. Interest and net investment income declined by $5.3 million in the quarter. For the year, interest expense increased $4.5 million and interest in net investment income decreased $10.5 million. The decline in interest and net investment income in the quarter and the year, reflect our use of cash and short-term investments to continue to invest in our business. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2007 increased to 33.7% from 22% in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year, our effective tax rate was 32.6% compared to 31% in 2006.", "Consolidated net income for the quarter increased by $2.1 million, or 2.2% to $100.8 million from $98.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2006. For the year, net income increased $39.5 million, or 6.9%. Net income, as a percentage of sales decreased to 5.4% in the fourth quarter this year from 5.5% in the fourth quarter last year. This decline was due to the year-over-year increase in our fourth quarter income tax rate. For the year, net income as a percentage of sales increased to 7.7% in 2007, from 7.4% in 2006.", "Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2007 was $0.80 per share including $0.08 per share impairment charge compared to $0.73 per share in fourth quarter 2006. For the full year, diluted net income per common share increased 12.2% to $4.70 per share, from $4.19 per share in 2006.", "Breaking down our performance by segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in fourth quarter 2007 increased 2.3% to $1.14 billion. For the year, net sales increased 2.3% to $4.96 billion, increased paint sales to commercial contractors and improved industrial maintenance product sale in the quarter in the year were more than offset by soft architectural paint sales to new residential painting contractors and DIY customers and weak sales in non-paint categories.", "The acquisition of M.A. Bruder and Columbia Paint increased net sales for the group 3.7% in the quarter and 1.9% for the year. Comparable store sales decreased 2.5% in the quarter and 1.1% for the year.", "Regionally, in the fourth quarter, Midwest division led all divisions followed by Southwest division and Eastern division. Southeastern division finished in fourth place. Three of the four paint stores divisions grew their business before acquisitions in the fourth quarter and the full year.", "Segment operating profit to the Paint Stores Group decreased 3.2% to $157.6 million in the fourth quarter and increased 6.5% to $766.5 million for the year. The timing of the acquisitions reduced segment operating profit by 7.4% in the quarter and 2.2% for the year.", "Segment operating profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased to 13.8% from 14.6% last year due to the acquisitions. Profit margin for the full year 2007 improved to 15.5% from 14.9% in 2006. Margin improvements for the year were due primarily to effective SG&A expense control and higher selling prices that more than offset the drag from acquisitions.", "Turning now to the Consumer Group, external net sales in the Consumer Group decreased $14 million or 5% to $264.3 million for the fourth quarter and $52.6 million or 3.9% to $1.31 billion for the year, compared to the same period last year. The sales declines were due primarily to sluggish do-it-yourself demand.", "Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter including a goodwill impairment charge of $4.2 million increased $400,000 or 1.8% to $21.3 million. Segment operating profit for the year rose $9.9 million or 4.6% to $224.2 million. As a percent of net sales, Consumer Group's operating profit increased to 8.1% from 7.5% for the quarter 17.1% from 15.7% for the year.", "For our Global Group, net sales in the fourth quarter increased $47.9 million or 11.9% to $449.8 million. Sales for the year increased $138 million or 8.7% to $1.73 billion. Sales in local currency grew by 6.1% in the quarter, and 5.3% in the year due primarily to volume growth, selling price increases and acquisitions.", "Global Group segment operating profit in the fourth quarter increased $7.2 million or 34.1% to $28.4 million. Segment operating profit for the full year increased $30 million or 23.2% to $160.7 million. Stated in local currency, segment profit increased 20.5% and 18.5% for the fourth quarter and full year respectively.", "Global Group profit for the quarter and year were negatively impacted by a fourth quarter pretax charge of $11 million for goodwill impairment. For the quarter and the year, Global segment operating profit benefited from strong sales increases, improved operating efficiencies and expense control that were partially offset by acquisitions.", "I'd now like to comment briefly on our balance sheet items. You will find more balance sheet information on our website under sherwin.com, investor relations press releases. Our total debt on December 31, 2007 was $965.4 million including short-term borrowings of $657.1 million. Total debt, as a percentage of total capitalization increased to 35.4% in 2007 from 30.6% at the end of 2006.", "Our cash balance at year end 2007 was $27.3 million compared to $469.4 million in 2006. Our working capital ratio declined, as accounts receivable plus inventories, less accounts payable to sales increased to 12.7% in 2007 from 11.7% in 2006. This increase reflects the partial year impact of the timing of acquisitions completed during the year plus the effect of foreign currency translation.", "Going forward, we expect working capital to decline as a percentage of sales, as we more fully integrate the acquired businesses. Capital expenditures were $48.7 million in the fourth quarter and $165.9 million for the year compared to $209.9 million in 2006.", "Depreciation expense was $38 million in the quarter and $139 million for the year. And amortization expense was $7.2 million in the quarter and $24.5 million for the year. In 2008, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $175 million to $200 million. Depreciation will be about $145 million and amortization will be about $27 million.", "I will conclude this review with a brief update on our status, the status of our lead litigation. In our appeal before the Rhode Island Supreme Court, a scheduler proceeding has been set by the court. Opening breach's are due at the end of January, response rates are due in March and required rates are due in April. Oral arguments schedule to be held in mid May. In the ongoing abatement proceedings in Superior Court, the judge appointed two co-examiners, formally referred to as special masters, to assist the court in evaluating issues related to the abatement process. Their powers and responsibility were outlined in an order of the court in June 2007.", "In Ohio, opponents of Senate Bill 117, a bill that clarifies Ohio's product liability law, failed to gather the signatures needed to put a recall referendum on the 2008 ballot. On December 12, '07, the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas granted the defendants motion to dismiss the suit brought by the City of Toledo.", "In its ruling, the court stated that the plaintiff must establish a casual connection between the defendant's actions and the plaintiff's injury and their public nuisance actions brought in Ohio were intended to be aggregated by the Ohio Product Liability Act. The City of Toledo has not appealed this decision. Of the 11 Municipal Public nuisance suits filed in Ohio since late 2006, all but one has been dismissed or voluntarily withdrawn. The still remaining case is the City of Columbus suit joined by the Ohio Attorney General in motion to dismiss the pending before the court in this suit.", "In Wisconsin, the trial of the Thomas case, a single point of suit brought on behalf of a minor child ended in November with a unanimous jury verdict for the defendant. Importantly, the jury found that although Steven Thomas did had elevated blood lead levels as a child; he was not harmed as a result.", "In California, plaintiffs have appealed the Santa Clara County Superior Court ruling that government plaintiffs cannot enter into contingency fee arrangements with outside lawyers to prosecute public nuisance lawsuits.", "In January of this year, oral arguments were made before the court appeal. That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2007. So, I'll turn the call over to Chris Conner, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2008. Chris?", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Bob and good morning everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Market conditions for paint and coatings in North America were very challenging in 2007. New residential consumption was down in a high 20% range for the year. Existing home turnover declined nearly 20%; consumer spending slowed dramatically, credit markets contracted, manufacturing activity turned negative. Consumer confidence sag and GDP growth stalled. In short, it was exactly the kind of year that we anticipated 12 months ago.", "We entered 2007 prepared for the inevitable slowdown in end market demand and as a result of this preparation, Sherwin turn in, what I would describe, as a solid performance last year. Consolidated net sales grew a modest 2.5% to just over $8 billion in sale. Consolidated net income increased almost 7% and earnings per share increased more than 12% to a record $4.70 per share. All three of our operating segments improved earnings and operating margin for the year and we managed expense as well across the entire company.", "Sales, net income and earnings per share are all pretty important indicators of our performance and vitality of the company, but I would like to take a few minutes, which I usually do on this call to highlight some of the numbers behind these numbers, because I think they help put the strength of our results last year in perspective.", "For example, earnings before interest taxes, depreciation and amortization increased by more than $100 million or 10%, to $1.15 billion in 2007. This increase is a reflection of our success in generating strong cash earnings leverage and our modest sales improvement for the year.", "As a result of our operating profit performance, net operating cash for the year increased to $874 million, well over 10% of sales from $816 million in 2006. During the year, we used this cash to continue to invest the company's cash to create value for our shareholders.", "For example, in 2007, we invested over $280 million to complete seven acquisitions. These acquisitions further increased our paint coat penetration in North America, adding 172 M. A. Bruder and the Columbia Paint locations for our Paint Stores Group. Our Global segment strengthened its automotive finishes, architectural, and industrial coatings portfolio in Mexico and Latin America and we gained access to the high growth Indian market for the first time last year.", "We also continue to invest in organic growth. In 2007, our Paint Stores Group opened 107 net new stores at year end.  The combination of acquisitions and organic store openings boosted our store count to 3325 stores in the U.S. and Canada compared to 3046 stores at the end of 2006.", "This year, we will continue to pursue our goal of 2% to 3% organic growth in store count opening in the range 100 plus net new stores again. We are equally committed to returning a portion of the cash we generate to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and cash dividends.", "In the fourth quarter of 2007, the company took advantage of the continued weakness in the housing sector that has depressed our stock price. We purchased 3 million shares of our common stock in the open markets during the quarter, bringing the total shares purchased in 2007 to 13.2 million, a record level for our company.", "We closed 2007 with remaining board authorization to purchase 27 million shares. This strong opportunistic buying reflects management's confidence to the company's underlying value and significant earnings power remains intact.", "2007 also marked our 29th consecutive year of dividend increases, the same we intend to continue. At our next meeting with the Board of Directors, I will be recommending a continuation of our policy of paying out approximately 30% of prior year's earnings per share in the form of a cash dividend in 2008. This would result in a quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share or $1.40 per share for the year, an increase of 11.1% over the $1.26 per share we paid out in 2007.", "Looking ahead to 2008, we expect market conditions in North America to remain difficult, particularly in the first half of the year. In spite of this fact, we are confident that we will sustain our strong operating momentum and earnings leverage. We anticipate that first quarter consolidated net sales will increase in percentage terms in the low to mid single digit versus the first quarter of 2007. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.72 to $0.80 per share, compared to $0.83 per share earned in the first quarter of 2007.", "For the full year 2008, we expect net sales will also increase in the low to mid single digits over 2007. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2008 will be in the range of $5 to $5.15 per share, compared to current analyst consensus of $5.03 for 2008, and $4.70 per share earned in 2007.", "One final note on January 22nd, Fortune Magazine once again named Sherwin-Williams on their list of America's 100 best companies to work for. For us, this is more than a popularity contest. Our continued growth depends on our ability to attract and retain the best and brightest talents in our industry. Being named on this prestigious list, there are significant ways with perspective employees and the firms that our current employees recognize the quality work environment we have all worked so hard to create. We sincerely appreciate the hard work and dedication our employees put into achieving another record year in 2007.", "And with that, we will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with FTN Midwest Research. Please state your question.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Good morning everyone.", "Chris Connor", "Hi, Chuck.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "First question little bit of housekeeping just I want to make sure I understand something in the release. It said the Paints Stores segment saw profits down 7.4% in the quarter, as result of acquisition. Should: why not simply apply that 7.4% to the $163 million in the Paint Stores segment profit in '06 fourth quarter?", "Chris Connor", "Hang on Chuck, just looking for that line.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "It's on -- at least on my release page 2 second line.", "Chris Connor", "7.4 okay, yeah, okay. Paint Stores Group segment increased 6.5% in the year and decreased 3.2% in the quarter. The timing of acquisitions caused the segment to be negatively impacted 2.2% in the year and 7.4% in the quarter. Yes, what you read it was correct.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "All right, thank you. Looking at 2007: Chris how do you expect the acquisitions to impact profitability?", "Chris Conner", "2007 or '08 Chuck?", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "2008 sorry.", "Chris Conner", "Hey, do you want to take that Shaun.", "Shaun Hennessy", "Sure. In 2008, we basically believe that the acquisitions that were completed in '07 will be flat to down slightly for the year 0 to $0.02 for the year.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Is that the economy or is that anticipated at the time of the acquisitions?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Let's say timing and basically when you take a look at the market in North America, the timing of the acquisitions in that cycle of North America.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Got you. Now for the bigger picture, I'm thinking about your guidance for 2008 sales. Chris, how would you sort of allocate that sales growth between price volume and contribution from existing acquisitions?", "Chris Connor", "I think, as we kind of look at next year's sales, I'll break it down in a couple of ways for you and the rest of the listeners by segment. We expect that our Stores Group for the year is going to be up in the low to mid-single digit. We expect our Consumer Group to be flat, up slightly this year and the Global Group to continue to be our strongest performer up in the mid to high single digit range. In terms of price and mix and acquisitions, I think all three of those are going to play a role and it would all be about the same percentage.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Okay. And to look at it yet another way: how would you breakdown sales between market growth and Sherwin just taking market share?", "Chris Connor", "0 for market growth.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Okay.", "Chris Connor", "That will all come from share.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "All right got you then. Maybe Shaun back to you on the tax rate. When I'm looking at these impairment charges: what tax rate should I apply to them for all of '07 and for the quarter as well?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Yes. For all of '07 the impairment, because they have occurred totally in the quarter, I'd would use 35%.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "35%?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Right.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "And: what would you offer us guidance for the tax rate in '08?", "Shaun Hennessy", "What we see as -- Chuck, we have gone from 31 in 2006 to 32.6. We think it will be up slightly from that 32.6 in 2008 and as you probably also noticed we had some wild swings in '06, less than '07, but we believe next year '08 will be fairly stable for that quarters.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "All right. And one last thing, here in Ohio, South Park Mall in Strongsville you had kiosks setup in there. I was wondering that will suite for Sherwin-Williams product, but: what was that design in doing? And: is it more of that going on in the U.S.?", "Chris Connor", "In fact given the sale of the mall", "Bob Wells", "It's winter [tagger[ Chris.", "Chris Connor", "As we would do from time to time across our footprint testing different types of marketing concept. That was a concept to test the implementation of a [color] program in that mall. It was only up during the holiday season.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Okay. And obviously DIY\u2026", "Chris Connor", "Correct.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Saul Ludwig with KeyBanc.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Good morning guys.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Saul.", "Bob Wells", "Good morning, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Well, Shaun, I always have been complaining about high administrative costs and this quarter it has really fumbled down. What is it that gave you the big drop off in the admin expense?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Saul, I don't know if you remember so. You've asked this question a couple of quarters ago and we thought to said that we had some timing changes and really we had forecasted the full year to be up by inflation. I don't know if you remember that.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Right.", "Shaun Hennessy", "At the end of the year, right around 238 versus 230 last year, which is, but it really comes back to the -- in the first three quarters, we had some compensation or other benefit that we are expensing in the first three quarters that went through the P&L in the fourth quarter of last year. From that, you are seeing the flipside of that. So, when you look at the total year, then you see a better picture.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Will 2008 be similar pattern to this year than '07?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Yeah, we believe that the pattern will be the same. But interest expense will be a little higher next year. So, we are expected to be up just slightly more than inflation next year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "And: why did you get a tax credit on writing-off goodwill?", "Shaun Hennessy", "I don't have any answer to that Saul. I will have to get back to you. Because they it depends on, I just remember, we've different sub, so, I'll have to look and then I will get back to you.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "All right. And then perhaps looking at the past two year earnings for 2008 with a weaker start, what is that you expect in the economic environment in the backend of the year to be much better than the first part of the year. What's built into your assumptions from an economic standpoint that supports the strong second half versus the weak first half?", "Bob Wells", "Really nothing Saul and if you think about it kind of the guidance we are giving for the year is that the company is going to be up on the low to mid single for the entire year that's the same guidance we are giving for the first quarter. We are not expecting any kind of economic change in the second half that will elevate revenues and bring us forward.", "I think, what you are seeing in the first half is the impact of the market environment that we are facing. New residential construction is being hardest hit in the southern market and those are typically been the market that have carried us through the first quarter. Additionally, the reasons for acquisitions that we've made tend to be in the northern half of the United States and like we use to operate we didn't make money in the first quarter of our stores.", "So, these are not operating at our pool. Operating profit margin just there will be overtime and so, the combination of those two things are negatively impacting our first quarter. But, we still look back to the kind of earnings leverage that we can get of the stores business through the second and third throughout bring the year end of the numbers that we've given guidance on.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "And in your guidance what else you do with regard to pricing usually in January, you put down a price increase through your system. What was the magnitude of the price increase? And: what you expect let's say uniform material cost to be in '08?", "Chris Connor", "Sure, as I'd be. I'm prepared at this call to give guidance on that and let me start with what we expect the raw material cost increase to be for the industry. As we've always done at this time, we are right now looking at a industry increase of somewhere in the 3% to 6% range that's a little wide than we typically given. But I think it reflects the continued uncertainties that we are seeing out there.", "There are a number of other major global companies, who have on the same calls, we've been talking you about the significant price increases if they are trying to get to the industry and all that work is still on going. But we think that when all set and done, we will be somewhere in that 3% to 6% range on a cost basis.", "Sherwin has taken appropriate pricing actions as we typically do and announce pretty much across all of our segments in the month of December. The range of price increases as we went out would be from a low of 3.5% to a high at 6.5% again depending on the particular business segment that we are operating in and individual product lines within side of those segments. So, 3 to 6 on cost, 3.5 to 6.5 on selling pricing and with that we should be able get through the year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Then so with given that level of pricing you are not counting very much on volume, if the volume is going to be flat to down actually to get to the sales numbers that you projected?", "Chris Connor", "We've just come through a year, where industry volumes and architectural were down high single-digit. We out performed that with a low single-digit volume decline and we are not forecasting much improvement in the market conditions for next year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay. And then finally: what is the share count that you have based into your earning per share guidance assumption?", "Chris Connor", "Well, when you take a look at the fourth quarter, I think, the fourth quarter was right around 127.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "All right.", "Chris Connor", "We got it slightly below that, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan Chase. Please state your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase", "Hi, good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase", "In terms of the demand for the DIY market and I guess the professional contractor: how will you compare the demand characteristics for 2008 from those two groups?", "Chris Connor", "Well, we don't know exactly what it will be like in 2008, but as it follows the trend in 2007 what we've seen Jeff is that the demand on the DIY side has been negative and the demand for professional painting contractors that are focused on the new residential construction market has been negative. That exception the other demand that we've seen for painting contractors and all the other segments, residential repaint property management, commercial painting and industrial maintenance coatings painting have all been positive. We'd expect that same trend to continue in '08.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase", "What's your outlook for industrial maintenance coatings? Is it relatively positive for '08?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase", "And you talked about, I think, in answer to the Saul's question possibly passing through price increases of 3.5% to 6.5% in an environment where the volume characteristics are?", "Chris Connor", "Jeff, it's always a challenge to implement price increases and pass them on. We don't like to do them and our customers don\u2019t like to get them. But the reality of the market is that's the cost environment that we are operating in. Of note, from our analysis the vast majority of all of our competitors have taken very similar pricing actions through the fourth and first quarter of last year and this year. So, we will have those two sessions with our customers throughout the first quarter as we've commented in the past, it takes up a period of time to implement price increase, as we on our particular job. The contractors are still working on it. So, we will have a better feel as the year goes on, how effective it would be the best practices in history or any measure, we would expect to get better than 50% of those prices.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Chris Connor", "Sure, Jeff.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research, please state your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Couple of things, on the gross margin line, you did an impressive job in 2007. The cost environment looks more difficult in '08. What should we be thinking about in terms of the gross margin year-over-year in '08?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Eric, this is Shaun. We were looking at the gross margin. We were looking at it for the full year forecast in a range. And we think that range is not going to be significantly of the $44.9 million that we are able to achieve this year. We don't see it going up or down very significant from that point. But we are comfortable managing the company within a small range around that.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Is the difference this year versus last year? The cost side of the equation that won't allow you to continue to expand gross margins?", "Chris Connor", "Absolutely much more aggressive cost environment that we are facing, if you recall the same call a year ago we were indicating that the industry was going to be flat to up 1% to 2%. And this year, we were right up to that talking 3% to 6%. So, it's a little different environment that we're facing this year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "[Since I] request, I think, you kind of answered this. But I just wanted to be clear that, I understand the sales guidance of 1Q is similar to the full year sales guidance. But earnings are guided effectively down year-over-year in 1Q and going up for the full year. Can you just again explain what that is?", "Chris Connor", "Sure. I'll take another crack at it. If we just look at our Stores segment which is we all know the lion share of our company. The southern divisions and Bob takes you through that on the call in terms of which parts of the Stores Group are performing the best and I think he made the comments that our southeastern division was the first performing of the geographic segments in the Stores division.", "And typically it's been the southeastern division to a lesser extent to the southwestern division carried the company to the first quarter. This is where we have a better weather, flatter sales curve throughout the year and these are the parts of the country that are being impacted the most aggressively in particularly Florida which we've talked about in this call in the past.", "So we are not getting the lift from the southern portions of our Stores segment, early in the year to carry the first quarter. Adding to that, the two acquisitions that we've made this past year are northern type acquisitions. And again they have a more traditional and a profit curve with a second and third quarter or the quarters when they make most of their contribution.", "So we've added a significant number of stores that lost money in the first quarter. So stores that have historically carried up to or something through the market environment and for that reason we guided the first quarter down to expect all those things as they typically would do to catch up in the second and third quarter and that's why we have somewhere between 8% and just below 10% guidance for the year earnings.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Next in terms of the momentum of the business relative to 90 days when we last had a call: have you seen any meaningful change and then what areas of your business?", "Chris Connor", "I don't think we've really seen much of the meaningful change at all. The home building markets continue to deteriorate the fourth quarter. Commercial construction softened and existing turnover really kind of fell off a cliff in the fourth quarter. So if anything some of those metrics worsened for us in the fourth quarter. But when we look at over 2008 and try to make our best estimate of how those things are going to impact us, I think we have given appropriate guidance in the low to mid single-digit sales growth and I believe that we can deliver that.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And then two last questions, you bought 13 million shares in '07: do you think you will buy 13 million in '08?", "Chris Connor", "No.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Why?", "Chris Connor", "Well going into last year if you remember our net debt -- if you take a look at our net debt last year was right around $200 million in the cash and the balance sheet. Our net debt is around $950 million this year. If you take a look at what we've said, our net debt will be around 80 to 85 basis points of our EBITDA for the short term. So that gives us a little less cash this year to work with than it did last year. That's why I don't think we will hit 13 million.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "But you expect that you will still be active?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. If you look historically our track record are much normalized run rate here has been in the 6 million to 8 million shares and this was an opportunity to gear for us given the pricing particularly in the second half and get their other expectations if their stocks are going to come back up.", "Shaun Hennessy", "If you remember in '06, we did buy little over $5 million. So the $5 million plus the $13 million we averaged about a $9 million in the prior year [for around 8].", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And then last question: can you talk about what acquired businesses required the goodwill impairment charge? And: if there are any lessons learned from that experience?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Well I think there is always lesson. I think we've learned lessons from every acquisition. But what we've decided to do is we have no problem telling you which segment they are in, but we are not going to specifically comment on the goodwill from which acquisition.", "On ongoing basis 142 required us to look at the goodwill on our balance sheet on an annual basis, and as the value of those assets change an impairment curves. So, in the future it's hard to forecast but when things occurred in the marketplace and the value of that goodwill changes, we are going to take impairments. So it's hard to forecast, but we're not going to say -- we are not going to identify the acquisition.", "Chris Connor", "I think Eric the FAS 142 ruling here that's applied the cause of this is a much shorter-term look than it has been historically. And while these acquisitions that are suffering have still remained very strategic, appropriate. We are bullish on them. In many regards they continue to meet their pro forma of what our expectations were. They just can't meet the hurdle for this stricter FAS ruling. So we've taken the impairments and we'll continue to do so going forward as John mentioned.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Perfect. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from P. J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please state your question.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Yes. Hi, good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, P.J.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "You talked about cost reductions. Can you talk about which area and can you try to quantify the amount of this cost reductions in '08?", "Chris Connor", "I am sorry the cost reductions in '08?", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Yes.", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. I think, basically when we talk about cost reductions, it's a generic comment P.J. just about looking consistently for those efficiencies either in our manufacturing operations, our supply chain and managing the SG&A at our stores are slightly better.", "None of the expectations or guidance we have given for '08 are built on any significant cost reductions in the business.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Okay. Chris, you talked about commercial construction slowing in your comment. Can you elaborate on that and just tell us how much slowdown are you seeing on the commercial side?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. P.J. we take a look at a number of industry documents and reports that comment on commercial construction growth. We think that last year that commercial construction growth was somewhere between in the mid-to-upper single digit, in terms of construction put in place. And looking forward, the same organizations would indicate that new commercial growth this year will be in the low-to-mid single digit as opposed to the mid-to-upper. So, still positive for the industry, slightly lower than last year's performance.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Okay. And then, if I look at Sherwin-Williams, I mean, it's still a very U.S. centric company. Can you talk about your outlook for M&A outside of the U.S.? Thank you?", "Chris Connor", "Sure. We've consistently share with you that our revenue mix is around 85.15 domestic outside of United States. This past year four of the seven acquisitions that we made were outside of North America. We continue to look in those markets for opportunity to add shareholder value and I expect we will continue to do that going forward.", "One thing we've been consistent about however is that we expect growth to come from all the market we are in including the United States. Certainly we are in a rough market environment, as we stated here today, but our continuing investment in new stores should give confidence that we see as the longer-term opportunity to continue to grow share and revenue in North America.", "We will, from time to time, find opportunities outside of North America and whether that volume mix changes inside our company does not necessarily goal that we have. We are just interested in driving growth; wherever we can find it and investing this money to get the appropriate returns.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Felice with Gabelli & Company. Please state your question.", "Robert Felice with Gabelli & Company", "Hi guys, most of my questions have been answered. Just has a couple of more as the low end of your guidance and also the adjusted $4.78 you earned in 2007 that implies EPS growth for about 4.5% and that the high end about 7.5%. And if then adjust next year for the reduced share count, it really doesn't imply very much leverage from that top line growth to the EBIT line and you've mentioned that you expect gross margins to be roughly stable looking to 2008. And I'm just trying to push through: what's going on? Does that mean that you expect SG&A to be a quite a bit? And I'm just hoping you could delve into why there is not more leverage to the bottom line?", "Chris Connor", "I think that I really didn't don't want to go down the whole P&L here. We don't usually do that. But, when you take a look at the SG&A, our SG&A, we had a fairly good year. But when you continue to go through for another year we've got a couple of things that are going on. In total, we expect our SG&A as a percent of sales to go up, with the sales increase, with the diminishing returns and savings that you can continue to get out of SG&A.", "I mentioned our debt is going to be higher this year for our interest is going to be up. I understand the shares will be accretive, but the interest will also will be dilutive. So, when you talk about the leverage on there, we've talked in the past of how much the sales had to increase perhaps to get leverage. Totally, when you look at our full year sales, we've to realize there is acquisitions and there are also the annualization acquisitions and yeah I mean: we are at the point where it's tough for us to get leverage, and that's why our SG&A will go up as a percent of sales.", "Robert Felice with Gabelli & Company", "Okay, fair enough. And then just looking at the pricing you mentioned earlier the 3.5% to 6.5% you mentioned that you'll probably get about half of that in the rolling throughout the year which would suggest to me that maybe you get 2%, 2.5% price. Your raw's are going to be up 3% to 6% as you said, which would suggest there is some pressure on gross margin, yet you expect them to be relatively flat. So, maybe you could just push through that and kind of dwell into: where the offsetting factor maybe?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. Our raw material cost represents about 50% of the average selling price in our industry for a gallon of paint. So, we need an effective 3% selling price increase to offset a 6% cost increase. So, when you do the math and the numbers you just referenced that brings you to about a flat margin.", "Robert Felice with Gabelli & Company", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then I guess, lastly I was hoping you could dwell into I guess the underlying economic assumptions around your guidance of $5 to $5.15: what that really implies about I guess the state of North America and the rest of the world? And as you look out today relative to those underlying assumptions: what could cause things to come in better or worse than you expect?", "Chris Connor", "I think, the assumptions that we are making in giving that guidance are widely recognized and known. Again to the earlier question regarding our dominance in North America and of course the on going impact of a housing market and this particularly rising raw material, so we have a number of head wins that we will be facing going into it.", "The obvious answer to what things could change that would impact this number would be if those markets were to come back a quicker. We've long thoughts about existing home turnover market is being better a correlation than existing our new home construction and this was a very tough year for that I think.", "Some reports have commented it was the sharpest declines since the depression and the worst housing markets since that period of time. So were we to see existing home sales hit bottom sometime during earlier half of the year and then bounce off that bottom. That could have a positive impact on the company's performance. But I think it would be inappropriate and premature on this call to give that kind of guidance or expect that to happen.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Gregg Goodnight with UBS. Please state your question.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Good morning all.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Gregg.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Did I miss that that you gave some interest guidance for 2008?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, but I'll give it you. If you take a look at our interest this year was up about $14 million from the prior year. I am not talking about interest, I am talking about interest expense plus income.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "All right.", "Sean Hennessy", "As income. And so when you take a look at the next year I believe it's going to be up slightly more than that.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Okay. Up an additional $14 million?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yeah. A little higher than that, yes.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Okay. Next question. Did you breakdown your expectations for '08 for the Paint store in terms of same store sales growth versus overall revenue growth?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, we did not. We'll comment looking backwards on comp store performance, but we have not commented looking forward. And as you know this last year, our comp stores were negative 1.1%.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Right. Do you think 2008 will be higher or lower than that number or?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think we are giving guidance that we're expecting the markets in our sales and all the pieces and parts to be very similar to this year.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Okay. Next question if I could and this may be something I also missed. I understood the reevaluation and the charge you took was $11 million pre-tax in the Global Group and $ $4 million in the Paint Store Group. Is that correct?", "Chris Connor", "$4 million was in our Consumer Group.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Consumer, okay. That's what I missed. Okay. And in terms: generically, the Global Group, I guess you are not going to give us some guidance in term exactly: why you had to take that reevaluation?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, I mean we basically said that the goodwill that we have on our book when we did the 142 testing show that the value of the assets on our books were lower than what originally had a year ago. So, that difference goes to the P&L as an impairment. We are just following 142. But the guidance we are not going to give specifically point out which are the acquisitions as the goodwill occurred that we bought.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Okay. And that's all I have. Thanks Chris.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Gregg.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Stephen O'Neil with Hilliard Lyons. Please state your question.", "Stephen O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning Steve.", "Stephen O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "Just wondered: if you could elaborate little bit on the causes for the acquisitions dilution? And I guess: what steps you take this year and maybe next year to make these acquisitions accretive? Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Yea. I think when you take a look at the -- in general when we've said that we are going to be flat to down slightly with the acquisitions, I think it goes back to something that Chris said. These acquisitions are in northern part of the county. So, timing wise and as we get the saving, if you think about the going through the different cycles, the economic cycle, and when you are going through a tougher cycle that we are going right now, where our sales are not as strong and the increases are not as strong as we originally thought as we think about this four to five years ago doing an acquisitions.", "The acquisitions we were able to do were accretive basically in the second quarter that we owned them. This is just taking longer. We are still getting the savings. We've looked at the SG&A. We've looked at systems. We've looked at the raw materials. We've looked at the manufacturing, rationalization and the synergies. We feel pretty good about the synergies and so forth.", "It's just that the sales are not being coming as strong. And so the sales, the margins increase has been good just with the sales decreases. It just they are not as accretive as quick.", "Chris Connor", "", "And I'd comment and add to that, Steve that when you look at the basket of acquisitions we've made this year. The two big ones, where we used to store acquisitions and we commented on and as Shaun is said in the past -- for us to get leverage on the earning side we don't need to be running these comp stores somewhere in the 3% range, plus or minus a few points.", "And from the last question from Gregg, we've made the comments on comps were down last year one, one and these businesses are not significantly different. So, it's being difficult for us to get that leverage. Again we've made these acquisitions on a longer term basis. This is a business that we have great confidence in. We got good brands with excellent people and great customer relationships and it just going to take a little bit longer from a market timing standpoint to get into where will be contributing at the level we expected.", "Stephen O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Lewittes with JL Advisors. Please state your question.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Couple of questions have you noticed any difference since Axel bought Imperial and how Imperial is competing I know it's the acquisition just closed, so if you have any or do you anticipate any difference on the competitive landscape?", "Bob Wells", "", "Michael, we have not seen any significant change in the strategy and I think it's too earlier and inappropriate for me to comment what they might do.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay. And then maybe on this when you are doing a legal overview, but: is there anything still going on at Wisconsin?", "Chris Connor", "The two cases in Wisconsin have gone to trial. One is the city of Milwaukee case, which was the public nuisance case. The other was the Steven Thomas case, the personal injury case both were decided by a jury for the defendant.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay.", "Chris Connor", "I don't know the status of any appeal in those cases of top of my head. I understand that there maybe additional personal injury plaintiffs but I don't believe any trial dates have been set for any of those cases.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay. And then before, when you were talking about buyback, I mean, you are talking about how many shares you have averaged just because the stock is down so much. I guess my question is how much is the dollar amount: how much is left on the buyback right now? And: what's the dollar amount that you've been averaging in terms of your buyback?", "Chris Connor", "When you take a look at the authorization we have from the Boards of Directors, we currently have 27 million shares left from the authorization of 30 million that they gave us in October.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay.", "Chris Connor", "We take a look at it, I can't comment for prior years but last year we averaged around $63 as we were buying throughout the year. But unfortunately it's a blackout that's when the stock really dropped. But so the average was right around $63 last year but I don't remember the prior years.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay. And then just in regard to price increase could you talk a little bit: how does that work in terms of implementing a price increase? Do you do it nationally everywhere at the same time? Is it rolled out regionally at different times? Can you just talk about: how it actually goes into effect and over what time period until that is put into effect?", "Chris Connor", "All of our business segments, as we commented and announced pricing actions in the fourth quarter of the year.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "All at the same time or throughout the fourth quarter.", "Chris Connor", "No not all at the same time. All during the month of December, all was different implementation rollout scheduled. And depending on whether this is a business that we sell through our own company owned stores or whether it's coating that we sell through other retailing partners or whether it's products that we sell through distributors they will then sell into those markets.", "So, all of those factors play a role, and I think the guidance we've given is that as the year goes through we will be implementing those and effectively gaining as much of the price increases we can. I don't think we would comment specifically on which customers or business segments took which price increases in which month.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "In terms of your own stores you put the price increase in at all the same time?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Throughout the country.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay. And are you assuming this wasn't clear to me, is there -- the December price increase, are you assuming that an additional '08 price increase on top of that in your own stores?", "Chris Connor", "No. The price increase that was announced in December is the only pricing that we are talking about and that's what we have playing on these numbers.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay. And in '07, was there only one price increase? How many price increases traditionally in the last couple of years have you had or is it just one per year?", "Chris Connor", "Typically, we go out with one price action a year. We have in periods of aggressive raw material going on twice. '07 was a period, when we went out one time and as we've commented we've announced just for one for '08.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "And was there, did your competitors follow you in December?", "Chris Connor", "No. We don't comment on who's leading and who's following. I think it's a rational industry, people buying from the same raw material suppliers. We intended to go out for pricing when we need to regardless of whether we were following or leading.", "Michael Lewittes - JL Advisors", "Okay. Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky with FTN Midwest Research. Please state your question.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Well, I got follow-up guys and looking at the rough operating environment, how you are thinking about the acquisition market. Do you think it will be better buying opportunity and are you trying to keep the balance sheet in shape for that relative to, sounding like you have a lower appetite for stock repo for this year?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, I think Chuck the environment fairly close to it what it was a year ago. I think that there possible could be some later expectations between buyers and sellers this year versus last year. And our balance sheet, yeah, we are trying to feel that our balance sheet is an asset that we can use and if the right acquisition comes up, we will go for it and of that with the cash generation that we'll have in general from our operations, I don't feel it came down as debt. If we do get an opportunity, we will buy stock and we will of an acquisition, Chuck.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "All right. And then on working capital last year Shaun let me just some quick calculations here and it was up, it looks like you, yours about $105 million of net working capital. How much of that, which you say just high raw material cost?", "Shaun Hennessy", "Actually the biggest factor of that was acquisition Chuck. If you take a look at..", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "That's right okay.", "Shaun Hennessy", "If you take a look at inventory and receivables without acquisitions, both numbers were down. The absolute numbers were down. The other factor was our payables were down. And so, and as we putting in system and we were working through a few things and that will happen next year. But when you take a look at it, raw materials, I was saying had a very small effect on us and we were able to get the inventory down for the year without acquisitions.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Research", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Saul Ludwig with KeyBanc. Please state your question.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Just quickly, how much did you spent in the fourth quarter for share buyback?", "Chris Connor", "Saul, it was in the neighborhood, I don\u2019t give the exact number but I think the number was about $3 million and the average selling purchase price was right around $60, so probably $180 million.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay.", "Chris Connor", "Plus or minus five, ten", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "What the dilution from the acquisitions you said that it cost you for Chuck's questions, this question before $11 million, which was about $0.06 share and then you said that you were anticipating.", "Chris Connor", "In the Stores group.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "It would be neutral or maybe $0.02 dilutive will that be an incremental of the $0.02 dilution meaning a negative swing of $0.02 or what it means $0.02 rather than $0.06 which would constitute a favorable swing of $0.04 possibly interpret your commentary?", "Chris Connor", "It's four.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "It's what?", "Chris Connor", "Favorable four.", "Bob Wells", "Favorable four.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay. So, it would be plus in that sense.", "Chris Connor", "Right. The absolute number is zero to $0.02.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Got you. So, that would constitute as part of your positive swing in your earnings that you are looking up this year versus last year?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. ", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Okay. And then also you commented that in your consumer business your manufacturing team did a great job of holding down cost in an environment where they produce fewer gallons. Can I squeeze it some more or you sort of at the end of the line with regard to product manufacturing efficiencies?", "Chris Connor", "You know what Saul we are not looking for the repeat in the reduction of our variable cost next year. We think that I mean they are going to continue to look but we think that there is going to be really not much difference. You also have to remember, we put in an new plant last year that currently plant which was really productive compared to the Oakwood plant that we closed. So, that help us but I don't see the big increase this year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Great, thank you guys.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks very much.", "Bob Wells", "But actually other things I'll tell you is that they did a great job again the inventory down in the fourth quarter which will help us in 2008 because we didn't put that dividend on our balance sheet.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc", "Great, good point. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Gregg Goodnight with UBS.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "A question in terms of you are continuing to open them 2% to 3% more paint stores which will be about a 100 stores again this year, can you comment on doing that in the down market? And the second question is will you get any cannibalization of your existing store sales through opening new paint stores?", "Chris Connor", "Hey Gregg we have had a long history here of taking a longer view of the store model. And I think as we've shared with you and other investors that we see a 4,000 stores being an appropriate target for us to shoot for. In doing real estate as we've commented the vast majority of this deals are leasehold situations and in the down market that's a great time to be out negotiating for rents and securing longer term rents.", "So, we have stayed and through cycle like this in the past on past year we are adding new stores. As you can imagine the stores that we are going to be opening in the first half of this year were all negotiated and concluded last year, this is what continue to work this year and stores that we will open in 2009, so this is a long term strategy that will say the course.", "We have not commented on this call about cannibalization, when we give our account store numbers we've always had to deal for the fact that we have opened the store account that business does migrate from existing stores to our new stores. But those trends lines won't change dramatically from the way they've been performing for the last decade.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Okay. Very thanks for that answer.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from [Joseph Falouskey] with Credit Suisse. Please state your question?", "Joseph Falouskey - Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking my call. I wanted to ask just a clarify number you mentioned it earlier that 3% to 6% decrease is that your expectation for overall North American industry volumes for 2008?", "Chris Connor", "The 3% to 6% number I recall giving on the call was about raw material cost increase for the industry. In terms of volume industry decrease in North America, we did comment that last year the industry saw architecturally about an 8% volume decline. We've not given guidance and while we expect the industry to remain backwards in volume for 2008.", "Joseph Falouskey - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And finally with your historical price increases, have you been able to get 100% or close to what you seek?", "Chris Connor", "We've never received 100%. There has been times we've been in the high 80s, close to 90, when it typical it's right around the 80%.", "Joseph Falouskey - Credit Suisse", "Terrific. Well, thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Diego. I'll close this morning by asking you all to the save the date of Tuesday, June 24th on your calendar that's the day we will host our annual financial community presentation at our headquarters in Cleveland. The morning program will be followed by a reception and lunch, where you have an opportunity to meet with our operating level management and after lunch we have scheduled a brief technology tour at our Greentech center down the hill from our headquarters.

Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning everyone, welcome to our first-quarter earnings conference call. Bill Mansfield, our Chairman, President and CEO; and Lori Walker, our Treasurer and Controller are with me on our call this morning. A couple of brief comments before we begin. First, I would direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning, which contains much of the information that we\u2019ll be covering in the call. Also a reminder that in our comments this morning we\u2019ll be making statements that reflect our current use and estimates about future performance and financial results and that these comments are based on certain assumptions and expectations, that are subject to risk and uncertainties.

Bill will comment on our outlook for the rest of the year and then we will get to your questions.", "We turned in a good performance for the first quarter, essentially our results were in line with our expectations. First quarter sales totaled $765.1 million, up 10.2% from last year, driven by growth in our packaging, industrial and architectural product lines and the performance of acquisitions. Adjusted for currency and acquisitions, sales were up 3.6%. Net income for the quarter was $24 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.24 for the quarter, which excludes a non-cash adjustment of $0.03 per share for Huarun minority interest shares. Reported earnings per share were $0.21. In 2007, first-quarter net income was $23.6 million or adjusted earnings per share of $0.23, which excluded a $0.05 per share non-cash adjustment for Huarun minority interest shares. In addition, last year's results included a $0.01 per share gain for favorable tax adjustments. So, excluding the adjustments for Huarun minority interest shares, and the 2007 favorable tax adjustments, the underlying EPS comparison for the first quarter is $0.22 per share in 2007 and $0.24 per share in 2008 or growth of 9.1%. Our gross margin was 27.5% in the first quarter, down from 28.7% in the first quarter of 2007. The decrease is due to the fact that most of our price increases have been implemented since January 1st, and have not been in place long enough to offset recent raw material cost increases. We expect that our price increases will significantly narrow this GAAP for the year.", "Operating expenses were 20.3%, down 1% from 21.3% in 2007. A result of good control on expenses and we are also getting leverage from acquisition revenues. The tax rate for the first quarter was 34.5%, this compares with 30.8% in the first quarter of 2007 and we benefited from a tax rate reduction in the Netherlands. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be 33.5% to 34%. This is up slightly from the 33.5% rate we discussed in our year-end call and is a result of our implementation of FIN 48. We repurchased 750,000 shares in the quarter. Average shares outstanding in the quarter were down 2.6 million from a year ago with the decline related to the 7,50,000 shares we repurchased during the first quarter of this year and 2.596 million shares that we repurchased last year. Average shares outstanding were 101 million for the first quarter and are projected to be approximately the same for the second quarter. Recapping our sales performance for the quarter, our core growth defined as volume price mix, was some 3.6% with majority of this being volume growth. Currency added 4.2% and acquisitions added another 2.4%, for total growth of 10.2% in the quarter. Looking at our segment results, paint sales increased 4.1% and were up low single digit when adjusted for currency and acquisitions. Architectural sales have shown improvement since the first half of 2007, but the improvement is primarily a result of new business. Demand in the architectural coatings market remains weak. Our Coatings segment sales increased 14.3% and were up mid-single digit when adjusted for currency and acquisitions.", "Sales performance in both our packaging and industrial product lines was good with packaging in particular showing excellent strength. Sales in our other category, which includes resins, colorants, gelcoats, and our furniture repair business increased 3.9%, up about 1% when adjusted for currency and acquisitions. Turning to EBIT margins for the quarter by segment, our Paint segment EBIT margin was 8%, down from 8.9% in 2007. Our Coatings segment EBIT margin was 8.3% for the quarter, down 0.1% from 8.4% in the first quarter of 2006\u2026 sorry, 2007. The EBIT margin for our other category, which includes our corporate expenses was negative 8.1% compared with negative 8.7% last year. And our total company EBIT margin for the quarter was 6.8% down from 7% in 2007.", "Moving to the balance sheet, total debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.104 billion, up $87 million from the end of last fiscal year due mainly to acquisitions and share repurchases. We are estimating that year-end debt for fiscal year 2008 will be $950... I am sorry $930 million to $950 million, and this assumes no additional acquisitions and no additional share repurchases. Just a brief comment about the impact of the Aries acquisition on the first quarter. Due to the one-month lag in reporting international result, first quarter sales included only about $3 million of Aries sales and a slight operating loss. In addition, interest expense included about $0.5 million for Aries. While we expect Aries to be accretive this year, it was modestly dilutive to first quarter EPS. Continuing on our balance sheet, our total debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the third quarter was 44.4%, with net debt-to-capital 42.4%. Capital spending in the first quarter was $8.6 million, down from $12.4 million in the first quarter of 2007, and our forecast for capital spending for the full year is approximately $60 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $19.5 million, up from $16.7 million in the first quarter of 2007. Our full year forecast for depreciation and amortization is approximately $80 million. So with these comments on the numbers, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Paul and good morning everyone. We are pleased with the quarter. The Valspar employees including our management team did a good job in delivering on our expectations. Our international performance, our core growth, our new business generation, gains from our recent acquisitions, and prudent management of expenses have combined to give us a good start to the year. The performance of our global packaging business was strong with sales for the quarter up mid teens following high single-digit improvement in 2007. Our strong technology base combined with a global reach of this business are the primary drivers of the growth. New business gains across our U.S. Coil U.S. General Industrial and our US Architectural business offset weaknesses in the US markets. Year-over-year volume in our architectural business increased due to new home center store growth, new business from line extensions and product programs, both of which are result of our branding initiatives.", "Overall, our U.S. sales were up low single digits. International sales for the quarter increased 20% and accounted for nearly 45% of total company sales.", "Looking ahead, as you saw in our press release, we continue to expect our earnings for the year to be in the $1.65 to $1.75 per share range. We believe the company is well positioned to deliver our expected results for the balance of 2008. Our businesses are focused on new business generation, operational excellence and productivity improvements through our global Lean Six Sigma initiative. We expect raw material increases in the 3% to 5% range and are implementing price increases in all of our business to offset these cost increases. We believe the architectural paint market in the U.S. declined by approximately 8% last year, last year being calendar 2007. We have incorporated a similar market performance in our planning for 2008 and this is reflected in our guidance. We will have lower brand spending this year because the cost of creating, staffing, and initiating the program are behind us. We will see a $10 million reduction from last year\u2019s spend.", "Acquisition performance, which includes our recent Teknos in Finland and the Aries transaction announced today are expected to be slightly accretive for 2008. We've taken advantage of the recent downward movements in interest rates and assuming we repurchase the 3,250,000 shares available under our current authorization, we expect our interest expense for 2008 to be 5% to 10% below 2007. In December, our Board of Directors approved a 7.7% increase in our dividend, the 30th straight year of dividend increases for our shareholders.", "Finally, I would like to say a few words about our December acquisition of the Aries business in Mexico. Aries is a market-leading manufacturer of high-performance coatings for both the coil and the packaging markets. This transaction is similar to other strategic acquisitions we've made and that it increases our geographic diversity and improves the balance of our portfolio. Just as important are the synergies we expect to achieve as a result of combining the Aries business with our existing operations in Mexico.", "And with those comments, I'll now open up the call for your questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Operator Instructions]. One moment for the first question. We do have a question from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, David.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Bill, what was the gap in between prices and raw materials in Q1?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Most of our pricing, David, went into effect in January and there will be further pricing that goes into effect as we move through the second quarter. So, if you recall, our months are November, December, January. So, we saw de minimus impact of our pricing in our first quarter results.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Do you have a number, [inaudible] what that gap was in Q1?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Maybe a couple of percent.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And the gains in packaging, very strong in Q1. Is that sustainable for the year and what's really driving those gains on the top line?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, number one, yes I believe it is sustainable. Number two, as I said in my comments what\u2019s driving it is our technology, particularly our water based technology as a lot of our customers look to sustainability and green issues. Our water-based technology is a perfect solution for those kinds of challenges and we're seeing\u2026 we're seeing that technology penetrate not only in the U.S but also in Europe, South Africa, Asia, around the globe.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "And lastly, the M&A pipeline post-Aries. How does it look for the rest of the year?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there is always\u2026 there is always deals to be looked at. But, quite frankly David, at today's share price, I'm more inclined to acquire Valspar's stock.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Bob Koort, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead?", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. This is Emily Jean [ph], sitting for Bob. Two question, the first question is related to the Coatings business. The momentum obviously looked pretty strong during the quarter, and then driven by packaging and industrial coatings. Can you just give us a little bit more color on the performance of the General Industrial, Coil and the Wood Coating? And also what's your outlook for this Industrial Coating division within the context of a potential economic recession in the U.S going forward?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me comment first on the three businesses you mentioned. In both our General Industrial and Coil business, we benefited in the first quarter from several things. One is our global presence and the growth that we're able to generate outside the U.S, our acquisitions and inside the US from new business generation. With respect to our wood business, that business is one that has been negatively impacted in 2007 by the downturn in housing. And I would tell you that, we would have similar comments on our Wood Coatings' business as I had in my opening remarks with respect to architectural, in that we do not see any improvement in the wood coatings market in 2008. Going forward, with respect to our Industrial businesses, General Industrial and Coil, we certainly hear and read the same things that you're commenting on with respect to slowdown. We had a good quarter, we did not see that manifested in our business and I think one of the reasons is the high success we've had in generating new business. But, we are concerned going forward relative to what I would tell you is the health of the core business in the US for both General Industrial and Coil. But, have also incorporated those concerns into our guidance for 2008.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay great. And then my second question is related to the, Reyelts pricing and volume dynamics that you're pushing off pretty aggressive pricing to offset a high raw materials cost going forward, but, you also expect a further demand and weakness in the US paint markets. So, can you help me understand the pricing and the volume dynamics for your paint business over the next maybe several quarters? Although you have to give up some thin volumes for pricing. So, and then helpfully that pricing will have some impact, some positive impact on margin, thin margins?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Pricing is always an interesting conversation with customers, but there are some overriding economics when crude oil is up $20 a barrel year-over-year and the global supply and demand situation on a number of materials is snug. Our customers have some understanding of those dynamics. We expect that we will be able to recover our raw material cost in 2008 from the 3% to 5% projection that I made. I think this issue of traling [ph] off volume, I think that was the word that you used. That's an almost customer-by-customer, market-by-market situation and I really don't have any overall comments about that.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "Hi. Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "Hi. A couple of things. I guess I am surprised that your operating profit in paints is down because titanium dioxide prices were down and acrylic's pricing aren't going anywhere and epoxies price increases have sort of stalled and you've got relatively good volume. So, why are operating profits down?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "One of the dynamics that\u2019s operating in paints, Jeff is, in our automotive refinish business, particularly in Europe last year, the market was going through a change from solvent base to water base and there was a... we had a big first quarter as a result of customers buying in solvent based inventory because if they had it in their operations they could continue to use it even after the regulation went into effect. And so we had an extraordinary first quarter last year with respect to our solvent based automotive refinish sales in Europe and now this is the first quarter \u201908 and we are selling water based products and we are not... obviously quarter-over-quarter had a drop in that business.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "Okay. That's helpful. So domestic paints is holding in there?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It is, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "What is the cash flow from operations and the CapEx for the quarter?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Well we don't have our cash flow statement done yet because we announced results within two weeks of the end but it should be up significantly from last year. Our EBITDA is also up a fair amount because of the amount of depreciation we had in the quarter relative to what we had last year, but we don't have that number, Jeff. As we soon as we have it we will be glad to get it to you.", "Lori A. Walker - Vice President, Treasurer and Controller", "And CapEx for the quarter, Jeff, was $8.6 million.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "$8.6 million. Last year you spent a lot to do your promotions at Lowe's. Was there a reasonable benefit in the current quarter?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "On a percent basis, Jeff, in my opinion on a percent basis the number is misleading because it is down about 30%. But I got to try it on a dollars basis, it's maybe down by $0.5 million to $1 million. Most of the benefit on the branding we should see in the second half of the year, the branding reduction.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "We didn't have media spending in the first quarter last year, it didn't start I think until the second quarter.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "What about incentive comp this year? Is it going... is it likely to be up or down versus last year, is that change meaningful?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "We hope up a lot.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have reasonable incentive compensation build into our guidance, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "Reasonable incentive comp. Lastly, so, can you explain to me again why raw materials should be up 3% to 5% this year?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "3% to 5% is our forecast. There has... there was some movement in December and January. I think our forecast is frankly consistent with the other major coatings companies. Now do I think it has the potential to change on a dynamics basis, yes, perhaps.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome. Jeff.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Don Carson, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning this is Adam Milkovich [ph] in for Don Carson. How are you doing?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Adam.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was wondering, two questions on the margin lines. One, the gross margin and the SG&A as a percent of sales. Do you think that this 100 basis point decline in SG&A as a percent of sales is a level that is sustainable over the course of the year or will that narrow as well with seasonality over time? And then the second question, given the delay in pricing versus the raw material movement in the first quarter of '08, do you think that the '07 margins towards the back half of this year are achievable or will you probably remain a little behind them due to the dynamics of cost increases and price realizations? Thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me start with the margin question first, I think that or not... I think, our expectation is that we\u2019ll be reasonably close to the prior year margins through the second, third, and fourth quarter.", "Lori A. Walker - Vice President, Treasurer and Controller", "And Adam, on your question on SG&A, yes, I think that that will narrow too, over the course of the year, that gap will narrow.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And maybe on the international, now that they are 40%, 50% of sales, do they have a different margin profile from the U.S. business? I think we've talked about in the past about being slightly different. I was wondering if that might be true still?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it is. Our U.S. margins are typically higher than our... on an operating margin basis, they are typically higher than those outside the U.S. And that would also be true for international gross margins also.", "Unidentified Analyst", "All right, thank you guys.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mike Hamilton, RBC Dain. Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Mike.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Mike.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Bill, first of all, could you give a little bit of picture of what you are seeing in the Architectural in terms of the assessment of customer inventory position and expectation of play out here and the seasonal strengths?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think the inventories are in reasonably good shape relative to demand. Certainly they are... historically there been a pick up in business as our customers prepare and build their inventories for the spring and summer painting season. And I would expect we'll see that same dynamic play out.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "If you recall that, that pick up was delayed about a month last year.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "But that... we haven't seen that delay this year it\u2019s... but I would tell you on an overall basis, it would appear to us that our customers\u2019 inventories are in pretty good shape.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Thanks. And then if we could shift gears, your assessment of what you're seeing out of Huarun and kind of tactically what you're trying to accomplish here in '08?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in the case of Huarun, they had a good first quarter, and they continue on their performance track of double-digit sales and profit growth. Certainly we are making some good progress in the architectural paint area with the Huarun brand and we are quite pleased with that. So far the wood coatings business of Huarun does has... hasn't been affected anywhere near the amount that the wood coatings business in the U.S. has been impacted. Looking forward, we expect Huarun to deliver another good year in 2008. The recent headlines about winter weather certainly could have an impact in our second quarter. However, I think that most of those weather problems occurred around Chinese New Year and for all intents and purposes we do de minimus business in China around the Chinese New Year holidays. So, we don't think that impact will be too significant.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Then finally anything on the cross-marketing side there in terms of product initiatives coming from Valspar operations into China?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We're still making progress on the automotive refinish area, which we are pleased with. We are still taking advantage of the Huarun manufacturing infrastructure to continue to optimize our other businesses in China, non-Huarun businesses in China in terms of cost structure. And the Huarun management team continue to take more and more responsibility for Valspar Asia business, which we are pleased with also.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Thank you, Bill, that\u2019s it for me.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Mike.", "Operator", "Next question is from Saul Ludwig, KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks. Bill, I'm glad to hear about the new business, could you add little more color on that, say on architectural. Where... where we now find Valspar product that we didn't find it before, and in non-architectural area what was the type of new business that you obtained?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in the case of architectural, we were successful in placing additional Cabot brand product into the box channel. Cabot interior which we're pleased with and there were a number of other Valspar branded products also placed in the big box. We started to ship those during our first quarter and we would expect to ship some additional here in the beginning of the second quarter. So, in architectural that was the primary...", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "There is more business with Lowe\u2019s in the interior Cabot brand and other Valspar products there.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We also made some in-roads in our consumer brands to sell, in our dealers business with additional penetration with the Cabot brand.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, great. And then the other segments?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, on the other segments... we have two issues with the new business generation. One is new business outside the U.S. some of which is a function of market growth because we are positioned in some fast-growing markets, which we are pleased with. I'm particularly pleased, as I said in my comments, with the packaging business that really is a statement to the strength of that businesses\u2019 technology. And when we're looking at the U.S. economy back last year and planning for 2008, we put a lot emphasis and\u2026 on generating new business because where we were unsure as to what was going to be the state of affairs of core business in a slowing U.S. economy and I think that's a good strategy and it's a strategy that clearly has paid off for us in the first quarter of 2008.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "In the packaging business, where you said you were up mid-double digits, was... was there any acquisitions in there or that was just core of packaging business was up say 15%?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No acquisitions. So that was pure organic one.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Do you think that pace is going to continue for the best of the year?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, some of it is clearly currency. There is some currency because it's a global business and so I think the currency piece would probably slowdown through the year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And the raw materials, was there any increase which you say from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, were they pretty level?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, Saul January 1, our fourth quarter to our first quarter is probably not the right issue. The chemical industry still operates on calendar quarters and we did see some increase in our material cost January 1.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "So for the quarter, it'll be pretty modest.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And Huarun, how much do you have revenues increased year-over-year?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Saul, it\u2019s probably around 10%.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Is that consistent with the pace you've expected or is that moderating a bit though?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "No it was exactly what we expected, it was consistent with our expectations.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Very good thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Saul, one more, let me go back to something. On the raw material cost, I want to clarify my comment, certainly we saw January 1 which was\u2026 which we only had a month... but we already... what we saw also was moment from last October that did affect our entire quarter in the first quarter.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "What's your estimate that increase might have been, Bill?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That could have been 1% or 2% back in October.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And then back\u2026 you mentioned that the core business of volume price and mix was up 3.6% in the quarter that you said Paul and you said most of that was volumes, does that mean\u2026 should we interpret that something like 2% to 3% of it was volume?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "That's exactly right.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Great thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome Saul.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Steve Schwartz First Analyst. Please go ahead.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Hi, good morning everyone.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Paul did you say acquisition contributed 2.4% in the quarter?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "To that, for some reasons that sounds low to me, it was three... you got 3 million form this latest Aries acquisition and I think Technos... and Technos was also in there as well. So is there something going on that you only got like $5 million from on the top line from acquisition?", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "That doesn't sound right, that math doesn\u2019t sound right.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay.", "Lori A. Walker - Vice President, Treasurer and Controller", "It's definitely more than that.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "2.4%, last year sales were...", "Lori A. Walker - Vice President, Treasurer and Controller", "694.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay, 7.", "Lori A. Walker - Vice President, Treasurer and Controller", "So it is counted as $16.5 million, $17 million.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. That sounds right. You're right. You got me there then. Okay.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Phew.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "I'll go back. Question number one. So, in the industrial, you were doing a plant downsizing.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "And we're still seeing EBIT margins in Coatings down slightly year-over-year. Can we expect to see an improvement there from the downsizing going forward?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know if it's from the downsizing. I think going forward, with respect to the dynamic of pricing and raw-material, leverage from... on the SG&A line from acquisition impact. I think they will be more meaningful input into the operating margins.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. And then in Europe, mixed signals from what's happening there with the economy. Are you seeing any impact at this point downward, I think so on sideways, what's your view?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our biggest business in Europe is our packaging, can coatings business. And that business has historically, ever since I've been involved in, which is 30 years has performed consistent through the ups and downs of the economic cycle. I think for us it's too early to call us to whether we're seeing any pronounced weakness in Europe outside of our can coatings business, which is as I said has performed very well.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "One moment please, for the next question. The next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn. Please go ahead. Please announce your company name sir.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Longbow Research. Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Lot of my questions have been answered. I guess, the one question that I still have around pricing. You talked about implementing some price increases effective January 1st. Should we assume that most of this is in the industrial sector, perhaps a little bit in packaging and very little in architectural or are you able to get business or price increases across-the-board?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our pricing initiatives are across all the business, across-the-board and across the globe. That's really about all I could say with respect to that.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. Is it... are we likely to see more success in the industrial side than in the architecture inside, or do you think you'll be pretty successful in the architectural site as well?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's another... Dmitry it's another way of asking that same question, which I really am reluctant at this point to comment on.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. All right. Fair enough. You talked about the fact that, not the fact but your opinion that given the current price of the stock and where you are in the acquisition pipeline that you're likely to, more likely to spend the cash on buying back shares than in making acquisitions. As we look towards the second half of the year and you kind of work through your remaining... I think it's 3 million shares or so that you have outstanding under this current authorization. Should we expect to see another authorization come along that that's a little bit more meaningful in size. Because even if your stock rebounds materially, I can argue that it\u2019s still significantly undervalued even in the mid-20s. And I'm assuming we would want to continue to buy the shares at that price. So should we see a more meaningful share repurchases given that you are still generating pretty strong cash and the markets is not rewarding you for the resiliency of the company?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Well as you know, we traditionally have had, well, every year for the last 15 or 20 years, we have had an authorization in October. We are a little bit in a situation where we can't pre-judge what the Board would decide. I think it's possible that the Board would decide to move in the direction you just indicated but we will just have to wait and see.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, Paul. Thank you. And then just a final, a more strategic question, with the large deals happening in the.... particularly in architectural paint side, but in coating industry in general, you have done a couple of smaller deals obviously expanding your geographic reach, which given your North American centric business model was probably a good thing to do to get more international. But are you looking at larger deals? Do you feel that there is some pressure on you to do a larger deal just because of the way the market has consolidated or are you going to remain disciplined and continue to look at more of bolt-ons and technology acquisitions rather than just pure size or reach?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Number one, I do not feel any pressure whatever to do a large deal. I think that our... I think our acquisition strategy, which has been highly focused and as you point out has been for intents and purposes other than Huarun a bolt-on strategy has served us very well. And we would expect to continue to participate in the market in that way. That is not to say however that if a compelling proposition came along that we felt was good for shareholders that was larger than the size of the deals we have done over the last four years, we'd certainly consider it. However, in today's marketplace, and today's world, I think our strategy has been a perfect strategy and has worked very well for us.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "All right. Well, thank you. It's difficult to argue with success. Thank you guys.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Dmitry.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of PJ. Juvekar, Citibank. Please go ahead.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Yes, good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Bill, you mentioned that industry volumes in architectural were down 8% last year, can you give us what was the comparable number for you?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Our volumes were not down 8%.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Were they down half of that? I mean just give us a ballpark number.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "They were down somewhere between 0% to 4%.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Okay. And is that what is built in for '08 in your forecast?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "In '08 there is a number dynamics. Number one, that as I mentioned in my opening comments, that we think the market will perform similar in '08 as it did in '07, but we have a number of other different dynamics that go into our business model. As I mentioned, new store growth, some new business penetrations as a result of branding and I am reluctant to talk specifically about that\u2026 those assumptions or what they ended up being other than to say we think we took pretty conservative view in our guidance for our architectural business in 2008.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Okay. And Bill, I think few months ago you had talked about seeing some signs of commercial slowdown following the residential slowdown, can you update us on what you are seeing right now in commercial side?.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You know it's a mixed, we are not confused, but we can\u2019t get a clear understanding frankly.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Sure.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We hear things about slowdown, I can only judge the results, we had a pretty good first quarter in our coil businesses in the U.S. So, it certainly has not manifested itself yet.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Okay. And you mentioned that packaging business is held up quite well. Is that because of its consumer orientations or is it anything going on in packaging?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think two dynamics. Number one, as I mentioned before, that business has performed consistently through ups and downs of economic cycles. Secondly, in our particular case, the strength of our technology particularly our water-based technology on a global basis, as our customers strive to meet sustainability challenges and strive to meet green challenges. Our water-based technology is finding a significant place and we are quite pleased that it is delivering the kind of value proposition to our customers that's manifested in our results.", "Prashant J. Juvekar - Smith Barney Citigroup", "Okay, thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli, I&S. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Good morning all.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Thank you for allowing me to make it. Based on some of the comments that you made, Bill, regarding the sales of more water-based versus solvent. If I understood, what you said probably it sounds those water-based businesses has the lower margin than the solvent, and therefore it is going to continue affecting coatings until we are on an apples-to-apples basis. Is that correct?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No. I was talking about our packaging business, which is one component of our coatings business. And what was driving growth in our packaging business and frankly we are quite pleased with the profitability of our water technology.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "I guess, I was going back to Jeff's question when he compared the coatings margin this year versus last year and you talked about people... customers' building, solvent, inventory, particularly in Europe so they can use it as long as it was in the inventories and that had an effect in the margin?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sorry, automotive refinish.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Automotive refinish, sorry, are you [inaudible] somewhere in there?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no, I am sorry.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "No, my mistake. We'll see some impact in the second quarter; it should wash through by the end of the second quarter though. So, second half of the year should be more apples-to-apples.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay, all right. And then packaging rule obviously at a high rate of 15%, can you pull out the effects from it?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "What the effects was\u2026", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "You have some 15%. I am sorry.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "5%.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "5% for the things.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "5%, right.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "And the 10%, is it mostly volume and you still... we still didn't see much of the price increases announced in January?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's a strong business; we are very pleased with how it performed in the first quarter.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "I guess, we are not going anywhere. We are not getting any more details than that. On the Aries acquisition. Did you acquire any manufacturing facilities and now you're moving some Valspar into those potentially newer plants or is it the other way around?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No. We acquired a quite a good facility. In fact I would classify it as excellent facility in Monterrey. And we are in the process now of integrating. We also had facilities reasonably close to the Aries facility. So we're now in the process of optimizing that, but we're... we certainly are very pleased with the manufacturing facility, it will allow us a lot of capacity to grow in the future. And also gave us some capabilities in Mexico that we did not have before, particularly resin or polymer manufacturing and also some really good laboratories.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "But did I understand probably you are shutting down the Valspar plant and moving that production into the Aries plant.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No. We are in the process of integrating the facilities right now. I did not say that we are going to shut down the Valspar facility.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. So you are only shuffling what you are making at both places. Is that?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "That's right Rosemarie. It's a traditional acquisition in the sense that there is a lot of synergies in terms of raw material savings, in terms of focusing the production of one type of product in one plant versus the other, so that you get efficiencies in manufacturing. And of course there should be some SG&A overlap as well. So, it's a very traditional type of transaction for us in a very good market.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. And then lastly, Aries had $40 million in revenues. What were their EBIT?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We didn't announce that.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "No, but I thought you might want to talk about it.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "It's similar to that other question.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Some places are really uncomfortable to go.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "All right. And when we talked about slight... you addressed the overseas market in terms of slowdown. I think you mostly talked about your European packaging business. Could you extend your observations as to what is going on overseas in other markets and other regions?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Asia remains quite robust. And we are certainly pleased with that, China continues and our South East Asia business continues well. Australia, that economy continues to do well. Our business continues to do well there. In South Africa, we have primarily a packaging business and that's doing well. The Brazilian economy continues strong. And our business results reflect that. I think that the comment that I made before was relative to any assessment we might have of coil coating, general industrial coating, architectural coatings in Europe. And what I meant to convey was... our biggest business is Can Coatings, packaging and for us I think it's too early for us to have any kind of a view on those other markets.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "In Europe.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Continue the good job.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead?", "John McNulty - CSFB", "Hi good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning John.", "John McNulty - CSFB", "Just a quick question, with regard to the recent big acquisitions in the space overall, are you benefiting from some of your competitors' acquisitions right now, as they are trying to kind of clean things up and customers are maybe looking for alternative suppliers, are you seeing incremental pressure. Can you just give us a feel for what the competitive environment may be looking like right now and how you are dealing with it?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Quite frankly, we've seen no impact, that I'm able to do so, either positive or negative. Maybe it's too early, but I'm\u2026 frankly I suspect that's what I all answer to that question a year from now.", "John McNulty - CSFB", "Okay. And thanks a lot.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, John.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We do have a follow up questions from the line of Don Carson, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, it's Adam Mickiewicz from Moretime [ph]. Just wanted to understand, maybe a question for Paul on the outlook for the debt at the end of the year. Obviously, rising it from what was previously. Can you just explain your desired debt-to-cap or debt-to-EBITDA and net-debt-to-EBITDA target that as you see it, just if EBITDA is rising year-over-year, what would be the impetus to step down the debt levels, in favor of share repurchases or something else? Thank you.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, that's a good question. I've something, that I think are... will continue to look at over the rest of this year and next year. But, basically we've got a sort of 40% to 50% debt-to-cap objective. And we're in that right now. I think it's fair to say that we need to continue to grow our funds from operations and once that's at the appropriate levels then we'll have more degrees of freedom in terms of what we might do in terms of either paying down debt or leaving a word is or even potentially increasing it. But, we we're right where we want to be in terms of debt-to-cap ratio right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right. It would seem like the cash was previously in your last five years plus was for acquisitions and the debt level rose with the rise in EBITDA and the capitalization. So, just with the idea that may be your emergence in Valspar's shares than someone else's sales, it would look like that that should not be decreasing... how much the guidance for flat shares in second quarters based on no share repurchases.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. I think, what the best way to look at it is, we've got free cash flow that's pretty significant. And we can either spend it on acquisitions or on our stock. I think Bill commented on what his preference would be at these levels. But having said that, we don't know if there is something that comes up, acquisition wise down the road. My guesses is that, with we spend a just on those two items and didn't pay down debt, we would be we'd be able to stay in the range that we want to be in, in terms of debt-to-capital and in terms of our investment grade rating.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Next question is to follow from the line of Jeff Zekauskas, JP Morgan, Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "Thank Tim. A few questions. What parts of your wood business are doing well and which parts are not doing so well, and is there anything you can do to effect the rate of change in wood or have all the steps that you can take been taken and so you're waiting for various upturns in the economy?", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J P Morgan", "It's an interesting question, Jeff. I would tell you first the first part, which is what's doing well, what\u2019s relatively well, I think this is a relative answer. Certainly, our wood business in Huarun continues to perform well. Our business in Southern China, Vietnam, other parts of South East Asia, which has been primarily for export back to the U.S, and on a historical basis has been high end furniture coatings, but over the last probably 24 months, we have made some inroads in what I will call a middle market strategy, coatings for lower price furniture. It\u2019s the impact of what's going on in the U.S, but we seem to be able to perform reasonably well. Our problem are inside the U.S and frankly, I think we are at a point now where this is just a question of we have taken all the right steps to right size the cost structure and I think there is no more steps that I can see that are clear to me that we should take. There are some small... some parts of the wood business that are doing better than others. Our wood business in the U.S. is building products. We've talked in the past, James Hardie is a major customer, their business seems to be holding up on a comparative basis well. Other parts of building products are as you might expect tied primarily to new construction and have really been hurt badly. And one of the things that has occurred, the kitchen cabinet business for us held up reasonably well in 2007... in the first half of 2007 and that now has gotten soft. So, I think we have got the right cost structure in place that when this turns and it will turn\u2026 now, which year is a discussion we can have, I meant that a little bit tongue and cheek, it will turn. We have tremendous upside leverage relative to our cost structure. So, I don't see any more obvious things to do, Jeff.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, that was helpful. Did you say Bill at a point that you expected your interest expense for the year to be down 5% to 10% if you didn't buy back any stock or did I miss here that?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I said assuming that we bought back the 3,250,000 shares, assuming that took place, we would expect our interest expense to be 5% to 10% below that of 2007.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, good. I appreciate that. Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome Jeff.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question in queue is a follow-up also from Saul Ludwig, KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "If we look at the manufacturing costs, in other words all costs excluding raw materials. What happened to that pattern of cost and what do you think might happen in the balance of the year?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "So, I think we are doing a reasonably good job there if you are talking about all other costs, I presume you're talking about SG&A and...", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "No, no, everything that would go into cost of goods other than the cost of raw materials.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, on a relative basis quarter-to-quarter I think we did a pretty good job in the first quarter.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And would you track that is that something you track and have a definitive answer too?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes in terms of quantitative answer.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Yes.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's basically flat, year-over-year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay and do you think you can keep that flat even with... you know you had a little more volume?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes I think that's a reasonable proposition I think we should be able to manage that, that's one of the focus areas we should be able to manage that well through the balance of the year.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then on the operating expenses where in the first quarter you were up from about 148 to 155 you are up 7 million bucks or maybe that's around 5%. You think that pulse of increase is what we should look for, including the savings that you are going to get from the lower promotional expenditures?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Give me a second here, Saul. Yes probably something in that range makes sense.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay and then I just this morning Sherwin-Lambs just announced that they are acquiring a company over in Asia that is in the wood products that's targeted furniture, flooring, cabinets, company called Inchem.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes out of Singapore.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Is that one that you were looking at that would have been conjectural to what you are doing with program?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "No we were not looking at that's all.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay great thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "One moment for the next question. We have a question from David Saks [ph] Hockey Capital. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Two questions one simple, the earnings guidance range for this year, did that assume the buyback of the 3 million share I thought you said it may [inaudible] assume the interest expenses as if it was?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "We never include in buybacks at least exclusively and any guidance we give...", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay but the comment on the interest expense would be down 5% to 10% if the peers were bought back, so in theory it would be down more than that?", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "That's true. I think if you did include it in the guidance it would be de minimus.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Right in '08, but it'll help '09.", "Paul C. Reyelts - Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Second question, which is just to give you a chance to expand on this with some latitude, can you talk a little bit about your multi-year strategy, your targets for operating margins for the different segments of the company?  We\u2019ve experienced unusual demand situation over the last couple of years for coating and the painting side. And also raw material pressures that have held back margins, so just curiously where do you think a normalized or sustainable operating margins can be once raw material headwind cost have been recovered and we get back to it what might being considered and normal housing environment.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think on a multi-year sort of a look out, all three to five years to five years, several things. One, as we grow outside the U.S. we are going to leveraging up our international cost structure. In some areas of the world where we have built infrastructure we still have a lot of room to grow into that infrastructure we should be able to leverage. And that's an overall international comment. With respect to our architectural business, which is one that certainly absorbed the pressure as you point out of raw material increases over the last few years. But also --.", "Unidentified Analyst", "As the brand on there as well.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Also felt the pressure of the branding initiative, of the branding investment. It's our belief, as we come out of the housing recession for lack of a better word and overall multiyear period as a result of growing a richer mix because, we're growing at the premium price points. We're transitioning most if not all of our business over the premium price points. As a result of that top line growth, we will be able to leverage both the brand spend, which will decrease over time and also lever the other SG&A, which will not increase as quickly as sales. Bottom line is I believe that we should be able to increase our operating margins in the Paints segment by 500 basis points over a five-year period.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That would be 14% of so percent and then you look at companies like Bare Paints [ph], which is delivering operating margins in the mid 20s selling to essentially one customer.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Is the difference there just that they have got concentrated volume with consistent production flows or how does that. How do you justify them making 24%, 25% operating margins compared to your business doing dramatically different now?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Frankly I don't justify it. Tongue and cheek I think it's a question for the customer and the supplier on that side of the equation to answer. We think we can move towards there, I don't pretend to understand it completely, total nature of the other relationship. It is a benchmark that we think we can move our business towards.", "Unidentified Analyst", "But if you got to a 14% margin in paints that would be obviously considerable grant from here, and what about on the coatings business, does that get back to 11.5, 12 where we've --", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. It should and 12 and 12, 13...", "Unidentified Analyst", "And is that you're going to buy what you're talking early about your proprietary technologies or new products or is that just leveraging the capacity or footprint as you grow or expand globally?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "It is a function of recovering the wood business, it is a function as we bring our technology in other businesses other than our packaging business to bear in the international markets and also as we continue to lever upon expense.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And is there anything that you've seen over the course of the last year or two that would make you question that company's historical approach to kind of top line planning or the business normally grew sort of 5% to 6% organically or 5% to 7% organically and then had acquisitions... the tuck-in acquisitions sort of doubling that growth rate. Is that 5% or 7% organic growth still seem reasonable to you over a three year to five year look or is that aggressive just given what did you see happening in the U.S. economy or elsewhere.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think that is the difference between short-term and long-term. I think...lets presume... lets make couple of assumptions. Number one, let's assume the U.S. goes into recession and so we have 60% of our business in the U.S., 40% outside I think you could argue that 5% organic is pretty very tough roll at there. But looking at on a longer-term perspective, I think that is a sustainable growth number...organic growth number in that 5% range.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Because if we do or don't go into recession, the U.S. paint categories going from, I think over the last 40 years there was only one year where that paint sales in unit volumes was down 1% for you in '06. And now in '06 it was done 1, '07, it was down '08... '08 it could be down mid single-digits for the industry, so kind of unprecedented declines, it would seem like you've already won the brunt of that at least in the coatings business... or the paint, excuse me, business?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "We've borne a good piece it, you're right.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, David.", "Operator: Our next question is from the line of Mark Havey of Spectra Advisory Research [ph]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This has been heck of a good call. Congratulations to both management and the people who have asked questions. I guess, I have somewhat the mirror image of the other call of the last question, which is, how vulnerable obviously your expertise at cost cutting is very helpful, but let's assume none of us knows sure what's in store for us that the coatings business worldwide goes... is hit by a fairly long economic... period of economic decline, let's say in the 2% or 3% range for several years at what point... have you looked at that kind of hopefully worst case scenario and seeing the impact and the steps that you would be able to take in response to such a economic decline? In other words something similar to what the world experience may be in the mid 70s?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the first reaction I would have is that you're going to see raw material cost ease up and that's half of our cost structure. So, in previous deep recessions where we have had our normal sort of supply demand balance, we've actually seen margin expansion help offset top line decline. That happened in the early 80s, I think it may have happened in the early 90s as well. So, that'll be the first reaction and second thing is as you shrink your top line, you're going to take money out of working capital and reduce your debt, so forth. The coatings business is not capital intensive and it is pretty resilient. You're describing a scenario that I think hopefully as the worst case scenario, but one that I think we would survive and I say we, not only we as a company but probably other companies in our industry that are well-managed, we probably survive better than many other companies in other industries.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. That's an interesting perspective. Thanks a lot.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Okay. Speakers at this time, we have no further questions in queue.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well thank you everyone for your participation and for questions today, just quickly summarizing we had a good quarter, we are pleased. Our international business is quite strong, our U.S. business performed well. We are in a process of implementing price increases and our businesses are focused on generating new business and operational excellence. And we look forward to being with you all again in our second quarter conference call in May. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference.

A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning.", "After the review of first quarter results, we will open this session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.  Thank you, you may now begin.", "Bob Wells", "In order to allow more time for questions, we have provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at Sherwin.com under investor relations, first quarter press release.", "Summarizing the company\u2019s overall performance for first quarter 2008 versus first quarter 2007, consolidated net sales grew 1.5% to $1.78 billion due to strong sales by our Global Group and acquisitions that were partially offset by sales declines in The Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group.  ", "Consolidated gross profit dollars decrease $10.9 million for the quarter to $780.5 million.  Gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 43.8% of sales from 45.1% of sales in the first quarter last year.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 36.6% of sales in the first quarter this year from 35.2% last year.  Interest expense net of interest and investment income increased $5.7 million compared to the first quarter last year.  ", "Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $50.5 million or 30.9% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.  This year our tax rate in the first quarter was 31% compared to 31.6% in the first quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008 we expect our effective tax rate to be comparable to last year\u2019s rate of 32.6%.  ", "Consolidated net income decreased by $33.9 million to $77.9 million from $111.8 million in the first quarter of 2007. Net income as a percent of sales was 4.4%, down from 6.4% in the first quarter of last year.  Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased $0.19 or 22.9% to $0.64 per share.", "Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter of 2008 were down 1.9% at $1.03 billion.  Comparable store sales -- sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months  -- declined 6.5%.  The decrease in sales for this segment was the result of weak demand for architectural paint and non-paint items in most end user segments, partially offset by improved industrial maintenance coating sales and two acquisitions completed during 2007.  The acquisitions increased group net sales for the quarter by 3.2%.  ", "Regionally in the first quarter of 2008 our Eastern division led the sales performance followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division and Southeastern division.  Two of the four divisions achieved positive sales results in the quarter.", "Segment profit for the group decreased 31.9% to $83.3 million in the first quarter of 2008.  Acquisitions reduced segment profit by 5.6% in the quarter.  Segment margin decreased to 8.1% from 11.6% in the first quarter last year, due primarily to higher product and freight costs and the negative impact of acquisitions.", "In the Consumer Group for the first quarter of 2008 sales decreased 4.8% to $286.9 million.  The decline was due primarily to soft DIY demand at most of the segment\u2019s retail customers.  Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased to 23.7% in the quarter to $42.8 million.  Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 14.9% from 18.6% in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing and severity of raw material cost increases and lower volume throughput in our manufacturing and distribution operations.", "Turning to our Global Group for the first quarter of \u201908, sales in US dollars increased 14.8% to $461.9 million, due primarily to increased volume, selling price increases, favorable currency translation and acquisitions.  Sales in local currencies increased 7.9% in the quarter. Acquisitions increased the group\u2019s net sales by 3.7%.  This sales increase reflects growth across all geographies outside the US, and all product lines.", "Segment profit for the Global Group increased 21.7% to $43.1 million for the quarter.  Profits stated in local currency improved 11.9%. This improvement was mostly attributable to increased sales, operating efficiencies related to increased volume and expense control.  Acquisitions were slightly accretive to Global Group profit in the quarter.", "I would now like to comment briefly on some of our balance sheet items.  Our total debt on March 31, 2008 was $1.35 billion, including total short-term borrowings of $1.04 billion.  Total debt on March 31, 2007 was $1.03 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $20.1 million compared to $299.8 million at the end of first quarter 2007.  ", "Total borrowings to capitalization were 45.4% at the end of the quarter versus 35.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2007.  Long-term debt to capitalization was 16% at the end of the first quarter this year compared to 13.8% last year.  ", "In the first quarter of 2008 the company purchased 4.1 million shares of its common stock in the open market.  At March 31, 2008 the company had remaining authorization to purchase 22.9 million shares of its common stock and we expect to continue from time to time our opportunistic purchases of the company\u2019s stock for treasury since we continue to believe our stock is a good value.  ", "In first quarter 2008 we spent $39.8 million on capital expenditures.  Depreciation expense was $35.8 million and amortization expense was $5.3 million.  For full year 2008, capital expenditures will be less than $160 million. A significant share of the capital expenditures will go toward investing in new stores with continued spending to upgrade our manufacturing facilities and replace other equipment where necessary.  ", "Depreciation will be about $150 million versus $139 million in 2007 and amortization will be about $21.4 million versus $24.5 million in 2007.  ", "I will conclude my remarks with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation.  In our appeal of the Rhode Island lawsuit to the State Supreme Court, briefing has been completed and oral argument is scheduled for May 15. These proceedings will be webcast. ", "In the ongoing abatement proceedings in Rhode Island, the appointed co-examiners have begun interviewing individuals they believe may help them understand what is necessary to abate the nuisance found by the jury to exist in the state. So far the interviews have been primarily of Rhode Island public health officials. It is expected that the entire process will take a number of months to complete. It is not tied to any deadline or timetable relating to the appeal.", "In Ohio, the lone remaining municipal lawsuit is the suit brought by the City of Columbus. The Ohio Attorney General\u2019s suit had been consolidated with the Columbus suit but was subsequently removed to federal court by the defendant. A federal judge will determine whether this lawsuit will be heard in federal court.", "In Wisconsin, the Thomas case, a personal injury case tried successfully to a jury last fall, has been appealed by the plaintiffs. Another individual plaintiff case has been accepted on appeal by the Supreme Court on the question of whether lead pigment is an inherently defective product. Approximately 36 suits were filed on behalf of individual plaintiffs in Wisconsin. Half of these have already been voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs.", "In California, the Intermediate Appellate Court recently overruled the Santa Clara Superior Court and held that the cities and counties could retain contingent fee counsel to aid them in their suit against lead pigment companies The companies will now decide whether to ask the California Supreme Court to consider the question.  ", "Finally in Mississippi, the Gaines case is currently scheduled to begin trial on June 17.  The case involves a single plaintiff adolescent. There are currently a number of procedural and dispositive motions pending before the court.  ", "That concludes my review of our results for the first quarter of 2008.  I will turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year.  ", "Chris Connor ", "Thanks, Bob and good morning, everyone.  Thanks for joining us today.  I know many of you were on our conference call on March 24 when we lowered our guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2008. That was a disappointing day for us.  It was the first time in 19 consecutive quarters that we failed to meet or exceed our original earnings guidance.  ", "Although there were many factors that contributed to our weaker than expected earnings in the first quarter, clearly in the declining demand for architectural coatings across most of North American market segments and the increase in the price of some petroleum-based raw materials over the past four months were the principal causes.  ", "Facing these market conditions, we began putting plans in place in the first quarter to improve our results over the balance of the year.  I\u2019ll highlight some of the things we are doing in a moment, but first let me touch briefly on a few things that we are not doing.  ", "For example, we are not counting on a near-term recovery in the housing markets. The prolonged weakness in sales of new and existing homes in the US has been a drag on industry-wide architectural paint volumes since the middle of 2006.  This downward spiral in these residential markets continued in the first quarter and we believe these markets will not show year-over-year improvement during the remainder of 2008.", "I think it\u2019s worth noting that the weakness in domestic sales in the first quarter was partially offset by stronger than expected sales growth from our Global segment.  Our businesses throughout most of Latin America and Asia continue to generate double-digit sales increases and in most cases, corresponding profit improvement.", "We are also not expecting help from the commercial construction market.  Forecasts for US commercial construction have recently turned negative.  In the first quarter, we saw a softening in the commercial construction activity which we expect will continue over the balance of the year. It\u2019s too early in the season to get a good feel for the strength of the residential and commercial repaint markets, but we have based our outlook for the remainder of the year on the assumption that growth in these markets will be challenging.", "Another thing we are not doing is counting on oil prices to drop back to the mid-2007 levels. The escalation in crude oil and natural gas and the declining U.S. dollar drove the cost of certain chemical commodities such as ethylene, propylene and methanol to all-time highs in the first quarter. Plant outages, plant and maintenance turnarounds and strong international demand, particularly in Asia, have also resulted in some supply tightness for a number of these commodities despite the weakness in the U.S. economy.", "If crude oil remains in the $110 to $120 per barrel range and natural gas remains in the $10 to $11 per million BTU range, it is likely the price of many raw material commodities will continue to rise. Given this scenario, we would expect the raw material price increases in the paint and coatings industry to increase at the high end of the range of 4% to 8% for the 2007 to 2008 timeframe.", "Let me take a few moments to highlight some of the things that we are doing. Internally, we refer to these efforts as trimming fat and building muscle. Throughout the first quarter, we began implementing aggressive plans to streamline the company and reduce SG&A. We have made adjustments to our part-time labor schedules and curtailed overtime hours in our stores. We froze hiring of non-essential positions across the company and consolidated functions wherever possible.", "We are also accelerating our closing of redundant store locations resulting from The Paint Stores Group acquisitions. During the first quarter, The Paint Stores Group opened 17 new stores and closed 23 redundant locations for a net reduction of six stores. During 2008, we expect our Paint Stores Group to open approximately 100 new locations and at the same time, continue their accelerated pace of redundant store closings, finishing the year with a net store increase.", "Our Global Group, on the other hand, opened nine new branches in the first quarter and closed none.", "We have already seen the effect of these efforts in some areas, however most of the impact will benefit our results in the second half. SG&A increased in dollars and as a percent of sales in the first quarter. Virtually all of these increases were attributable to currency exchange, acquisitions and new stores opened or acquired since the first quarter of last year.", "We are also building muscle, which means to us that we are taking actions that will strengthen our business in the short run and accelerate our growth in the long run. We have announced additional price increases across several of our businesses effective in the April/May timeframe. These second price increases in the year are necessary to help offset some of the raw material cost increases we are experiencing this year.", "This year, additionally, we will introduce a broad range of new and unique products and technology to the market. For example, our new moisture-resistant, resilient exterior latex cures in about half the time of conventional exterior paint, allowing customers to paint outdoors even when there is rain or dew in the forecast.", "Perhaps most important, we remain committed to providing the high quality service our customers have grown to expect. Raising prices and reducing expenses are not without some risk. We will manage these risks in part by ensuring that our customers continue to receive Sherwin-Williams trademark quality service across the company\u2019s footprint.", "Over the balance of the year we anticipate continued softness in most domestic end user markets and we expect that will continue to restrain our sales growth. Our outlook for the second quarter of 2008 is for sales to be up in the low single-digits over last year\u2019s second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.60 per share, compared to $1.52 per share for the second quarter of last year.", "For the full year 2008 we expect sales to increase in the low single-digits over 2007. With annual sales at that level we are reaffirming our guidance that our diluted net income per common share for the year will be $4.70 to $4.85 per share compared to $4.70 per share last year.", "Finally, last week, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, continuing toward our longstanding record of paying out 30% of prior-year\u2019s earnings per share. ", "Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and now we would be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", " ", "Your first question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Good morning. Was there much difference in your ability to raise price in coatings versus your ability to raise price in Paint Stores in the first quarter?", "Chris Connor", "Jeff, our ability to do that has been historically pretty much consistent with what we saw in first quarter.  As we\u2019ve commented in the past, we have a little more pricing leverage and ability through our stores model than we do through our consumer segment and that would have been true in the first quarter of 2008.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "So order of magnitude, were prices up 2% in stores and zero in coatings? Is that the right order or is there a different order of magnitude?", "Chris Connor", "I think we\u2019ve commented about the company\u2019s performance as opposed to segment on pricing. We indicated that throughout the first quarter we were taking pricing in the range of 3.5 to 6.5 for the company. That was consistent across all segments. Sean, do you want to comment about what percentage of that pricing we actually received in the first quarter?", "Sean Hennessy ", "In total we were in the 50% to 60% range, so that 3% to 5% Chris talks about, 50% to 60% of that we realized in the first quarter.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "So 50% to 60% of 3% to 5% so that\u2019s a little bit more than 2%? Is that what you realized? ", "Sean Hennessy ", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Were you satisfied with your SG&A cost control in the first quarter?", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "Yes. When you take a look at the annualization of the acquisitions and when you take a look at where we came in at versus what we had forecasted, we were very close to what we had forecasted.", "Chris Connor", "Now having said that, Jeff, we are taking aggressive steps to reduce the going forward, so room for improvement to be sure.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "Are your volume expectations for the second quarter very different from the volume trends that you experienced in the first quarter?", "Chris Connor", "No.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", " ", "It is similar same-store volumes is what you are expecting?", "Chris Connor", "Right. We are giving guidance that we will be in the low single-digit sales growth. We are not seeing significant mix changes, so the volume is going to be consistent with what we had in the first quarter.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup.", "", "Anthony Petaneri  \u2013 Citigroup", "This is Anthony filling in for PJ. On their earnings call last week, PPG indicated that their sales to the big boxes were holding up relatively better than their paint stores. When you look at DIY customers going through big boxes and then professional contractors going through paint stores, do you have a sense of which segment will start to stabilize first?", "In terms of volume and demand, where do you see the light at the end of the tunnel?", "Chris Connor", "I don\u2019t think we are in a position to comment on which ones of those we think will stabilize or rebound first; this softness is pretty consistent across both of those segments, so time will tell. ", "Anthony Petaneri  \u2013 Citigroup", "Obviously the Global Group had a great quarter and I think on the year end call you indicated you expected segment sales to be up mid to high single-digits for the year. Given the strong performance this quarter, is low double-digits more realistic?", "Chris Connor", "Our first quarter is always the smallest quarter we have in the course of the year, so I think we are still comfortable with the guidance we have given for Global. If we start to make some progress in these next quarters we will adjust that.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "We have now had three quarters in a row where we have heard about dilution from acquisitions. When does that turn?", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "I think when you take a look at it, Saul, we are happy with the acquisitions we have made.  I would tell you that if you compare it to the cycle, the integration is going well. I would tell you that we had the fourth quarter and the first quarter and as we mentioned, we believe that the second quarter we are going to see improvement and the third quarter will be close to flat and then the third quarter we will start seeing some improvement versus last year. I think that is when you are going to see it.", "Just when you take a look at the market in general, as the market has gone down that has caused our sales to be a little behind on these acquisitions.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "When we look at the detriment in your margins in both consumer and The Paint Stores, how much of that detriment was due to a contraction in your variable margin \u2013 your price versus your raw materials -- versus volume as it impacted fixed cost absorption?", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "I would tell you that the fixed piece was probably 20% to 25%.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "And the other the largest share, okay. In the interest expense, I was very surprised to see your interest expense lower in your first quarter this year. We had expected a substantial increase in interest expense year over year. Your average debt appeared to be much, much higher this year than last year. What was the story with interest expense and what do you see for the rest of the year, Sean?", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "When we talk about interest expense, we also, if you take a look at it, Saul, the interest income was down. When you take a look at it \u2013", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "I am talking about the debt which is gross interest.", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "Right. What we expect is our debt is going to be higher; our interest income will be lower I think than we have been talking about when you combine the two we would be up somewhere between $8 million and $10 million this year versus last year. That is what we expect. We expect that by the end of the year our total debt will be in that $950 million range.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "I understand why your interest income is down; I don\u2019t understand why your interest expense, just gross interest expense that you write for the amount of debt and the rate that you pay was down in the first quarter when your debt had to be up $250 million.", "Sean Hennessy ", "I think when you take a look at the interest rates we went out there with some of the liquidity instruments that we have that are at favorable LIBOR rates.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "So it was rates that did it? ", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "Yes. ", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "How much did you spend for the stock that you bought?", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "$220 million at an average cost of $53.69. ", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "Finally, I know you skirted the question, the 6.5% drop in comp store sales, should we assume Chris that that may have been 8.5%, 9% in volume with a 2%, 2.5% increase?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. I didn\u2019t intend to skirt that question at all. Absolutely, our volume in stores across the company is climbing faster than sales as it would with pricing volume.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "Right, but are the numbers that I \u2013", "Chris Connor", "Yes, you are in the range.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Amy [Vane] \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Amy Vane \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I am curious about the industrial coating. As the U.S. manufacturing economy continues to soften, and as several of your competitors obviously have noted some weakness there. Can you give us some color?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, the industrial coatings business for us is in our Global segment which had a good quarter. Within that segment, the industrial coatings piece of it also contributed to the improvement for the quarter.", "The vast majority of that business is domestic business. We have some exposure to Asia Pacific and some of those softening markets that our competitors might have talked about, but we are seeing some modest strength and growth in that business, Amy, both domestically and building from a very low share position outside of the United States.", "Amy Vane \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Two or three of your competitors when they reported their results, obviously there were some surprising volume gains through the big box retailers, the DIY customer. Over the past one or two quarters, have you seen any market share shift in the DIY channel?", "Chris Connor", "Amy, we really don\u2019t have the data to determine that. The only information we have seen on that is exactly what you have seen. We know how our business through our consumer segment is, it is obviously soft. But in terms of shift between manufacturers, we don\u2019t know.", "Amy Vane \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Lastly, the SG&A percentage of total sales nearly [inaudible] this year. On an annual basis, what is your expectation for \u201908? I know you have some pretty aggressive internal initiatives going on.", "The historical range for the annual rate is about 32% to 34%. Do you expect to achieve the high end of that range, or a mid-point? Can you give us some color for that line?", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "Basically we have given you the annual guidance on sales and EPS. Right now we really are not going to go down the P&L and give you guidance of what we think the SG&A or give you a range for gross margin and so forth.", "Amy Vane \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So going forward, do you expect SG&A as a percent of your total sales, this ratio to keep climbing on a sequential basis? Is it still high on the year over year basis?", "Sean Hennessy ", "We believe our SG&A will be higher as a percent this year than last year, yes.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Research", "If we look at the acquisition environment, how does that appear to you in terms of perhaps sellers that might be a little more interested in talking to you right now versus a year ago?", "Chris Connor", "There are a number of opportunities in the market right now, Chuck, that we are speaking with as are others. I think given the softness in the U.S. market particularly, some sellers may be more inclined to hang on and wait for better forecasting going out. We expect that there will be a couple deals we will be able to get done this year.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Research", "If you look at your Paint Stores segment and one makes an assumption about what percent of those sales go to new construction, what kind of shift have you seen in the sales mix there over the last few months? ", "That is, if one assumes it is \u201cx\u201d percent, how much of that percentage has gone down?", "Sean Hennessy ", "We don\u2019t give specific percentages of the specific customer bases inside of that. I think in Bob\u2019s comments, the discussion about regions of the country and how they were doing. We indicated that our Eastern and Midwestern divisions, which are the Northern markets for us, actually had sales gains and it was in the Southwest and Southeast particularly where we were struggling. Those would be the areas of the country where historically we have had the most aggressive new home construction market. So there is significant mix change in those two divisions as they are taking the brunt of the new residential market slowdown, which by the way, continues. Estimates that perhaps we were nearing the bottom of that I think have now been amended and we expect the new housing market to continue to spiral downward this year, as we commented.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "On price, can you talk \u2013 Sean, I know you had commented that you had seen 50% of the price increases stick to this point. Can you just talk about how this is going and why the need to push forward with a second price increase and perhaps a bit of guidance on the magnitude of that second price increase?", "Chris Connor", " ", "Sure, I would be happy to, Eric. I think the pricing is going exactly as it has for us historically through this model. We were asked the question earlier in the call by Jeff Zekauskas regarding stores versus our other businesses. This is following the historical pattern that we have seen.", "As Sean has commented, we are giving a portion of that pricing as the season unwinds and we are able to conclude those negotiations, get off some jobs that perhaps we had provided some pricing protection for. It is on track to continue to be implemented, as we commented.", "Frankly, as we said on the earnings call, we did not see the rapid and steepness of this raw material climb appropriately in the fourth quarter and did not get the kind of price increases we need to cover us for the calendar year.", "For those reasons, the management team has decided that it is necessary to get a second price increase in the year.  As you recall, we\u2019ve done this as recently as the \u201904-\u201905 time period where we went out for two price increases in the course of the year and unfortunately we are in that position where we have to do it again in calendar year 2008.", "Our Stores Group has announced in the month of April that they would be taking pricing up again effective May 5, 4% and those price increase announcements are out there as we speak and we are working through them.

We would like to continue with the question-and-answer session. Eric, we were in the middle of a question from you about pricing, so if we could continue that line of questioning, that would be great.", "Chris Connor", "I am not sure how much of my answer got through, Eric. Did you get that, or do I need to repeat it?", "Operator", " ", "Eric is out of the queue.

I mean you purchased about 170 stores last year and I was wondering if you could give me an idea of how many you plan to close and elaborate on the situation. Have some store locations been weaker than expected in the current environment? What is the thought process as it is flowing into this movement?", "Chris Connor", "Very good question, Steve. I think as we comment on redundant store locations it really speaks to the acquisitions that we have made for quite some time now, not just last year. As we have discussed, we have historically taken a very slow path to integrating stores from these acquisitions; maintaining stores sometimes literally next to each other, across the street, well within a mile location.", "A number of these store locations that we are speaking of are [Duran] store locations that we purchased back in 2004 and there are other store locations from acquisitions made even prior to that. In the State of Florida, for example, Flex Bond and others. So it is a combination of the groups that we had made last year plus historically. So there is quite a large number of stores to look at.", "Including in that, when we say redundant acquisitions oftentimes allow us an opportunity to close an existing Sherwin-Williams store and consolidate into the acquisitions\u2019 location which may be a better facility. We are just taking the softness in the market to accelerate what would be a normal trend for us, to start to close these things at a later point in time.", "In terms of total count, it is a little difficult for us to get our arms around that for the moment. Our guess is it is going to be somewhere in the 40 to 60 to maybe even 70 range as the year unwinds, hence the comment that 100 stores will generate somewhere in the net 20, 30, 40 new stores for us as the year unwinds. Hopefully that gives you a little more color there.", "Stephen O\u2019Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "That\u2019s helpful. Lastly on interest expense, how much of the lower interest do you think was caused by moving to short-term debt? As a follow on to that, do you plan to maintain this high level or are you going to try to lock in some rates as the year goes on? If you do, what might that do to your interest expense through the year?", "Sean Hennessy ", "Actually, 100% of the interest rate reduction was because we have not \u2013 we have stayed in the short interest rate environment. I would say we are continually watching. We have looked at the ten-year rate. Essentially as we have consistently said, we are waiting to see a little more clarity on the lead situation and once we do then we believe we can get a document to go back into the long-term market without a lot of covenants and then what we will do is we plan eventually to term some of this out and lock in the long-term rates at rates that we believe will be a little higher than what we are paying short-term, but then we will also have the ability to look at some swaps.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc", "Just one quick follow-up. A lot of people have referred to the PPG release, and as you know in their public release they said that their unit raw material costs were up only 2% year over year and that they expect the full year raw material cost increase to be 2% to 4%. Those seem to be pretty modest numbers. I am trying to reconcile what they have said publicly with what you are experiencing, because if raw material costs were in fact up only 2% you wouldn\u2019t have had the margin compression that you experienced.", "Bob Wells", " ", "Saul, it is difficult for us to comment on PPG\u2019s raw material costs because we have no specific knowledge of their mix of materials. Further, as you know, we only comment on the industry basket of raw materials which we define pretty broadly. Because the mix varies pretty significantly company to company, we prefer to just keep our comments on our outlook for the industry, both in the quarter and over the balance of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Research", "Guys, I don\u2019t have a question. I was just hitting buttons when you were asking if anybody could hear us, so\u2026", "", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates.", "Alan for Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates", "Good afternoon. This is Alan on for Ivy. First a housekeeping question. On your full year EPS guidance, what tax rate and share counts are you using?", "Sean Hennessy ", "What we have said is we believe the tax rate will be very comparable to the 32.6% tax rate we had last year. We really have not given guidance on our share count.", "Alan for Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates", "Chris, I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more on your comments about the commercial construction market. I think you said that you saw some softening in 1Q and on your call a month ago you said you were expecting commercial to be up I believe low single digits for the year. ", "I was just wondering if softening in 1Q implied that it was actually negative on a year over year basis, or if it was just less positive? If so, do you still expect it to be up in that low single-digit range?", "Chris Connor", "I am happy to comment on that. We refer often to a number of industry data points. One of them is the McGraw Hill\u2019s Dodge Report which I think on the last call had indicated a slowing in commercial construction but still positive for \u201908. Those reports now are tending to show, particularly in the segments that we sell coatings into, negative projections for \u201908. ", "So it is not a first quarter only phenomena; we were expecting that commercial new construction activity will be negative for the year.", "Alan for Ivy Zelman \u2013 Zelman and Associates", "In terms of quantifying that in low single-digits, negative? ", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co. ", "", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "", "A couple of quick questions and I apologize in advance if they were already asked, I had to redial back into the call because the phone had technical difficulty. First, does the 3.5% to 6.5% pricing range you have spoken about include the second round of pricing?", "Chris Connor", "", "No, that was the first round we took out in the first quarter across all segments. One comment we made when you may have been offline was that our stores have announced in April effective May 5 an additional 4% price increase.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "So it would bring that range to \u2013", "Chris Connor", "7.5% to 10.5%. ", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "Then a couple of weeks ago you had talked about maybe being 1% or 1.5% off on pricing relative to recovering raw material costs during the first quarter. I know it has only been a couple of weeks since then, but any meaningful change in terms of the price cost gap, where you stand today?", "Chris Connor", "No, we are making progress towards it but in that short period of time no meaningful change.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "So you are still within that 60% realization on that 3.5% to 6.5%?", "Chris Connor", "I think Sean made the comment around closer to 50% through the first quarter.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "Of the 7.5% to 10.5%, how much would you expect to realize for the full year.", "Sean Hennessy ", "Typically when we take a look at the price increases over the history of the company we will eventually over a period of time \u2013 and we have actually commented sometimes it takes up to 18 months \u2013 but what we will end up with is 80% to 85%.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "But for 2008, of that amount probably are you thinking about half by the time it rolls in?", "Sean Hennessy ", "Probably slightly higher than half.", "Operator", " Your next question comes from Don Carson \u2013 Merrill Lynch.", "", "Analyst for Don Carson \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "", "Good morning, this is Adam in for Don Carson. A question about the price increases as it relates to product mix. Historically or in the first quarter at all have you seen any change in which price points are being purchased more by the contractors or by the DIY in your store?", "Sean Hennessy ", " ", "If you look at our company, when you take a look at the product mix we have actually had a slight improvement in our product mix. I would not call it very material, but the product mix is slightly higher.", "Chris Connor", "And that would be historic and consistent with past price increases we have seen, particularly in the contractor segment. When faced with higher prices, many of them step up to a better-performing product to help reduce labor costs.", "Analyst for Don Carson \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "But as you said, it is not terribly material, so it probably doesn\u2019t roll through to margins?", "Chris Connor", "That\u2019s correct. As opposed to marginally moving in the wrong direction, it is performing as it has historically and moving slightly up.", "Sean Hennessy ", "You have to realize the first quarter is typically our smallest quarter and so a lot of things that we see, even though they are positively moving it is not material for the full year.", "Analyst for Don Carson \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "A definitional question about your 4% to 8% outlook. You said it is a broader industry metric. Is there any component of freight in there with diesel costs and shipping costs?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, of course there is.", "Analyst for Don Carson \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Do you have an idea, 4% to 8% is the industry, is Sherwin-Williams at the upper end of that industry range as well?", "Chris Connor", "No, we would hope to be at the lower end of that industry range, given our size. We would expect to do better than our smaller competitors.", "Analyst for Don Carson \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "A final question on the Global Group, obviously you bought Nicco Paints last year and you have commented that would be a platform for growth in India. I was wondering if you had any further developments in any of the Asian regions, coupled with your purchase in Singapore?", "Chris Connor", "A lot of work happening in our Nicco business in India. I think it is a little premature to comment on the next steps but as Sean said, we are pleased with these acquisitions and they are continuing to move in the right direction.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Greg Goodnight \u2013 UBS.", "Greg Goodnight \u2013 UBS", "A lot of my questions have been asked and I appreciate your responses. The one question I still had was your comment about the Rhode Island appeal to the Supreme Court that oral arguments were going to be webcast. ", "A few questions. When will that be? Who is webcasting these oral arguments and why are they webcasting them?", "Bob Wells", "I believe that the Rhode Island court is actually controlling the webcast. It will be live so it will begin on May 15.", "Greg Goodnight \u2013 UBS", "And it will be on a website that the court provides?", "Bob Wells", "Correct.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from Jim Warner \u2013 Carlton Capital. ", "Jim Warner \u2013 Carlton Capital", "Thank you for taking my call. I have two questions. As we move into warmer weather, could you first provide any color on what you are seeing with regard to exterior paint demand?", "Second, what sort of exterior paint demand expectations have you built into your guidance for this year?", "Chris Connor", "Sure, as Sean has commented, the first quarter is our smallest quarter. We are heading into the historic painting season in the North American markets and we would expect to start to see the exterior paint market emerge.", "It is following the trends that we are commenting on where we expect low single-digit growth. There is not a significant mix change occurring here between interior and exterior coatings. The softness in the residential markets will have an impact there and it is consistent with the guidance we have given for the year.", "Operator", " ", "Your next question comes from  Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "A quick follow up. I was looking at your raw material cost expectations for the year, 4% to 8%, and if I translate that into absolute dollars it looks like it is roughly $300 million to $350 million, give or take a little bit.  At the midpoint of your 7.5% to 10.5% pricing that would imply $600 million to $650 million in pricing, creating a net benefit of somewhere around $300 million.", "And yet your guidance would suggest significantly less than that in terms of absolute gross margin dollars.  I am curious to know where the offsetting factors are. Is it SG&A, is it weak volume or lower volume? Just trying to get a sense of what diminishes that.", "Sean Hennessy ", "What I am doing in my head real quick, when you are using the 4% to 8% I guess you are using $3 billion in raw material purchases to get your $200 million to $300 million?", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "Roughly $300 million, yes.  Within the high end of your range.", "Sean Hennessy ", "Right. A couple of things here. You might have over-estimated. I don\u2019t believe our raw material purchases are that high. We have a lower number than that and maybe it is because a lot of times when we talk about paint, paint is not 100% of our sales so we have non-paint sales in there that you are probably adding 100% into the raw. So our numbers are a little higher.", "In the paint industry, raw is typically 50% of the average selling price, so in the 4% to 8%, that means that our total costs are going to go up about 2% to 3%.  Back to your point, the 4% to 7.5% to 10.5% that Chris mentioned is where you get into the 3% to 6.5% is the 12-month number. Then we have the 4% over eight months so you can\u2019t just add the 4% to the 3.5% to 6.5%. ", "So when you annualize that number, if we can get the 50% to 60% our gross margin dollars would be fairly close which means that our gross margin percent will be down slightly.", "Robert Felice \u2013 Gabelli & Co.", "So the answer is, you don\u2019t expect to get all 8.5%. The way it folds into the year, it will be a bit less than that.", "Sean Hennessy ", "Yes, because Stores Group has announced May, which means that we really only have eight months to get that in.", "Operator", " ", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Wells for closing comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks. We appreciate your joining us today and we apologize for the technical difficulties in the middle of the call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Walker, please go ahead.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings teleconference.", "Bill Mansfield, our Chairman and CEO is with me on our call this morning.", "A couple of brief comments before we begin: first, I would direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning, which contains much of the information that we'll be covering in the call. Also a reminder that in our comments this morning we will make statements that reflect our current views and estimates about future performance and financial results. These comments are based on certain assumptions and expectations that are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our Form-10-K filing lists some of the most important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from our predictions.", "This morning, I will cover our third quarter results. Bill will make a few comments, and then we'll get to your questions.", "Results for the quarter were in line with our expectations reflecting a solid effort from Valspar employees in a challenging economic environment. Third quarter sales totaled $957.7 million, up 7.2% from last year, driven by increase sales from acquisitions and currency.", "Adjusting for these two items, sales were up 0.6%. Demand for our products in international markets remained strong and our coating segment performed well. We continue to see weak demand for architectural and wood coatings products due to the softness in the U.S. housing market. Net income for the third quarter was $47 million. Third quarter adjusted net income per share was $0.50, which excludes a $0.03 per share charge related to restructuring actions, and $0.03 per share non-cash adjustment for Huarun minority interest.", "In 2007, third quarter net income was $58.2 million or adjusted net income per share up $0.57 excluding a non-cash adjustment of $0.05 per share for Huarun minority interest. For the underlying EPS comparison for the third quarter is $0.50 per share in 2008, and $0.57 in 2007. Our reported gross margin was 28.7%, or 29% when excluding restructuring, down 220 basis points from the third quarter of 2007.", "The decrease is due to higher raw material costs partially offset by pricing. Operating expenses were 19.7% of sales, or 19.6% excluding restructuring, essentially flat with the third quarter of 2007. The tax rate for the third quarter was 33.4% in 2008, versus 33.2% in Q3, 2007. We continue to expect the effective tax rate on income from operations for the full year to be 34% to 34.5%.", "With the adoption of FIN 48, we do expect to see some volatility in our effective tax rate from quarter-to-quarter. We do not purchase any shares during the quarter. Year-to-date, we purchased 1.85 million shares; average shares outstanding were down 2 million from a year ago. So the average shares outstanding were 99.8 million for the third quarter, and are projected to be about the same for the fourth quarter.", "Recapping our sales performance, we reported 7.2% growth in the quarter. Our core growth was up 0.6% for the quarter, a sequential improvement from a 2.6% decline in the second quarter. Our third quarter improvement in core growth was due primarily to pricing. Currency added another 3.9% and acquisitions added another 2.7% for the total sales growth of 7.2%.", "Looking at our segment results; coating sales increased 12.2% and were up low single digits when adjusted for currency and acquisitions. Sales performance in both our packaging and industrial product lines was good, but packaging, in particular, continuing show excellent strength. Paint sales increased 3.1%, and were up slightly when adjusted for currency and acquisitions.", "Our other category, which includes resins, colorants, gel coats, and our furniture repair business, was down about 5.7% and declined negative high single digit when adjusted for currency, reflecting the impact of the weak housing market in the U.S.", "The EBIT margin for our coating segment was 9.6% for the quarter or 9.8% excluding restructuring, down from 12.1% in the third quarter of 2007. Our paint segment EBIT margin was 8.8% or 9.5% excluding restructuring, down from 11.1% in 2007. The EBIT margin for our other category, which includes corporate expenses, was 3.7% or 4.5% excluding restructuring compared with 10.2% last year. Total company EBIT margin was 8.8% for the quarter or 9.2% excluding restructuring, down from 11.5% in 2007, and primarily reflects the differences, the lag between the raw material cost increases and the impact from pricing actions.", "Moving to the balance sheet; total debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.85 billion, up $68 million from the end of the last year. The increase is due to acquisitions and share repurchases of $40 million. We estimate that year end debt for fiscal year 2008 will be in the range of $950 to $975 million.", "Our total debt to capital ratio at the end of third quarter was 42.4% with net debt to capital at 40%. Capital spending on the third quarter was 8.6 %... sorry, $8.6 million, down from $15.5 million in the third quarter of 2007. And our forecast for capital spending for the full year is approximately $45 million.", "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $19.6 million, up from $17 million in the third quarter of 2007. Our full year forecast for depreciation and amortization remains at about $80 million.", "Let me give a few more details on our restructuring actions. The total costs of the overall effort are expected to be $0.21 to $0.23 per share with a two year payback. In addition to the $0.03 per share charge this quarter, the restructuring is expected to result additional charges to earnings of $0.10 to $0.12 per share in Q4 of this fiscal year. The fiscal 2009 impact for the full year will be neutral with savings offsetting in-year costs. Beginning in fiscal 2010, these actions are expected to generate annual savings of $0.12 to $0.14 per share.", "Finally, as you read in our press release, we reaffirmed our guidance for the year and continue to expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the $1.55 to $1.65 range, excluding any restructuring charges and non-cash adjustments for Huarun minority interest. Just as a remainder, our fourth quarter this year does include 14 weeks versus 13 weeks in 2007, which we expect to benefit results by $0.01 to $0.02 per share.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Lori, and good morning everyone. I'll make just a few brief comments before we take your questions.", "As Lori mentioned, results for the quarter were inline with our expectations. Our management team and Valspar employees did a good job of focusing on execution and delivering the operational discipline necessary in a very difficult environment.", "Let me start by and addressing raw material cost and pricing. As you know, we had been anticipating a 5% to 8% increase in raw material cost for the year. Year-to-date, we're at the high end of that range and now expect raw material cost increases for the full year to be in the range of 9% to 14%.", "We continue to raise prices across all regions and all of our businesses. As you would expect, we have seen a lag between raw material cost increases and the impact of our pricing actions. However, because of the progress made in this area, we are comfortable reaffirming our guidance. I would point that while crude oil prices have eased somewhat from their recent highs, which is good news, they are still 60% to 70% higher than last year, and raw material inflation is still moving through the supply chain.", "Just a brief comment about the restructuring actions we've initiated. Lori covered the expected financial effects and some detail. We constantly review our operations to identify opportunities to improve efficiencies. The restructuring announced reflects our efforts to further streamline our cost structure. We're currently in the process of notifying the effective parties and complying with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and will be in a position to provide additional details during our fourth quarter call.", "Moving to an overview of what we're seeing in our businesses; we are especially pleased with results from our international operations, which now account for around 40% of the total company. Our Huarun business in China performed well in the third quarter with sales up high double-digits and operating margins that remain above the corporate average. As you may recall, about 60% of the Huarun business is in our paint segment.", "In addition, we've been very pleased with the results of our brand building initiative in our paint segment. This is a key contributor to our results in a difficult market. In our coating segment, where there is a significant international component we were pleased with demand. Our industrial product lines performed well where new business, acquisition sales, and strong international performance resulted in high single digit sales growth.", "Packaging coatings continued to show strength across all regions, and I will remind you that this business over a long period of time has proven to be relatively immune to the ups and downs of economic cycles.", "Finally a word about cash; as I mentioned on our last call, in fiscal 2008, we will generate about $160 million in free cash flow, which we define as operating cash less capital and dividends. Year-to-date, we estimate we are $60 million to $65 million ahead of last year. On a full year basis, we expect that we will end up about approximately $100 million better than last year's performance.", "So with those comments, I will open up the call for your questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you, good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, David.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Bill, on the restructuring you have done... you have announced other programs in the past. Is this latest effort reflect your lower demand going forward or your additional ways to sort of the same demand with lower costs?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think it's the latter, David. We found additional ways to serve the current demand and expect to be increased demand over the next year, so just as a fundamentally lower cost.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "And on the U.S. business, has it hit bottom in your view on either the architectural side or the industrial side?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I will tell you what, that would be a pure speculation on my part. Certainly, we are pleased with the performance on a relative basis of our U.S. architectural business. Our wood coatings business still continues under great pressure. And our packaging business is fine and our general industrial, coil business performing well in the tough market primarily as a result of new business efforts. I would tell you that our... in our other segment, our resins business and our gel coat or composites business is certainly feeling some pressure from slowdown, but I think it would be... I don't think I'm one to call a bottom.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "And lastly if current oil prices hold, when would you crossover between price and raw materials, what quarter or next year?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "It's still unclear to me, how much raw material inflation is going to move through the supply chain when this is all done. I think 60% to 70% a higher cost this year versus last, is very, very difficult for us to forecast. As evidenced by not only us, but also the whole space in each quarter, we stop to this point reviving upwards our estimates of inflation. Having said that, it's clear, there's one answer, we've got to raise our prices and we continue to do that.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Rosemarie Morbelli with Ingalls & Snyder. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Good morning all.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Rosemarie.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "When you say that in '09 the impact of the additional restructuring costs are going to match... to be matched by savings, could you give us a feel for how much you are expecting in obviously the both cost and savings for '09?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, if you kind of look at the press release in terms right of my comments, I basically said the total cost will be between $0.21 and $0.23, so you can certainly do the math. We are saying this year it's between $0.13 and $0.15. So somewhere in that $0.06 to $0.10 will be the cost carried over to next year, and it would be offset with savings.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. So in other words, since we are eliminating the restructuring costs from the adjusted numbers, then you would have a charge of $0.06 per share or $0.10 whatever the magic number is at the time and then you will see benefit on the earnings side if we put it on an apples-to-apples basis. The same way, we are looking at it this year; we are eliminating the $0.03. So we should really be eliminating the cost next year. Shouldn't we?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That, that's correct.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. And then in the 2010 savings of $0.12 to $0.14, what are your expectations vis-\u00e0-vis the economy? Do you expect it to be flat with '09 going down further? What are you looking at to come up with $0.12 to $0.14?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I would tell you Rosemarie that to a certain extent, not entirely, but for the most part, the $0.12 to $0.14 is independent of a recovery and or a continuation of current conditions. If we get into a global... worldwide significant global slowdown, then I the think that's probably a different scenario. So, I would tell you for the most part, $0.12 to $0.14 is independent of economic assumptions.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "And if you were to... in '09 to see that well 2010, generally speaking, the economy is not going to get any better. Do you have additional steps that you can take or do you feel that by the end of '09 you will have done everything possible?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "As I said my remarks, we constantly continue to review our global businesses for efficiency opportunities. And we announced with us our steps that we need to take and make a lot of sense for our cost structure. I think I would be speculating if I would predict that there are any further steps. At this point in time, we feel we are done.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. Thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we move to Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. This is Amy now [ph] sitting for Bob. Bill, can you give us some update on the demand trend from the big box and also the contractor channel? And also has there been any pricing improvement in the big box channel?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first of all relative to demand, I think on an overall basis continues how it was in the second quarter? We have not necessarily seen any discernable uptick in overall demand from our market perspective. As I said in my comments, we are quite pleased with our branding investments and the way our branding has performed in this very difficult period of time. And I don't have any comments on price, Amy [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And then the second question is: there has been an increasing concern about a possible economic slowdown in China post the Olympics. If that's the case, what would be the impact on your Huarun business in that country? Can you just give us little bit more granularity on that business over the past several months and what's their expectations for the growth going forward?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, relative to the economic slowdown in China, our potential that I've seen lots of things written about. Our stance is a lot of that has to do with infrastructure... in infrastructure investments that have been made over the last several years that is not Huarun business. Our Huarun business is selling architectural coatings to Chinese consumers and it's also selling wood coatings to Chinese furniture manufactures to supply the domestic Chinese market. And I think that would be less effected by any slowdown in the over all Chinese economy.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Again can you just remind us of the gross target that our business both in the near term and the long-term?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "We expect that it will maintain 15% compound annual growth over the next five years.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome, Amy [ph].", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Hi good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "A few questions. What was cash flow from operations for the nine months?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Just estimating just from operations, it's probably in the $40 million to $50 million... this is operating cash flow, not free cash flow.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "All right.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Free cash flow on a year-to-date basis were about $60 million to $65 million; again that's an estimate better than last year.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Right. Better than... but $40 million to $45 million in cash flow for the nine months.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I'm sorry; I gave you that for the quarter.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay, I am sorry. So it's about $50 million, $80 million, I don't know, maybe $80 million for the nine months.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Ask your other questions, let me look a second.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay. Is the restructuring charge you plan to take cash or non-cash for the fourth quarter?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "It's combination of both, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "So what's the combination?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Fourth quarter, it's probably going to be more about 50-50 in terms of cash, non-cash.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Sort of, I don't know five in five; is that it?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's pretty close.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Pretty close, okay. And what kind of restructuring is it? What are you going to write down and what are you going to do to make your operations more effective and why doesn't it affect '09 or does it?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, this is Bill.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Yes.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "In my initial comments, we really are not in a position to give you anymore granularity, because we are still in the process as we speak of notifying people and going through required regulatory and legal notifications. And it would be reminisce with me to say anything. I realize that this would be somewhat difficult and... but in the fourth quarter we'll provide complete transparency on the issue for you.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "IfI recall last year, Bill, there was maybe $0.27 of brands building expenses. And I assume that there is less this year. Sort of order of magnitude, how much is there this year and so what's that delta?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The delta in the brand spending?", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Yes.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "We are... it was projected in a pretty much running along that line to be a $10 million reduction on year over... for a full year basis.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "$10 million reduction. And how much in your various restructuring programs have you saved net this year?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Deminimus.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, deminimus, Jeff. If you are talking about the one what we've just announced, we are always back in time. Yes, deminimus.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay. And that's because demand probably isn't as strong as you would have from that.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Exactly, right.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then Lori, perhaps you can give us an idea of the acquisition and the currency effects separated out by division, if you wouldn't mind.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Can I get back to you on that one, Jeff? I don't know that. And to answer your first question, our year-to-date operating cash flow estimate is somewhere around, call it, $105 million to $110 million.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "$105 million to $110 million for the first nine months.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay. I guess lastly the... you've talked about your raw materials... forgive me. For the fourth quarter and for the quarter you've just reported, are there any asset sales, land sales, equipment sales or any of those sorts of items affecting this quarter's earnings per share or and next quarter's earnings per share?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Not affecting this quarter's earnings per share. And we don't anticipate any in the fourth quarter either, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "In terms of the... you said that your raw materials you thought might step up. So, is it that the really step up in the next fiscal year, or do you expect your price increases to ripple through and offset the raw material inflation you are facing in that, you haven't changed their guidance?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Not entirely sure I understood your question. We continue to see and have rapid increase in our raw material costs, and I guess evidenced by the numbers that are in coated. And we are aggressively responding on the pricing front. Perhaps I didn't quite get the essence of your question.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "What I meant was you've maintained your earnings guidance for the fourth quarter.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Yet you've also said that your raw materials are stepping up significantly that is from 5 to 8 to may be 9 to 14.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "So all things being equal under those circumstances if you're not getting very good price pass through, presumably it would be hard to make your target. That's all I was trying.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think that presumes a point-to-point analysis. It's quite dynamic situation. And I could tell you that at the end of our second quarter conference call, the day after that call, it was quite clear that our raw materials, the pressure on raw materials was steeping up significantly. And so this is more of a dynamic process. And I think that our fourth quarter reflects as I said in the comments the momentum that that we're demonstrating in raising our prices.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Then I guess lastly, it's hard to make out the meaning of the SG&A and R&D changes year-over-year, but they seem relatively significant. That it looks like it's up about 8%. But you've got some acquisitions in there. Are you satisfied with your overhead performance, or is your overhead cost growth little bit more than you really want?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I'm quite satisfied with our SG&A performance. In fact, I would tell you it's good my in estimation. Part of the issue on a quarter-over-quarter basis is last year when we got to our third quarter; it became clear that from a compensation metrics point of view, we weren't going to hit our numbers. And so we took on a year-to-date adjustment in the third quarter of last year and the amount of incentive compensation that we were carrying on our books. This year we've been somewhat better at our planning, and we don't have that adjustment.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Sorry that you don't have that adjustment. In fourth quarter, is the tax rate likely to be 34% to 33%?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it will be somewhere in that 34% or 34.5%, Jeff, estimating it at this moment. Of course it can swing; it's paying upon some of the one-time items that come in with FIN 48.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you very much. Thank you for you...", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey Jeff, we're real quick just to get back to you on your FX and currency by segment. All the acquisitions... sorry, FX and acquisitions; all the acquisition is sitting in the coating segment. And then in terms of currency, the currency impact is roughly 5% in coatings and 2.7% in paints and about a 0.5% in others.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Thank you very much.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we go to Don Carson with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, thank you. Just a question on the paints: just what was the actual volume in your U.S. architectural paint? You've heard various people talk about the market being down in another perhaps 8% this year. Bill, what's your view as to the outlook for the U.S. architectural market?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, Don, firstly we continue to believe that year-over-year the U.S. architectural market will be down maybe 8% to 10% range. Secondly our volume in our architectural U.S. business was negative low single digits in the third quarter, Don.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And do you think that DIY is taking share from the contractors in the market downturn like this or do you think it's just that your better volume performance is just again your branding initiative?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Primarily I believe it's our branding investments, right?", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Significant traction.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "And do you have any plans to sort of leverage that branding investment to try and do more in the independent dealer channel or just your agreement bit low is really forbid that use of that brand in the independent channel?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No, that brand has been in the independent channel all along Valspar brand and Cabot, and continues to be... we continue to invest not only just in lows in the big box channel, but invest heavily in the independent channel also.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And what is the approximate split now? Are you still around 75%, big box 25% independent and where would you see that split going?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That's probably right. And the independent channel is a tough one. I think that what is on an overall basis from a marketplace perspective, I think the boxes in plural continue to take share from the independents. And that's a dynamics that's been going on for many years.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "All right. Okay, thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Don.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next we go Saul Ludwig with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good morning everybody.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Lori, what was the actual dollars of restructuring and cost of goods and operating expenses in the third quarter and what will the approximate amounts for those dollars be in the fourth quarter?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Let's see.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Saul, why don't you ask if you have another question while...?", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Sure. Varied within your paint sector is also your auto refinish business.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "With people driving last, getting into fewer accidents, how is your auto refinish business performing as it's part of the paint's reported sector?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I was pleased with the third quarter performance of automotive refinish. It performed reasonably well, Saul. Certainly with people driving less, that would have and impact in U.S. But as you well know on a comparative basis, our automotive refinish business is much, much smaller than some of the other folks, who... where that trend would be far more discernible than ours been [ph].", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "But it's $100 million and somewhat business for you, isn't it?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That's correct, Saul; it is.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. On the raw materials, when we talked about this 9% to 14% increase, I think what you are referring to is if we were to compare raw material cost in October of '08 with what they were in October of '07 as opposed to your total cost for fiscal '08 compared to your costs for fiscal '07; A: is that true? And then B: what would be the raw material cost increase that you incurred on average in the third quarter either compared to the third quarter a year ago or compared to the second quarter?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, first of all, the 9% to 14% is a point-to-point comparison. It's not the in-year impact if you will. Sequentially, I don't have that number off top of my head, but all I can tell you is that on a sequential basis second or third quarter continue to accelerate.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, Lori...", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well what was your question on others?", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "What was that?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "What was your other question?", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "The third quarter restructuring dollars.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, that one I had. So in third quarter, the restructuring that hits the cost of sales is about $2.8 million, that's the total of four. And then just an estimate in terms of the fourth quarter, it's somewhere around 50% to 55% of the fourth quarter charge will be in cost of sales.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. And the rest was in operating expense, is that right?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then within the segments, it seemed to be spread overall the different segments.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Do you have any idea on the raw material cost year-over-year say what the third quarter average might have been compared to third quarter year ago?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "As Bill said, it was accelerating.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Sorry Saul, we'll call you back on that. That's a level of granularity that I... we weren't expecting in the call.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And finally, in your guidance for the year, which would imply the fourth quarter earnings of $0.40 to $0.50 share, which we compared with $0.38 a year ago that's pretty strong performance. Now maybe remind us what went real bad last year? I think it's impact because of the easy comp, which showing that type of earnings progress in the markets that we are in is very, very impressive. But is there something about last year that may expect comparisons much easier than what you have experienced in each of the three quarters thus far?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well,the thing I do recall, Saul, is that we start into the fourth quarter last year. We took our inventories down in anticipation frankly of the environment that we are currently operating in. And we took them down during the fourth quarter and we paid a penalty for that in our earnings. Particularly, took them down in our architectural business. And your other point that's reality and it's well taken as it certainly an easier comp.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then finally, Lori, on the receivables compared to a year ago, you are up 14.5% yet; your revenues as you pointed out were up only 7.2%. What is that is going on the receivables that resulted in such a big increase relative to your increase in revenue?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, two things there are, Saul. One of them was... is just a timing in terms of when our quarter ended. And so we see in terms of that cash coming in the fourth quarter. The other as we do see some in terms of our receivables increasing because of our strength in the international operations and they tend to carry higher DSOs than our U.S. So you have a little bit of a mix issue there too.", "Saul Ludwig - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay, and there is one another thing. Okay. Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Saul.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we move on to Steve Schwatrz with First Analysis. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "It looks like your inventory values came down and off course with raw materials going up. I'm just wondering, what exactly is going on there? Is that part of the restructuring?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No, would you accept great management?", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Great management, okay.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "If we can go back to the answer I gave to the prior question, we did in the fourth quarter of last year make a strong focused effort to get our inventories down. And fundamentally, we have maintained that same discipline through the first three quarters of this year, Steve.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. And then that leads in my second question, which is on cash flow. With the numbers that you expect to post for the year, it looks like for the fourth quarter you would have to have an outstanding quarter in terms of cash generated so forth. Do you expect continue to get gains through working capital?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, we do. And as a matter of fact fourth quarter if you look in history, we typically generate the majority of our cash and working capital on the fourth quarter.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay, all right, so that I will continue. And then if you could just talk a little bit about some of the activities that are going on with the re-branding as it relates to media or personnel and relative to what you were doing last year. So in other words, do you still have personnel in the stores at the same level? Are you continuing to do the post card mailers and TV campaign so forth?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "We are, Steve. I would tell you that with respect to your specific observation of people in the stores, that... we have something in the hundreds of what we call field service representatives that call on low stores. Historically, all we have and always will. And there was no what I would tell you discernable ramp up in field service representatives as a result of branding. We continue to provide we think outstanding service at store level.", "Now our TV is more... a little more focused this year. There is a little less what I will call national TV and little more focus particularly in the cable area and shows that DIYers like to watch. But other than that, we continue to invest and we are really pleased with the progress that we have made.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. And then Lori, just if you could clarify for me, I think when you were discussing EBIT margins in the segments; you threw out an ex-restructuring, EBIT margin of 9.5%. I think that related to the paint segment, is that true?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. Thank you all.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Youare welcome, Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Good morning everybody. A couple of questions as most of my questions have been answered. When you talked about packaging business doing well, can you kind of quantify that in terms of low single digit to mid-single digit type of a comment?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I believe, Dmitry, it's high single digit.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "High single digit? And that excludes currency, that's just organic growth or does that include currency?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That's organic.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "That's organic, okay. And given that this is more of an international business for you, and even perhaps some of the other businesses, we could assume that the contribution from currency was little bit higher than corporate average, which you've given out?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That will be correct.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, great. And then second question: you've been increasing pricing something less than 1% or in the neighborhood of 1% year-over-year-over the past several quarters. You are experiencing double-digit pricing increases on our cost side, and the raw materials side. Looking at this dynamic going forward, is it reasonable to expect that your gross margins will continue to deteriorate or is there a point, whereyou will think you will be able to at least maintain the profit dollarand then hopefully get to a profit margin maintenance?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes,I think two answers: number one, our expectation is our gross margin will in the fourth quarter will hold with roughly the third quarter level. Number two, I don't think it's correct in saying that over the last several quarters that our pricing has only been in the one, particularly in the third quarter, significantly higher than one. So I would tell you that what that picture would paint, for the first three quarters of the year, is a momentum building.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, let me go back to that. You talked about roughly a 4% increase in foreign exchange and roughly 4% increase in acquisitions. And you've delivered about 7% over all growth. So, it was price... was volume down mid single digit, it sounds like or maybe even high signal digits in that scenario to get better than 1% pricing?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It be more than that, mid-single digit, because again the sequential change from third quarter to fourth quarter was negative 2.6% was our core in the third quarter and is actually positive this quarter, and the bulk of that is pricing.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. So you had a negative mid-single digit volume. And I think, Lori, you said that the paint volume was also mid-single digit down year-over-year. Did I hear that correct?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hold on. Yes, actually I said it was up slightly.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. So if the paint business was up slightly, then you must have had a pretty significant decline in the industrial coatings with packaging and some of the general industrial being stronger, would that bad?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, coatings was actually takeout currency was up low single digit.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "I am talking about volume. I am trying to get a handle on volumes. Is that volume... it sounds like they were down mid-single digit. The architectural volumes, I thought you said were down mid-single digit, but maybe I miss heard.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No... yes, that's probably close enough. The place, where the demand, where the volumes are way down or in other.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Yes, okay. So, in another and probably in wood as well?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That would be correct.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, that would be correct.", "D. Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, all right. Thank you, that's... thank you for that level of detail.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome, Dmitry.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Mike Hamilton with RBC. Please go ahead.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Mike.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "One just clarification on Huarun, were you saying that the revenue was up in high teens in the quarter?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I don't think... I don't quite remember saying that, but I believe that is correct.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Okay. What I thought I had heard you say was high double-digits.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I did, sorry, you are absolutely right.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "I'd likely the misinterpretation better. Could you give a little bit of perspective on what you've accomplished tactically was in Huarun over the last six to nine months?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "On a tactical basis, I would tell you I believe that we've strengthened our architectural distribution. And we further penetrated into Chinese furniture manufacturers and they would the two things. The Tier, Tier II, and Tier III says is to our strategy and we still... we are making progress there in penetration.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "What kind of end store gross are you showing at this stage?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You know what? I can't your answer your question frankly.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Okay.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Let us get back to you. We have to search through some numbers to get to that.", "Michael A. Hamilton - RBC Dain Rauscher", "Okay, thanks Bill. That's all for me.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from David Taylor with DP Taylor & Company [ph]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Bill, in your prepared remarks, you said you were happy with the results of your branding. Can you put a little flesh on that bone?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think there are several aspects to it. Number one: we continue to track our consumer awareness and improvement in consumer awareness. And we are tracking exactly as we had hoped and expected in improving consumer awareness increasing those metrics. And quite frankly, I think our results speak for themselves in terms of how our paint segment performed in the third quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okey doke. Thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we do have a follow-up question from Rosemarie Morbelli with Ingalls & Snyder. Please, go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Bill, could you give us a better feels for the new businesses that you said you were getting within the industrial side?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Probably I can't, Rosemarie. If we recall, I've been taking about this for three quarters that as we entered into a slower U.S. economy, we refused to accept the promise that in a slowing economy you cannot grow your sales, but there still is new business that can be achieved to the through the capitalizing with our technology and our positions in a number of our businesses. And our folks took that challenge on. And so I would tell you that from our cross... a number of businesses and across full product lines, where we've been able to, I think report reasonably good results in a tough economic climate, because our people took the challenge on, yes, you can grow your business during a slowdown.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. And then vis-\u00e0-vis the packaging business.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "They are articles about eliminating certain of the coatings inside the can. Does that affect since you are one big player in that particular area? Does it affect your business or do you have alternatives?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "We've been, Rosemarie, we've been investing for a long, long time in the packaging business. I... the competency in that business is technology. Technology is the differentiator. And with specific regard to what you're referencing, we've been investing and developing alternative coatings for the past 10 years to 15 years, and feel we are in good position.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. And if I may ask one last question, what do you see happening in Western Europe? Is it slowing across the board as I seem to be reading and is the pick up or the growth in Eastern Europe enough to more than offset the decline in the Western side?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Not sure, I'm right person to answer that question. Our biggest business in Europe is our packaging or can coatings business, which I talked about earlier, is relatively immune to the ups and downs. So I am not sure that in our other businesses automotive refinish, which is doing quite well. I'm not sure I am in a good position in terms of visibility to comment on a general slow down or not in Europe.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay. And if I could just have one clarification from Lori, company wide, Lori, the volume and price, did I understand properly, I mean did I translate properly that you most likely had company wide about 5% decline in volume and price increases of 6% or those are wrong numbers?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That's roughly right.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have a follow up question from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Hi. I think I may have modeled a couple of numbers that I heard before. Lori, did you say that your cash flow from operations for the quarter was $40 million to $50 million and your cash flow from operations from the nine months was $105 million to $110 million?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's in that... these are both estimates, Jeff, because we haven't completed that piece of it, that's both are roughly right.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "But for the first two quarters, the cash flow from operations was only about $26 million. So even if you talk to the $50 million on the top end of your range, you will be at $75 million, and you be $30 million to $35 million short of your nine month cash flow from operations. So what accounts for that big gap?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Wait, I will stand correct it. Third quarter for operating cash flow has been doing free cash flow, so that was the difference.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It'scloser to $80 million, Jeff. Somewhere between $80 million and $85 million is an estimate.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Somewhere between $80 million and $85 million. So, if your net income was $47 million and say depreciation and amortization were $20 million, so that $67 million. So to get to $80 million, you would have to have positive working capital so that your payables go up a lot?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, I am giving you the estimate at the moment again. We will have our Q out here a little while. We have not completed our forecast flow. So these are best estimates at this point and time.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Sure. And what you've done is you have successfully brought down your CapEx this year without call it $45 million from roughly $77 million last year. What are your capital needs going forward. Your capital needs have to go up in '09 or can you keep them around where they are sort of how do you see your general capital plan?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, if we go back probably four years or five years ago, we were spending in the rate of about $60 million a year CapEx.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Yes.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Then we ramped it to $80 million, and we held that level for a couple of years; now is the right thing improved though [ph]. We felt the prudent thing this year was to take it back. I would tell you that for internal planning purposes on a going forward basis, we probably think up near the $80 million number is the right number.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Right, okay. And then lastly in general what was your coatings volume in the quarter?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It was also down in that low single digit.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Down low single digit. Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we move onto Steve Schwartz with First Analysis. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Bill, some companies in the industry go after their price increases in just very distinct ways. Have you done it that same way? And if so can you give us an idea of when you've been doing those over the past 12 months?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Steve,I very really do this. I would before not to answer the question for a lot of reasons. How we elected to implement our pricing strategies is unique to the market segments and some market segments in which we operate, and I'm just not comfortable commenting on that in a public forum.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay, understood.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, sir; appreciate your understanding.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have no further questions.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, everyone; thank you. That was a full and fulsome discussion as we like to say. Just let me summarize. We reaffirmed our full year guidance; we continue to raise our price. We are taking the appropriate actions to improve our cost structure. We are very pleased with the progress in our brand building programs. And our business outside the U.S. continues to perform well.", "So thank you. And thank you for your interest, and we'll talk to you again in November at our fourth quarter earnings call. Have a good day everyone.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentleman, this conference will be available for replay after 12:00 PM today until August 25th at midnight. If you may access the AT&T Executive Playback Service at anytime by dialing 1-800-475-6701, and entering the access code 956044. Again the number was 1-800-475-6701 with the access code of 956044.

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams company's review of the third quarter 2008 financial results and expectations for the fourth quarter and full year.", "With us on today\u2019s call are Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO; Sean Hennessy, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; John Ault, Vice President Corporate Controller; and Bob Wells, Vice President Corporate Communications.", "The company has provided information regarding the third quarter and first nine months financial results.

After the company's opening remarks, we will open the session to questions.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, John. Good morning everybody. Summarizing overall company performance for third quarter 2008 versus third quarter 2007, consolidated net sales increased 3.3% to $2.27 billion. Acquisitions increased sales 1.7% in the quarter and favorable foreign currency translation rate changes added nine-tenth of a percent.", "Consolidated gross profit decreased by $27.9 million for the quarter to $960.5 million. Gross margin decreased 270 basis points to 42.3% of sales, from 45% last year. The reduction in gross margin was primarily due to higher raw material costs, lower manufacturing volumes and expenses associated with the closing of certain manufacturing and distribution facilities during the quarter, which were all partially offset by higher selling prices.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales for the quarter to 30% from 30.5% last year. Due primarily, to tight spending controls. Interest expense, net of interest and investment income, was $14.3 million, compared to $15.2 million last year, due to a year-over-year reduction in average affective interest rates.", "Consolidated profit before taxes for the third quarter decreased $28.2 million or 9.6% to $266.1 million, due entirely to the reduction in gross profit. Our tax rate for the quarter was 33.5%, compared to 31.9% in the third quarter of 2007. We expect our effective tax rate for the full year to be roughly flat with last year at 33%.", "Consolidated net income for the quarter decreased by $23.3 million or 11.6% to $177.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales for the third quarter was 7.8% compared to 9.1% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter, decreased 3.2% to $1.50 per share compared to $1 55 per share in the third quarter of 2007. Acquisitions and currency translation changes together added approximately $0.04 to diluted net income per common share for the quarter.", "Looking at our results by operating segments; sales for our Paint Stores Group increased to $9.5 million or seven-tenth of a percent to $1.41 billion in the third quarter 2008. This increase was due primarily to acquisitions completed since the third quarter last year which added 1.5% to sales, and price increases.", "These two factors were partially offset by lower volume sales during the quarter. Comparable store sales, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months decreased 1.4% in the quarter compared to third quarter last year. End market demand remained soft across most architectural coating segments during the quarter with no material change in sales momentum month-to-month.", "Regionally in the third quarter our mid-western division led the sales performance followed by eastern, southwestern and southeastern. Three of the four divisions achieved positive sales growth in the quarter. Segment profit for the group decreased $7.4 million or 3% to $241 million. Operating margin decreased to 17.1% of sales from 17.7% in the third quarter last year due primarily to increased product costs that could not be fully offset by price increases and positive contribution from acquisitions.", "In the Consumer Group for third quarter '08 sales increased $6.2 million or 1.8% to $355.7 million. This was due primarily to selling price increases and volume gains as some of the segment\u2019s larger retail customers. An acquisition completed in 2007 added four-tenths of a percent to sales in the quarter.", "Consumer segment profit decreased $37.8 million or 59% to $26.3 million in the quarter. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 7.4%, from 18.4% in the quarter, prior year, primarily due to higher raw material costs, lower volume throughput in manufacturing and distribution operations, and expenses associated with the closing of certain manufacturing and distribution facilities that were all partially offset by tight SG&A control. Acquisitions had no impact on segment profits for the quarter.", "Turning to our Global Group for third quarter \u201808, net sales in US dollars increased $55.8 million or 12.5%, to $500.8 million. Acquisitions increased Global Group sales in the third quarter by 3.1% in US dollars. Stated in local currency, sales grew by 8% in the quarter, due primarily to volume gains, selling price increases, and acquisitions completed since third quarter last year.", "Segment profit for the Global Group in US dollars decreased $2.7 million or 5.6% to $45.3 million. Segment profit as a percent of net sales declined to 9% from 10.8% last year. This decrease in the segment's profit in the quarter was mostly attributable to increased raw material costs and the negative impact of a soft domestic economy on portions of the segment's business. That could not be fully offset by volume gains outside the US, and price increases.", "Turning to some balance sheet items, our total debt on September 30, 2008 was $1.0268 billion. Short-term borrowings increased $59.6 million to $715.9 million compared to third quarter last year. Total borrowings to capitalization were 37.1% at the end of the quarter versus 34.2% at the end of third quarter 2007. Long-term debt to capitalization was 15.2% at the end of the third quarter this year compared to 14.2% last year.", "Our cash balance at September 30, 2008, was $40.9 million compared to $21.2 million in 2007. During the third quarter the company acquired 793,000 shares of its common stock from the open market, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately seven million shares. On September 30, 2008 the company had remaining authorization, to purchase 20 million shares.", "In third quarter 2008, we spent $20.9 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $36.2 million, amortization expense was $6.2 million. For the full year '08, capital expenditures will be $125 million to $140 million, depreciation will be about $145 million versus $139 million in 2007 and amortization will be $23 million versus $24.5 million in '07.", "I will conclude my comments, with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In Rhode Island defendants have filed a motion in the Superior Court to recover certain expenses related to the trial including fees paid to court appointed co-examiners, certain deposition costs, travel expenses and expenses related to expert testimony. In Ohio, the Ohio Attorney General suit, which was removed to Federal Court by the defendants, has been remanded back to State Court by a federal judge. We do not expect activity in this case until at least late November, following the election of a new Attorney General.", "In Wisconsin, the Thomas case, a personal injury case tried successfully to a jury last fall, has been appealed by the plaintiffs. Briefing is now taking place, although it is unlikely that the case will be heard this year. Another individual plaintiff case has been heard on appeal, by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, on the question of whether lead pigment is an inherently defective product. A decision should come out in the fourth quarter of this year or first quarter of 2009.", "In California the state Supreme Court has agreed to consider the question of whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingent fee counsel to aid them in their suit against the former manufacturers of lead pigment. Briefing is on going and oral arguments should not take place until at least the second quarter of 2009 with a decision some months after that.", "Finally in Mississippi the trial in the Gaines case has been delayed until June 17, 2009. This case involves as single plaintiff adolescent. There are currently a number of procedural and this dispositive motion pending before the court and it is not expected that they will be decided any time soon.", "That concludes my review of the quarter. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the balance of the year. Chris?", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Bob and good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Third quarter 2008 turned out to be better than we had anticipated. Both sales and earnings per share for the quarter exceeded our guidance, due primarily to marginally to stronger performance at some of our larger retail accounts, the successful implementation of some of the price increases we have announced over the past three quarters and tight expense control.", "Despite this performance we're not satisfied with these results given some key metrics that are still moving in the wrong direction; sales volumes, gross margin and net income for example. However we did make significant progress in some very important areas of our business specifically our control of SG&A, organic store openings, management of working capital and as always cash generation.", "Our ongoing efforts here at Sherwin to trim fat and build muscle across the company continued in the third quarter and help to offset the effects of a falling demand and rising input costs. During the quarter we continue to close redundant store locations and controlled our store service expense by reducing scheduled overtime and part time hours. Consolidated SG&A expense for the quarter increased by only $11 million, compared to the third quarter of '07, as Bob previously mentioned, actually declined by 50 basis points, as a percent of sales.", "In the third quarter our Paint Stores Group opened 18 new stores and closed 12. So far this year we have opened 57 new locations, and closed 74 for a net reduction to 17 stores. Our store count in the United States, Canada and Caribbean now stands at 3,308 locations. For the full year of 2008 our Paint Stores Group remains on track to open approximately 100 new locations and close about 80, finishing the year with a net store increase in the range of 20 locations. Our Global Finishes Group added 10 new facilities in the third quarter bringing their branch additions for the year to 22, and the total store count to 541 locations.", "We also made progress in our management of working capital during the quarter. At the end of the September our working capital ratio defined as accounts receivable plus inventories less payable for sales, was down 140 basis points to 13% of sales compared to 14.4% last year. The combination of responsive production planning, mainly holding inventories in line with sales volumes and prudent management of receivables and payables reduced our networking capital by $92 million since the end of the third quarter last year.", "Compared to the first nine months of '07, year-to-date net operating cash increased by almost $29 million to $593 million despite a drop in net income. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash minus CapEx and dividends increased by $53 million to $377 million as a result of increase in net operating cash and lower CapEx spending in the first nine months.", "I touched on some aspects of our business that are moving in the right direction. Let me count briefly and some things that are not moving in the right direction, beginning with the weakness in our sales volume in the quarter and year-to-date. To prove that we are not immune to the significant downturn in both the domestic and worldwide coatings demand, although we\u2019re committed to keeping costs in line with sales, we believe the best response to declining volume is to continue to expand our controlled distribution platform into new markets, as well as to continue to develop and launch new innovative products and services, and we\u2019re doing both of these.", "Our margins also moved in the wrong direction in the third quarter again due primarily to the persistently high raw material costs. The recent reversal in crude oil and natural gas prices have begun to positively impact raw material pricing, but we have a long way to go before input costs return to late '07 levels. It's likely that year-over-year raw material pricing for the industry will still be up in the low end of our range of 9% to 14%. Successful implementation of the price increases announced earlier this year and selective reductions in manufacturing.", "Improving capacities are vital for improving margin performance in future periods. Liquidity is another issue on everyone's mind. So I have asked Sean Hennessy our Chief Financial Officer to take a few moments to comment briefly on our liquidity sources. Sean?", "Sean Hennessy", "Thanks, Chris. Good morning everyone. We have two liquidity sources for short-term credit that totaled $1.9 billion. A $910 million credit facility that we used to back our commercial paper dollar-for-dollar and a $1 billion revolving and letter of credit facility from Citibank. Today we are using withdrawals from our $1 billion revolving credit facility for 80% to 90% of our short-term needs and meeting the remainder of our needs in the commercial paper market.", "The combination of our internal cash flow draws from the revolver facility and the rolling of commercial paper will satisfy our current and future liquidity needs. Our short-term debt balance at year end a year amount is projected to be $575 million. Our first quarter short-term liquidity needs, they are projected will peak at $790 million, which is below either liquidity source and well below the combined source of $1.9 billion. We are well positioned to meet any liquidity needs for the company. Chris?", "Chris Connor", "If we look ahead, the final quarter of 2008 will be a challenging one. Worldwide demand is likely to continue to deteriorate and we expect an input cost pressure is likely to persist as the raw material price increases already announced work their way through the supply chain.", "Our outlook for fourth quarter 2008 is for consolidated net sales growth in percentage terms to be in the range of plus or minus low single digits, compared to last year's fourth quarter. With sales at this level, we expect diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.60 per share compared to $0.80 per share for the fourth quarter of last year.", "For the full year 2008, we expect consolidated net sales to be slightly above 2007. Annual sales at that level we are raising our expectations for diluted net income per common share for the year to be in the range of $3.97 to $4.17 per share compared to $4.70 per share last year.", "Yesterday our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.35 per share, continuing towards our long standing practice of paying out approximately 30% of prior year's earnings per share and marking our 30th consecutive year of increased dividends.", "One final note, planning for 2009 is currently in progress, we will be prepared to provide you with sales and earnings expectations for next year during our year end conference call scheduled for late January. Again we would like to thank all of you for joining us this morning and now we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Good morning. Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "", "Good morning Eric", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Just a couple of things, in terms of the progress on the SG&A looks quite impressive, on the gross margin line the deterioration looks like it was a little worse in 3Q than we saw in 2Q on a year-over-year basis. Can you help us understand; number one, the incremental progress with price and contribution of price in the quarter versus what we saw in 2Q. And then secondly, can you help us understand why gross margins behaved as they did and how we should expect that going forward in the current price cost?", "Sean Hennessy", "", "Okay, couple of things there Eric. First on the pricing, when we look at the pricing progress that we are making with the price increases, we feel pretty good. I would say that the third quarter on the stores group we continue to show the improvement that we have expected in the past. And it's really in line. I would tell you that the reason why the margin was a little short. In the last quarter someone asked me and I said that the margin would be in the 42 to 43 to range.", "And really the LIFO expense was a little higher than expected in the third quarter and our margin also reflected the cost of closing some logistics operations that Bob mentioned during his comments. So without that we would have been right in that range. We would have been just short of that range. So, pricing is doing just like we had expected and so forth.", "When you look at the fourth quarter margins, we expect that the margin will be down in the fourth quarter. So we are probably not going to give you guidance this quarter as exactly where we are going to be. We are not going to give that kind of a range, but it will be below last year, but the pricing we are pretty comfortable is going well.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "In terms of putting some numbers around that can you give us a sense of what either in total or in the stores group the contribution from price was in the quarter. And also can you give us any sense of the one time costs that you ran through the P&L in both stores and consumers --", "Chris Connor", "Sure, pricing for the quarter in the stores group we can help you with that, Eric. As you know from the report, we are up slightly in that segment, and volumes were down in the high single-digit range.", "Sean Hennessy", "", "When you ask about the incremental costs in there, we do have in the Consumer Group, the cost of closing some logistic operations and so forth. As I just mentioned we came in at 42.3, and we told we are going to be net 42.8 versus 43.2, so I told you without it we would be at the low end of that. So, it's half a percent were sales is pretty much just short of that.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Then lastly in terms of the, you commented that you didn't want to give guidance up 42 on gross margin, and I understand how LIFO and FIFO really have a different impact based on the size of the quarter, which showed a year-over-year decline and gross margin should 3Q here be the trough and should we start to see some recovery quarter-to-quarter as we move forward from this point?", "Sean Hennessy", "", "There is a lot of different moving parts in the margin in the fourth quarter. It's not just LIFO, it's a lot of other things. We take a year end inventory in our stores, we evaluate different things. We really don't want to give that specific guidance. Probably, we'll give a little more color at the end of the fourth quarter and then give you a little more guidance for '09 in the January call as Chris mentioned.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay, very good. Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Eric.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amy Zhang with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Amy Zhang - Goldman Sachs", "The first question for the segment profit margins we see, for this quarter we see big divergence between Paint Stores with 17% and the consumer which reported about 7.4%? Can you just provide some color why we see that big difference? Also, secondly for the Consumer segment margins, I think is close to the historical lows. If we look at the trends over the past several years, do you think it has troughed or how we should think about the trend for that segment going forward?", "Chris Connor", "Consumer group margins Amy are really driven up on two distinct different issues. One is the ability for this group to get pricing with their customers as they move their products through our third party retailers. We've commented on this call, as well as past calls the pricing activity there is proceeding as we would expect it to. The bigger impact in the quarter is that the second impact for the Consumer Group is their margins are impacted by the volume that goes through the supply chain part of our company.", "As the stores volume has softened throughout the year and as we just commented to Eric's question, backwards in the quarter, high single-digits. The impact on this segments\u2019 margins is seen with the numbers you speak of.. Whether or not we've troughed will be determined on the kind of volume gains we see going forward. If we can start to moderate and see a little lift in that, those margins will come back up to the historic run levels.", "Amy Zhang - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, thank you. And my second, actually my third question is, the Paint Store Group reported the 1.4% decline in comp store sales in 3Q versus 3.9% decline for the first three quarters. Wondering, can you just give us a little bit more color on the underlying trends? Have you seen that underlying demand stabilized well still at that low level or is more like, more of a function of easy comps?", "Chris Connor", "I think we are seeing the impact of the price increases Amy, work through the segment. Volumes have been consistently poor through the segment for the year.", "Amy Zhang - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, then. Can we assume in terms of pricing gains has already peaked in the third quarter and maybe the second half of this year?", "Chris Connor", "I think the pricing gains have continued to go in, as we've certainly said they do. Our last price increase for this segment was announced early in the third quarter. And it typically takes us two or three quarters to get the full implementation, so there is still pricing to come in the segment.", "Amy Zhang - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Amy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "Good morning. This is [Shelka Cook] for Jeff. How are you?", "Bob Wells", "Hi Shelka.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "Couple of questions, you said that you have had sort of some volume gains at larger retailers, said the affect of gaining some share or suggest that the (inaudible) business is just doing better versus your professional market, professional painters market?", "Chris Connor", "I think that, it's a little of both, primarily the former that we have been seeing from share gains.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "Okay. Secondly, can you talk about how the commercial business has held up whether that's begun to slow and how much readability do you have going into 2009?", "Chris Connor", "As we have commented before the commercial business has been slow over the course of the year. Commercial square footage is down significantly like in the high 20% range. Rate of decline in August was about the same, about 27%. It suggests that we're not seeing further deterioration in the commercial market just continued weakness.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "In terms of your raw material, did you expect the raw material to be flat or down etcetera?", "Chris Connor", "We haven't commented on that yet. I think our plans are taking shape and our discussions with our vendors are occurring and we'll be happy at that January call to give you our best look at the guidance for industry [raws] for next year.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "How about the fourth quarter then. Do you think that, the current pull back and oil and gas cost will make a difference to the type of life of --?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. Again as we commented we're seeing some of the softening in the raw material input costs for us. We are now guiding you to the low end of our range of 9% to 14% for the industry. I would remind you that we are on the back half of a very traditional looking bell curve for paint demand in North America and any softening in raw material costs will have a very little affect for us this year. We are winding down production, we are holding inventories flat. This is a period of time we are not really acquiring a lot of raw materials.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "Maybe two more questions. There was a reduction in corporate expenses in the third quarter. Will we see something similar in the fourth quarter?", "Chris Connor", "When you take a look at it, we were down around $20 million, if you go through the details you would see that really it's 70% of that decline was really the environmental expense that we had versus last year. We think that that's pretty much annualized now and when you look at the fourth quarter we, right now we are looking at it it's not showing that kind of improvement in the fourth quarter being relatively flat to the fourth quarter last year.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "Okay, and then lastly, you are still generating a lot of free cash flow, and stuff like large share repurchase still available. How do you plan to spend the free cash that you generate?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think the share authorization that's remaining is exactly what it should be. We tend to get large chunks from the Board and it takes us a number of years to get through that. So the $20 million that are out there, by no stretch of imagination will we be bringing those in throughout the reminder of this year or even next year. We will continue to use cash as we have historically. To the extent there are M&A opportunities we will look to take advantage of that, but I think our cash usage for the year are pretty well set.", "Shelka Cook - JP Morgan", "Okay, thanks. I will get back in the queue.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Shelka.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with FTN Midwest. Please proceed with your question.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities", "First question Chris. In looking at these distribution manufacturing facilities that were closed during the third quarter, what did that relate to; was it redundant equipment, or are these permanent closures or is it just temporary due to demand?", "Chris Connor", "No Chuck these are facilities that we've announced that we will be closing permanently and disposing of the assets. The vast majority of them have come from recent acquisitions that we've made in the Stores Group.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay. Somebody just asked little bit about the stock repurchase, Sean, what is kind of your feeling given the current credit market where Sherwin-Williams should be positioned or thinking about, and maybe you can put it in light of how you repurchase stock during the third quarter was it bit of more aggressive in the early part of the quarter versus the latter part?", "Sean Hennessy", "Actually it was probably the midpoint Chuck, when stock prices first came down, but we felt during the first half of the year we had purchased the majority of the stock that we're going to buy for the year when we were looking at our cash as deterioration of the credit. As I mentioned when you sit there and take a look at the thoughts of having around $575 million projected on short-term debt, which would take our total debt into that 950 to 975 range, that you could see that really the majority of the stock has been purchased and we think it's more prudent for us to be in a situation with our stock at the price it is today. It's still a good buy. But we're going to make sure our balance sheet and our liquidity sources are fine for the year. I would say that you're looking at a very similar type of quarter in the fourth versus the third.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities", "In terms of the credit markets.", "Sean Hennessy", "And the number of shares we purchased.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities", "Alright. What's the acquisition environment like right now. Not everybody has liquidity resources that Sherwin-Williams has.", "Chris Connor", "Well as we've commented in the past. Particularly in North America, when we look to do controlled distribution opportunities, given the downturn in the market. It's now particularly, good times for these privately held businesses to come on to market. We don't think there is going to be much activity there. Opportunities for perhaps some troubled assets here and abroad are still out there. However, cost of money to get them has gone up significantly. I think the company still has terrific access given the liquidity position Sean took you through to access the capital markets. If we had an interest but the costs, is certainly gone up dramatically and that will I have a chilling affect.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities", "Got you. And finally, Chris, any positive signs out there in any of your markets?", "Chris Connor", "Well, I think the year has continued to show some strength for our protective finishes businesses, the industrial maintenance and marine category. We are seeing nice performance in our Latin America operations, but the domestic architectural businesses are still under quite a bit of stress and we don't see any end insight.", "Chuck Cerankosky - FTN Midwest Securities", "Alright. Thank you very much.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, Chuck.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Saul Ludwig with Keybanc. Please proceed with your question.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Hello.", "Chris Connor", "How are you Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Can you just give a little more color on the first on the Consumer Group. The degree of earnings compression is kind of what I want to focus on. The trends and volume as you said Chris was weak all year. Your inter segment transfers, year-over-year have been very similar throughout the all three quarters. But the percept for this drop in earnings in the third quarter, is that more than it would be in let's say fourth quarter? Could you just elaborate a little more on what was special and what drove the numbers down so much?", "Sean Hennessy", "Saul when you take a look at it, the third quarter what we've commented in the past is that each quarter the amount of the experience of raw materials continues to rise. So third quarter the raws were higher in the third quarter than it is in either the first or second quarter. Secondly, you could imagine that because of our capacity situations what ends up happening in the second and third quarter were usually really producing at a 100% volume on a daily basis.", "We did get our inventory down. We made sure our inventory is down because of the volume. So, the third quarter probably in any one quarter has probably felt that greatest reduction in the volume going throughput from the plants in the [BOC] side in quarter one and two. Quarter four which is usually a situation whereby we start to, we're used to bringing down that volume coming through the plants. I think that it won't be as dramatic in the fourth quarter, but we still have it going through.", "Finally we have mentioned that they did take the one, took some of logistic facilities out from the, from the acquisitions that Chris mentioned from the most recent acquisition. So they had to take that hit. So, that's really what caused it to be the greatest. Last year in the fourth quarter our operating margin was 94, this third quarter was 74. It probably will be less in the third quarter but the difference which was down almost 11% in the third quarter, I just don't see it being that large in the fourth quarter.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Closing these facilities, I guess you already said it was 0.5% on the gross margins, so that would be kind of like about the 10 million bucks or so.", "Sean Hennessy", "I think it was, we combined that with the incremental LIFO that we took to try to get, I think it's just short of that between the two.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Only that have all been in the consumer division?", "Sean Hennessy", "Consumer would have taken, probably the majority of it, well, high percentage of it, yes.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "So, if we added back that 10 million bucks, the decline then would have been commensurate with what we saw in first half of the year.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Then you are saying in the third quarter it's going to be more like the first half of the year decline rather than the precipitated drop in the third quarter.", "Chris Connor", "The fourth quarter you mean,", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, the fourth quarter.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Then the next question I have is on the global group you did sell $55 million more products. And you would have thought you had made some gross profit on that $55 million of more sales, yet your profits fell. I just wanted to get a little more color on what's happening there and what might happen as we move forward?", "Sean Hennessy", "Two things really. In Bob's comments, he commented that we did see some sales weakness and volume weakness in the domestic markets that are in the global group. I would tell you the profitability on the domestic piece is a little higher than we have outside the United States for scale and other reasons that we have, and then also we started to see currency hits in the global group.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "And how do you see that plan out in the fourth quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "In the fourth quarter, we do believe that the margin last year we came in at 8% [ROS] last year. We think that in the third quarter we were down, I'm sorry we came in at 3%. We do think that we'll see a little improvement there.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "", "What was 3%?", "Sean Hennessy", "", "3% was the ROS for the fourth quarter '07 in the Global group.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "I had 6.3%.", "Sean Hennessy", "You probably have added back a piece of impairment we took. That was associated with that.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "", "And you made $28 million in the Global group last year in the fourth quarter.", "Sean Hennessy", "", "Okay. So I would say that you're not going to see the sharp decline that we had in the third quarter.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "", "Okay. Great. And then finally on the volume, if you look at the percentage decline that you saw in your comp stores volume, do you think that gets worse in the fourth quarter or basically stays at about whatever the decline was in the third quarter.", "Chris Connor", "We don't think it gets worse at all, I think we're feeling the brunt of the market right now. Time will tell whether it starts to come off of that. But we don't think it worse.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Finally I think on your last conference call, Chris, you've presented a pretty pessimistic view in that when you were talking about the downdraft in earnings that you were going to experience in the second half of the year. I think you extended that expectation to the first quarter as well. Do you still feel as pessimistic about the first quarter, given the relief that you're seeing on raw materials to the degree that you did when you last commented on it?", "Chris Connor", "No we are not seeing any movement in the demand for volume which is the key driver for the company. And just premature for us to comment on the first quarter, we'll be happy to do that in January.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks [Don].", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, thank you. Couple of questions, Chris, where do you think we are in the architectural coatings downturn? You said, you didn't see any improvement. I think you talked in the past, both total industry being down perhaps 8% to 10% this year. I mean, have we broadened the sense of the comps get easier next year and you're not going to see that, that kind of further decline if you can outline how you see volumes for the industry going forward?", "Chris Connor", "Well, I think Don everything that we read would indicate that the housing market is still way too early to call the end. While existing home turnover which is a key driver for us, is starting to show some life. There is an awful lot of foreclosure activity in there, which really shouldn't give us much confidence because it's not the kind of existing cum turnover that we typically need to see the drive demand for coatings.", "New residential constructions, again not quite sure if that flattens out or declines further, but we know for a fact that the commercial construction tends to lag the residential market. So we would expect to that be down as well. So, we think it's way too early to comment that the end of the softness in declining year-over-year architectural coatings demand is at hand, and for that reason 2009 could be a soft year for the company as well.", "Sean Hennessy", "Another, just to add to that, Don. Recently it's been pretty well publicized that consumer spending is weakening. And although it's not as large a portion of our business as it is with the industry in total. The DIY market could soften further.", "Don Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So basically only good news is that, maybe the comps get easier.", "Chris Connor", "Correct.", "Don Carson - Merrill Lynch", "On pricing in the Consumer group. I mean obviously some of your larger customers there, they follow raw materials pretty closely. We are seeing some key [raws] start to break like propylene into the acrylics chain. Are you getting any pressure back from those customers to start cutting prices inline with raw materials since it was basically rising [raws] that drove the price increases or at least for the rational for the price increases?", "Chris Connor", "No, Don, we wouldn't comment specifically on any one customer. But as a segment, we would comment that we have been taking pricing activity to the market, it's taken us longer to get that pricing than it has in other segments. Sean's comments on some of the way the margins has flowed throughout the year. And I think it's early to determine whether or not we're going to see price pressure coming back from those guys.", "Don Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. A final question. Sean, you mentioned that normally Q2, Q3 you're running about a 100% operating rate on the manufacturing. And how weak was the operating rate in the third quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "It was probably in the high 80s or 90s.", "Don Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Right, okay. And then you mentioned normally Q4 is quite weak. What is Q4 normally and then, you said it might be a little better this year?", "Sean Hennessy", "Well, what I meant by that is, yeah, usually in the fourth quarter we'll run around 75% of what we will run in the second and third quarter.", "Don Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And so you think it could come in a little better then?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. I mean, we're not going to see that 10% decline from that point.", "Don Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Right. Okay. Thank you.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thanks, Don.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "SG&A costs were pretty low this quarter. What do you see the run rate going forward specifically into 2009, are we going to be at these levels or were there some one-time items that depressed that number a little bit?", "Sean Hennessy", "No. I think Gregg, we are in the middle of planning process and what we're trying to do is avoid to give any kind of indication where we're going to be in '09. We'll comment that in January where we give the final fourth quarter and then also full year guidance for '09.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Sure. You did say your fourth quarter is going to be flat with last year, approximately?", "Chris Connor", "SG&A as a percent of sales.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Yes.", "Chris Connor", ". I think the cuts that we've made in SG&A are not one-time or unique in nature. They are the kind of really blocking [impact] and that we should be doing running a large retail organization. Given volume performance, if it comes in as predicted, SG&A will be flat for the quarter.", "Gregg Goodnight - UBS", "Okay. Second question, in the past you've said that your plan is to open about 100 stores a year through thick and thin, good times and bad. Is that still your position going into '09, are you going to open 100 stores in '09 or you're going to net out some closures also?", "Chris Connor", "Well, we are opening 100 stores this year and this is a thick or thin, I say. We got the 100 open in the thin part of that equation. Again, Sean and Bob's comments as well, we are not prepared today to give guidance for '09. Suffice to say the company will continue to be opening stores next year, as we build out that platform.", "Our long-term goals, we've commented frequently into the investment communities. 4,000 stores in North America is kind of the next mile marker along the path, we're just slightly over 3,300 locations. So, we will continue to be moving in that direction and we will give you guidance on the January call, in a range of the number that we expect to get done next year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve O'Neil with Hilliard Lyons. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "Just wanted to make sure I had this right. You were talking about the curtailment of manufacturing and distribution operations. And I thought I heard you say that, is that primarily in the consumer segment?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, the expense for that, that is 100% in the consumer group, that's where the expense was felt.", "Steve O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "So that was not really referring to closing of paint store locations that were redundant?", "Chris Connor", "Correct.", "Steve O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "Okay. Just wanted to make sure I had that straight. Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "You do.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Grassi with Longbow. Please proceed with your question.", "Jonathan Grassi - Longbow", "", "Good morning and thank you for taking my question.", "Jonathan Grassi - Longbow", "I guess first on your paint store pricing, obviously, you guys have implemented a reprice(?) increases so far this year. I guess with \u2013 I guess your consumers on a perception of raw materials falling. What is your expectation for being able to implement your traditional price increase in January?", "Chris Connor", "Well Jonathan, of course, we're not commenting on whether we're taking any pricing activity in 2009 at this point. As we have historically commented, that it takes us sometime to get pricing implemented to our system. The most recent price increase in the beginning of the third quarter, still being implemented as we speak and that's all we're really speaking to at this point.", "Jonathan Grassi - Longbow", "Okay. I know you guys said you were just entering into negotiations for our raw material costs for next year. But I was just hoping you could just maybe comment a little bit on the titanium dioxide pricing, obviously, we've heard that price increases that have been announced by the titanium dioxide producers throughout 2008 have not really been realized.", "But now that some of the other producers are getting behind some of these price increases they are expecting to start realizing some price increase. So I guess, could you comment on that?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. We have seen as you have, some noise surrounding titanium pricing, yet still to come in the back half of 2008. Those numbers are baked into the industry guidance that we're giving of 9% to 14%. And to your point about some of them not having been successful, this year that's pretty typical for this industry, pricing is often announced and then various levels of it are either accepted or negotiated or many times they are not implemented at all.", "Jonathan Grassi - Longbow", "Okay. Thank you. And finally, just on the global group you begin about 3% to 4% revenue from acquisitions, when does that anniversary?", "Chris Connor", "In the global group, we actually completed an acquisition in third quarter in [Kemp]. So we will have acquisition sales all the way through the third quarter 2009.", "Jonathan Grassi - Longbow", "How much do you think that's going to add in the fourth quarter?", "Chris Connor", "I got to believe the fourth quarter would be right around the same amount in the third quarter, maybe it's slightly higher because of that acquisition. But we are going to annualize the few acquisitions in Uruguay, as well in Mexico in that group. But in the third quarter, acquisitions added 3%. And I would tell you that in fourth quarter would probably be in the same range.", "Jonathan Grassi - Longbow", "Okay. Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Good morning, everybody. Congratulations on probably the best quarter of any company will see this quarter. So you should be very happy.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Ivy.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "We're just trying to understand a little bit on the consumer margins were, obviously I'm sure not up to what you had hoped for but you definitely had the ability for pricing to go up and it seems that the consumer is taking the brunt of that. So kind of trying to understand, the volume versus price mix going forward and how far you think you can push it in this environment, with the consumers [who will test] it right now?", "Chris Connor", "You are talking about margins on the consumer side, Ivy. You are talking about the consumer group operating margins that were lower or our ability to get\u2026", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "I'm assuming that the topline was good, but margins were bad. So the topline, you got the topline was driven by strong price, right. So there seems to be a bit of a disconnection. So I'm just wondering\u2026", "Chris Connor", "Yes. I think we keep some of them back, we're trying to give as much color as we can to that the group's margin performance for the quarter and the significant impact that the low stores volume had on the operating side of the company, which is included in our consumer group. If we just look at the pricing activity of the consumer group marketing team, on those brands who are retailing partners, we have taken pricing as we've announced. We're pleased with the implementation of that. We are seeing the appropriate progress on that side of it. Until, we can start to get some volume coming back primarily to our stores organization, that segments going to be under margin pressure.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "I know I'm sorry, maybe I'm not asking the question directly right. I'm thinking more on a go forward basis, would you consider maybe reducing price to create more volume because the consumer is in such a very tough situation right now because then you could, you will get better utilization rates as volumes are better.", "Chris Connor", "That option clearly is always available to us. I think as we've commented frequently, the vast majority of the cost of these products is included in the raw material input. As those continue to stay high, we're likely not to see prices come down and that would be our approach to that as well.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "And I guess we should make assumptions if you get -- raw material relief that we'll see some of that maybe pass through to the consumer at some point?", "Chris Connor", "You can make whatever assumptions.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. Your comments I think were very frank regarding the commercial markets and how tough they are with volume down, you said north of 20%. Do you think that this is a just a interesting perspective from someone in your tenured position. How does this compare to the 2001-'03 downturn and do you think that the non-res maintenance demand does it play out any differently next year versus new non-res?", "Chris Connor", "The '01-'02 downturn for us in the commercial segment was really a maintenance product line that was under terrific stress, as corporate profits were tough, states and departments of transportation lacked the budget to maintain highways and bridges etc. This particular downturn as you know, has very little to do with that. And it's mostly on the housing side as it's trickled through and now affecting the commercial construction side as well too. So well that cycle turned around relatively quickly, this one seems to have much longer legs and as we've been commenting on the call, we think next year is a soft year as well.", "Ivy Zelman - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. Well, thanks, appreciate your answers, thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Ivy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Greg Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. Thanks, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Good Morning, Greg.", "Greg Melich - Morgan Stanley", "Good Morning. Just a follow-up on mix versus price and how you calculate that in there, if the volume was down like it was, high single-digits then we assume price was something similar to that on the other side. Was mix a help to that price or was it a negative given the DIY was stronger?", "Sean Hennessy", "What we've commented on is mix has been favorable again in this round of pricing. We have seen a positive mix for higher selling price products continually. If you break it down, just down into the different segments, we really don't go down that deep. But in total the mix was positive.", "Greg Melich - Morgan Stanley", "You haven't there seen any trend of consumers whether they'll be consumers or your pro-customers trading down at all?", "Sean Hennessy", "On the pro side not at all. On the DIY side, we do think that we're starting to see a little bit of trading down on the DIY side.", "Greg Melich - Morgan Stanley", "", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Robert Felice with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "Most of my questions have been answered, just couple of more. I guess first the dollar strength in over the last several weeks quite a bit and that's been a tailwind for a while. So could you highlight the impact of FX on Sherwin's P&L if that starts to go the other way?", "Chris Connor", "If you take a look at what we've done is our total debt structure we have approximately $100 million of non-domestic debt located in countries, sporadic around the countries, the countries that we have sales in. That debt is sort of dampened the affect of that on the P&L side. But because it's not one-for-one, it had a minimal affect on us in the third quarter and we think it's kind of minimal affect down us in the fourth quarter.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. So we shouldn't look at it as large headwind?", "Chris Connor", "Not on the P&L side -- not PBT side, on the sales side because what we end up happening as your sales does become a -- start to have little headwinds, but on the other side your debt comes down and on the balance sheet side you get some relief from that.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "", "Okay. And then I guess also, could you remind me the magnitude of the year-to-date price increases across all three segments?", "Sean Hennessy", "Sure. We could do that Robert, in our stores group we've indicated that we took three separate pricing actions in January, in the slightly less than 5% range, again in May, in the slightly less than 5% range and again in the beginning of the third quarter, slightly less than 10%. The other segments of the company have also been out with the pricing in a range of similar volumes and we've taken those out once or twice depending on the product line and the environment we are selling in.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And year-to-date what percentage of that have you realized?", "Sean Hennessy", "We've been in the -- for the company we are at about the 50% range. What we've said is it takes us approximately 12 months to 18 months for the complete company to get the price back in to the market. Stores may be a little shorter than that, but when you put the whole companies together we're going to have that 50% to 55% right now.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "So you need about 4.5% pricing to offset the low end of the cost inflation range. And it sounds like you're at that run rate or close to it at this point. So as we look to '09, should we expect you to completely recover your price cost gap?", "Chris Connor", "We are at the run rate that we need to be at, given the guidance that we've provided. We would expect that, if you look at our margin performance historically through these cycles as Sean says, it tends to take us 12 months to 18 months to recover. As the severity of this cost increases gone in, we have not given guidance about how quickly we would return to our post recent peak in margins. And again, we'll be happy in the January timeframe to give you our expectations and margins for 2009 and how closely we can get back up.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And then, I guess lastly. Earlier in the year when you revised your guidance, you talked about raw material costs getting substantially ahead of you, they did catch up as the year progressed and to that end second quarter and third quarter performance was substantially better than the first quarter. Yet, the fourth quarter guidance implies the largest year-over-year decline in earnings that we've seen thus far in '08.", "And it sounds like the raws are coming in at towards the low-end of expectation, you are getting the pricing, what's changed, is it the volume absorption that you expect in the fourth quarter, are things getting worse from a volume perspective?", "Sean Hennessy", "I would tell you, first of -- is sales, in the third quarter for the company we're over 3%. What we are saying is we are going to be down slightly or up slightly. In the fourth quarter when you look at the SG&A is in a relatively fixed situation. So depending on the positive or negative sales situation, what you end up with is, your large percentage of your gross margin dollars actually flows to the bottom line. So, it's like being at a breakeven point. And so, with that sales projection and minus slightly or positive slightly, that's really the difference. We're at 3.3% in the third quarter, which allowed us to be relatively close to last year's EPS.", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. So it's absorption of a relatively fixed cost base", "Sean Hennessy", "", "Yes.", "", "Robert Felice - Gabelli & Company", "", "Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for taking my question.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you Rob", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "There's a lot in the press recently about liquidity issues for small businesses given the working capital needs of the paint business, do you think a lot of the small competitors as we go through the winter and they need to build the inventory into next [frame] are going to face any issues in terms of competitiveness of this strength?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, I would tell you that though when you look at a lot of the competitors that we have acquired, whether that was MAB, Duron and so forth, if you really look at the capital structure of any of these companies, number one, they have factories that were built in the 40's, 50's, 60's and are paid off. They own a large percentage of the real estate they are in. their cash needs, they don't have the cash needs of servicing debt and so forth. I think that they are going to have a squeeze, because they are going to have less positive cash flow from the business operation, but I don't think that their capital structure force them to be in a tough situation. It's a tough situation but it's not going to be a dire situation.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "It's not a critical fact.", "Bob Wells", "Yes.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "And then you are closing 80 stores this year, how widespread are foreclosings across the industry? Are there any anecdotal or industry-specific or industry-wide forecloses?", "Chris Connor", "I think that that's probably the high water mark from our competitors. I think we have seen more of a focus on not opening new stores and expanding than aggressive closings.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "That's it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of [Marisa Moss] with Banc of America Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Marisa Moss - Banc of America Securities", "Hi. Thanks for taking my call. I just have a couple of questions about liquidity. Can you provide us with your CP balance as of the end of the third quarter? Then it just seems like in the past you used to more evenly split your borrowings between the CP market and bank borrowings. So I'm just king of curious why you shifted to 80% to 90% borrowings on your bank lines?", "Sean Hennessy", "That 80% or 90% are revolver that we have with the Citi, not with the credit facility we have to back our commercial paper. We have not drawn on our credit facility and we do not have any plans on drawing on that facility. And it really comes down to price. The commercial paper market has really continued to drive up in price. Pricing of commercial paper has gone up. So we compare the one to the other, and that's the reason why the price on the revolver is less than commercial paper right now.", "As far as the balance I believe, today we have around $94 million in commercial paper balance.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Saul Ludwig. Please proceed with your question.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital", "Question on pricing, assuming you had no additional pricing in the first quarter, next year the cumulative affect of this year's pricing, what would be your realized year-over-year price improvement in the first quarter? Just based on what you've already done so far this year in both the stores group and the consumer group?", "Sean Hennessy", "We wouldn't comment on that specifically for the quarter, but the math is easy to do. We took slightly less than 5% in the first quarter in the stores. So you have to assume that it's already in there in the first quarter next year, but then we follow that up with a slightly less than 5% and slightly less than 9%.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital", "Sometime we have 4%, 4% and 8%, so that is 16%, and you get half of it, so would we think 8% increase would be about the minimum level to expect?", "Sean Hennessy", "You already had 4% of it in the first quarter from January 1 impact.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital", "Okay.", "Sean Hennessy", "So you have subsequent to that you had a 4% and a 8% so you have 12%.", "Chris Connor", "Correct. So that's the math.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital", "", "So we would be up 12% in the first quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "", "To the extent that we've got a 100% implementation, yes, but as we commented we don't have 100% of implementation of pricing even at conclusion.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital", "So you would have at least half, so you would have at least 6%.", "Sean Hennessy", "", "That could be in the right direction.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital", "Okay. Great. And same thing on the consumer?", "Sean Hennessy", "Correct.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Steve O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve O'Neill - Hilliard Lyons", "Thank you. I wondered if you could just elaborate bit on the lower environmental reserve?", "Bob Wells", "Every quarter when we take a look at the environmental expenses that is we have a full team that continues to work on environmental and really relating to some of the older locations that we have. We continue to do things that reduce our costs, and so we really are expensing less.It's not that we're reversing any accruals, the increase of our accruals did not happen this year because of controlling the total end cost of having these clean ups.", "Steve O'Neill - Hilliard Lyons", "Okay. And then as a follow-up to my earlier question. Could you elaborate just little bit on the nature of the manufacturing distribution facilities that you have closed?", "Bob Wells", "When you say elaborate, over the last few years we've brought in acquisitions of smaller paint companies in the United States. With that they've had plants and DFCs that in the long run did not fit our logistics model and we are going to get synergies from that. Some of them took a little longer. So, it was not handled in the purchase accounting and in this quarter we got to the point where we took a reserve, foreclosing of a warehouse and part of a logistics, so that's truly what they are.", "Steve O'Neill - Hilliard Lyons", "Even though those were regional paint companies, with operating paint stores those operations were still considered part of the consumer group?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, what we do is the Paint Stores Group is our marketing and sales organization. What we do is consolidate all of the manufacturing and logistics for the consumer customers as well as stores in to paint and coatings and consumer group. They have the responsibility and we find that, that gives us the most efficient model for manufacturing and logistics.", "Steve O'Neill - Hilliard Lyons", "Great. Thanks very much and a very good quarter.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you, Steve", "Operator", "Gentlemen, there are no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to hand it back over to you for some closing comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks again, Doug. Thank you all again for joining our call this morning, as always I will be available for the balance of the day and the week to answer any additional questions you might have.

(VAL) Q4 FY08 Earnings Call November 24, 2008 11:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Lori A. Walker - Sr. VP and CFO", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and CEO", "Analysts", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session instructions will be given at that time. [Operator instructions] And as a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to Lori Walker. Please go ahead.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning everyone, and welcome to our earnings conference call. Today we will be covering results for the fourth quarter and the full year. Bill Mansfield, our Chairman and CEO is with me on our call this morning.", "A couple of brief comments before we begin; first, I would direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning which contains much of the information that we'll be covering on the call. Also a quick reminder that this call is subject to the forward-looking statements language contained in our press release as our comments this morning may include forward-looking statements; as that term is defined by Security's Law.", "This morning, I'll cover our fourth quarter and full year results. Bill will make comments particularly about our 2009 outlook. Then we'll get to your questions.", "Results for the quarter were in line with our expectations reflecting a solid effort from Valspar employees in a challenging economic environment. As a reminder, our fourth quarter this year does include 14 weeks versus 13 weeks in 2007. This extra week only impacts our domestic business, which accounts for about 60% of total company revenue", "Fourth quarter sales totaled $923.2 million, an 8.3% increase from last year. Sales for the quarter increased 3.8% excluding the fourteenth week. Demand for our products in international markets remains strong driven by acquisitions and core growth in Asia. In coatings, we continue to see solid growth in our packaging and general industrial product line, and sales in our paint segment were quite strong. Net income for the fourth quarter was $38.9 million.", "Fourth quarter adjusted net income per share was $0.42, which excludes a $0.13 per share charge related to restructuring action, a non-cash of $0.03 per share for the Huarun minority interest share, and a $0.09 per share after tax gain from the sale of assets. Fourth quarter reported earnings per share for 2008 were $0.35.", "Net income for the fourth quarter of 2007 was $48.8 million. Fourth quarter adjusted net income per share in 2007 was $0.38 which excludes a $0.10 per share after tax gain from the sale of assets and a non-cash charge of $0.03 per share for Huarun minority interest shares.", "Fourth quarter reporting earnings per share in 2007 were $0.45. The underlying earnings per share comparison for the fourth quarter is $0.42 in 2008 and $0.38 in 2007, a 10.5% year-over-year increase and the extra week accounts for about $0.01 to $0.02 per share.", "On a full year basis, again adjusting for restructuring one time gain and Huarun, the underlying earnings per share comparison is $1.57 in fiscal 2008 and $1.58 in fiscal 2007. For the fourth quarter our reported gross margin was 26.9% or 28.3% after excluding the impact of our restructuring actions, down 70 basis points from 29% in the fourth quarter of 2007. The 70 basis point decline was due to higher raw material cost which were partially offset by pricing.", "Operating expenses were 18.7% of sale or 19.6% excluding restructuring and the gain from the sale of assets, down 50 basis points from 20.1% in the fourth quarter of 2007. The 50 basis point decline was driven by good control of expenses. The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.7% down from 36% in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year our tax rate was 34.1% compared with 33.7% in 2007.", "For fiscal 2009 we expect the effective tax rate on income from ongoing operations to be approximately 33.5 to 34%. Average shares outstanding were down $1.5 million from a year ago with the decline related to the share repurchases that we completed in the first half of fiscal 2008. We did not purchase any additional shares during the fourth quarter. Average sales outstanding were $100.4 million for the quarter and are projected to be approximately the same for the first quarter of 2009. As a reminder, we repurchased $1.85 million shares in 2008.", "Recapping our sales performance for the quarter, our core growth defined as volume price mix was up 4%, currency added 2.3% and acquisitions added another 2% for total growth of 8.3% in the quarter. Without the extra week, price volume mix was essentially flat, reflecting an increase in price, which offset a decline in volume.", "Turning to our segment results for the quarter, coating sales increased 8.6% and were up lower single-digit when adjusted for currency and acquisitions. We had solid performance in our packaging and general industrial product lines with packaging in particular continuing to show excellent strength. Soft sales in wood coatings continued.", "Paints sales increased 11.6% and were up high single digit when adjusted for currency and acquisition, driven primarily by strong performance of our Huarun operations and price increases. Sales in our other category which includes resins, colorants, gel coats, and our furniture repair business were down 5.1% reflecting weak market conditions.", "Looking at segment results for the full year, coating segment sales were up 10.9% and up low single digit when adjusted for currency and acquisition. Again, our best sales performance came from packaging and coating, which was up net double-digit for the year and up high single digit when adjusted for currency.", "Paint segment sales increased 3.5% and were up low single digit when adjusted for currency and acquisition. Our other category was down 2.3% for the year and down mid single digit when adjusted for currency. Addressing margins for the quarter by segment, and I will talk about these results excluding restructuring charges. Our coating segment EBIT margin was 10.9%, down from 11.8% in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Our Paint segment EBIT margin was 9.3%, up from 7.4% in 2007. The EBIT margin for our other category, excluding restructuring and the one time gains in both '07 and in '08 was negative 10.7% compared with negative 6% in the fourth quarter last year. As a reminder, our other category includes corporate expenses. Total company event margin for the quarter with 8.6%, this compares with our 2007 fourth quarter margin of 8.7%.", "Looking at margins with a full year again excluding restructuring charges, our coating's EBIT margin was 9.8% down from 10.7% in the 2007. The paint's segment EBIT margin for the year was 9% compared to 9.7% last year. The EBIT margin for our other category, excluding restructuring and one time gain was negative 2.4% compared with positive 0.03% in 2007.", "Total company full year EBIT margin was 8.5%. This compares with our fiscal 2007 margins of 9.4%. The 90 basis point decline in comparable year-over-year margin is primarily a reflection of a lag between raw material cost increases and the impact from pricing actions.", "Moving to the balance sheet, total debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $923 million down $162 million from $1.85 billion at the end of the third quarter and down $94 million from the end of last fiscal year. The decrease in our debt was driven primarily by improved free cash flow and proceeds from divestitures offset by acquisitions and share repurchases.", "We estimate that year end debt for fiscal 2009 will be approximately $825 million assuming no acquisitions or share repurchases. This implies free cash flow after dividend of approximately $100 million. Our year end debt to capital ratio was 38.8%, a 340 basis point improvement from last year's level of 42.2%. Net debt to cap for the year was 36.4%, a 390 basis point improvement from 40.3% at the end of 2007.", "Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $16.6 million down from $29.2 million in last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, capital spending was $43 million versus $76.9 million in 2007. Our forecast for 2009 capital spending is approximately $60 million depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $21.9 million versus $20.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Our full year depreciation and amortization was $80.8 million versus $71.8 million last year. Our forecast for depreciation and amortization in 2009 is $80 million.", "Let me give a few more details on the restructuring actions that we announced in August. The total cost of the overall effort are expected to be $0.23 to $0.25 per share with a two year payback. Of the total restructuring cost, about 65% is cash and 39... or 35% is non-cash.", "In fiscal 2008, we took a $0.16 per share charge; the remaining $0.07 to $0.09 per share charge will primarily occur in the first half of fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2010, these actions are expected to generate annual savings of $0.13 to $0.15 per share. Given the level of uncertainty in credit markets, I know you will like to hear a few details about our capital structure, debt maturity and liquidity position.", "We have a $200 million bond that matures in May 2012 and two additional bond issuances totaling $300 million that mature in August 2015 and May 2017. We have a $150 million committed credit facility that has been extended through November 2009 and a $600 million five year committed credit facility that expire in October 2010. Our liquidity at October 31st stood at $430 million with approximately $90 million in cash and $340 million available through our committed bank credit facility. As I mentioned earlier, we are expecting to use our free cash flow to reduce debt by approximately $100 million by the end of 2009.", "As mentioned in our release, we currently expect our fiscal 2009 adjusted net income per share to be in the range $1.55 to a $1.65, excluding restructuring charges and a non-cash charge for Huarun minority interest shares. With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for his comments and more about the outlook for 2009.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Lori and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining our call today. As Lori mentioned, results for the fourth quarter were inline with our guidance. Our global packaging architectural and general industrial product lines and our Huarun business in China all performed well.", "Our expenses continue under tight control and we reported a 10.5% increase in our adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter. Our management team and employees did a great job of focusing on execution and operational discipline, and made good progress on pricing, on lowering our cost, on improving our productivity and on generating cash.", "In addition, our Valspar, Cabot and Huarun brands were strengthened significantly as a result of our ongoing strategic investments. With respect to the restructuring we announced in August, it is certainly the right action given economic conditions, and we have taken steps beyond those we originally announced. Our actions impact all our geographic regions and touch most of our businesses.", "About half of the total cost is related to optimizing our European operations where we have closed satellite operations, consolidated warehousing and streamlined our administrative processes. In North America, we closed four manufacturing plants. And we continue to reduce the cost structure of our global wood business which incidentally delivered a modest profit in 2008.", "Our global head count is down about 7% since January of 2008 and we expect it to be down about 10% when we complete our restructuring actions; very difficult decisions but necessary actions in the current economic environment. We will continue to tightly manage our employment levels and expenses.", "I want to make some comments on the dynamics around raw materials and raw material cost. Raw materials represent $0.60 of very dollar of sales. In 2008, our raw material cost continued to increase through October, the last month of our fiscal year. We told you on our last call that our raw material cost would increase 9% to 14% and in the quarter we were at the high end of that range. Raw material cost increases, combined with the expected lag in increasing our selling prices, caused our margins to decline in 2008.", "We've continue to increase prices but the dynamics are now changing and changing quickly. We expect the raw material cost to decline and we're committed to restoring our margins during 2009.", "During the year, we generated a $160 million in free cash flow which we define as operating cash less CapEx and dividends, an increase of a $100 million from 2007 and we reduced our debt by $94 million.", "As Lori reviewed we have committed bank credit facilities and reserve liquidity well in excess of our anticipated funding needs.", "In 2008 we reduced our working capital, which we define as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable. And improved our working capital ratio by 160 basis points to 12.5% of sales, which we believe puts us among the leaders in the coatings industry.", "We have continued to invest in the Valspar, Cabot and Huarun brands. We and our customers have seen tangible benefits from that investment in 2008. In United States we have seen consistent gains in consumer awareness and we believe the Valspar and Cabot brands outperform the market. In China our Huarun brand continues to experience significant growth, and in 2009 we will continue to invest and add to the growing strength of our brands.", "Looking ahead to 2009, we believe we are in a global recession. In this environment, we expect our packaging, architectural and automotive refinished product lines and our Huarun business in China which comprise about 60% of the company to continue to perform well. Our global packaging business which supplies the food and beverage industry has been a steady performer over numerous business cycles.", "Our Huarun business in China is focused on the Chinese domestic market. Our automotive refinished product line is focused exclusively on the repair market with no OEM business. In our architectural business, our branding investments will allow us to continue to outperform the market. Our coil and general industrial and wood product lines which comprise the remaining 40% of the company will face top-line challenges during 2009 and that expectation is built into our '09 guidance.", "Want to take a few moments to make sure everyone understands the assumptions that have gone into our guidance. We believe we are in a global recession, we have assumed a partial reversal of the raw material cost increases we experienced in 2008, we expect our coil, general industrial and wood product lines which comprise about 40% of the company to face top-line pressure.", "Our guidance does include expected savings from our restructuring actions and we expect our packaging, architectural, automotive refinish product lines and our Huarun business in China which comprise about 60% of the company to continue to perform well.", "I believe that Valspar is well positioned to deal with the impact of a global recession. We have a balanced business mix and expect about 60% of our business to continue to perform. We have lowered our overall cost structure and reduced capacity to match weaker demand. It is reasonable to expect to see some easing in raw material cost. We are controlling expenses, working capital and employment levels. We have committed bank credit facilities and reserve liquidity well in excess of our anticipated funding needs. We have strong brands and differentiated market positions that we have made stronger with our investments in the global markets over the last three years. And we will continue to deliver strong consistent cash flow.", "With those comments, I'll open the call up for your questions.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "A couple of things. The overhead expenses you had in the quarter were roughly 188 versus 172 in a year ago period, were up 5%. Why were they up so much in the quarter?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Frankly, I don't have an answer to your question, Jeff. Why don't you give us a second and go on with the rest of the questions and we'll see if we can sort that out.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Second, raw materials are obviously coming down at a pretty rapid rate and through the year you've been increasing prices. How do you expect the dynamic to play out between you and your customer base in terms of the split of who benefits from raw material? And what are the operative dynamics there? Could you here that?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, are you there.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Yes, I am now.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, I don't know what happened. Sorry about that.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "No it's all right.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "We were talking about raw material cost coming down and pricing and how that dynamic will play out in 2009.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Yes.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "As I mentioned in my opening comments, we are committed to restoring our margins during 2009. As the cost went up, our pricing lagged and our margins went down in '08. So first order of business is we need to restore our margins and second order of business we'll be the right thing for our shareholders and our customers if the material markets continue to decline during 2009.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "So when you talk to your major customers, what did they say about that? Did they say yes your margins have lagged on the way up and so we are going give you a certain amount of grace and then after that we'll see where raw materials go or is it more contentious than that?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I would tell you that through the end of October, I mentioned our costs were continuing to go up. The dynamic, the inflection point with respect to the material markets has just occurred over the last three or four weeks. And frankly the benefit as to what that benefit may be, is still unclear as we move forward. So I think it's premature for me to comment on any discussions that involve our customers.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Yes, I guess lastly, have you noticed any change in business conditions since your quarter ended? Or in general has there been a continuity in your business conditions with what happened in the quarter?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "We saw a downturn quiet frankly in the second half of September; like a lot of people did. And that weakness continued in October and it continues still. And it really reflects my comments with respect to 60% of the company is continuing to perform well, the other 40%, as I mentioned, is certainly seeing and experiencing the effects of what we think is a global recession. Now back to your first question. Lori will provide an answer to that.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.Jeff, just in terms of that comment, our expenses grew at 6.5% versus the sales growth of 8.3%. So we actually did have lower expense growth and sales growth. But we did have a couple of headwinds there; one was the fact in terms incentive comp, so our incentive comp went a little bit higher this year than last year. So it was headwinds there and the other piece of it is that we also looked at our bad debt and we did have two of our bad debt reserves which added a probably couple of cents.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of P. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup", "Yes, hi, good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, P.J.", "Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup", "Bill, I was wondering if you could comment on China and what you are seeing there through Huarun and have seen any slow down there at all?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I'd be happy to. Our business in China consists of the Huarun business and then what we call the historic Valspar business. That is furniture coatings and industrial coatings. Our business in China, the historic Valspar business that is related to the export economy clearly has softened; that meaning exports out of China back to the US or Western Europe.", "However our Huarun business that is focused on the domestic Chinese economy, the domestic Chinese consumers is doing quite well. And as we look forward, we would expect that they will continue to do well.", "Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup", "And secondly in the US, have you seen that the paint volume declines have slowed down? And what I'm trying to get at is, if in 2008 industry paint volumes decline maybe let's say high single digits. What are your expectations for '09?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I think that the 8% to 10% is a number that has been used to describe the downturn in the consumer or architectural things market. The DIY and professional markets that ... and we would agree with that comment for 2008. I can tell you that our business has been quiet good on a relative basis in '08.", "We think we've outperformed the market. Our business has been stable with respect to softness that we saw at the end of '07 and the beginning of '08 and so as we looked forward in 2009, we expect a continuation of our architectural, paint performance. I think where we're going to see pressure PJ is in the businesses that I described in my opening comments in our coil, general industrial and frankly the wood coating's business.", "Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup", "And you think your business held up better than the industry, because it focuses on DIY?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I think there is, I can't quantitatively give you the numbers that would support that conclusion, but I believe it has held up better because of its DIY focus and also ... and I can't emphasize this enough because of the investments in the Valspar and Cabot brands in the US.", "Prashant Juvekar - Citigroup", "Alright, thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome P. J.", "Operator", "Thank you our next question is from the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you, good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning David.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Bill in your packaging business, do prices tend to hold there little bit longer than they do in either industrial or your architectural business?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I guess, I suppose I could take it exception to the question in the way it was framed in that, do they hold a little bit longer; I think as we have described in past calls, this is not the first time the company or the coatings market has faced the dynamic of accelerating raw material cost followed by a period of weakness. In fact this is the, I believe the third time where we've seen a tremendous run up in material cost followed by a major recession. And I would tell you that the dynamic that applied in prior experiences has been that our prices have been relatively sticky. And I don't see any reason why wouldn't be the case this time.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "That's very helpful. And Bill just in your coil, wood and GI business, any share shifts of note this year or lately?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Coil, packaging and general industrial, yes we continue to take share in '08 as we have done in past years. I wouldn't say that it's notably different from the performance we've turned in over a number of years in that business. Otherwise things ... as normal.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "And, then Bill on your brand building expense, what was it in '08 and will it be down in '09?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "We had communicated prior that it would be done in '08, in fact it was. I think the number was approximately $10 million and on an absolute dollar basis. Going into '09, prior we had also communicated that it would go down again. But on a going forward basis David, I ... quite candidly, I'm not going to comment any more on the delta declines, I think we have passed the point at which there's material to understanding the company.", "We will continue to make the right investments in our brands and I think we've made the investment case and so I don't feel the need. When you think about it we're a $3.5 billion company to talk about $5 million and $10 million changes like ... I think on a go forward basis we're not going to comment anymore. But I will tell you that consistent with my prior comments that the brand spin will be down in absolute dollars in, again in 2009.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Understood, thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you David.", "Operator", "Thank you our next question is through line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Ingalls & Snyder. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Good morning all.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Bill could you talk about what you have in mind in terms of CapEx for 2009. I mean it was $60 million you are saying versus for the $43 million this year in recession, global recession year, what are you focusing on can you give us a better feel or what did you eliminate in '08 that you are now going to pickup in '09?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well $43 million that we spent in '08 was a number that we exercised a lot of control around and there is probably some money that we would have spent in '08 that's carrying over into '09 number one.", "Number two, there is some capital, modest amount of capital that we are spending as a result of our restructuring actions, that will occur in '09 and then we have a what I would tell you is a normal capital spending of productivity in progress in our facility, safety, health and environmental expense around the globe.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "What is more or less Bill, the maintenance CapEx?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I would say maintenance CapEx is in the ... it's not 50% of the $60 million. The other dynamic Rosemarie is, in years past there have been times where we spent as much as $18 million and in those years we were building new plants. And so you had a significant piece of capital associated with the construction of the new facility and certainly in 2009 we don't intent to build any new facilities.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "You ... thanks that is helpful.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "You said that you are going to do some more restructuring versus what you initially announced. Could you give us a feel for what you are planning in doing?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes that is associated with expenses, selling, general administrative expenses, associated with our general industrial and coil businesses primarily and a little bit in continuing in our wood business.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And Rosemarie just as a reminder, in the third quarter we had set the total cost to be $0.21 to $0.23 with, in essence since in the year of the $0.13 to $0.15 is what we would incur in fiscal 2008, and we actually incurred $0.16 because we've already taken those actions.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Okay. And there's additional restructuring charges gain on sale of assets Lori, where are they in the fourth quarter, meaning Huarun is separate, but the other two how do you split them between cost of goods and SG&A?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. For 2008 the gain on the sale of the asset is in the operating expense line, the entire gain. And last year the gain on sale of the intellectual property is sitting in the other.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "And the restructuring is all sitting in cost of goods?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No the restructuring is spilt between cost of goods and expenses and it's roughly 65% as in cost of goods sold.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "And if I can go back to the ... they're [ph] my last question and you have already heard it but, I'll try another tack, on pricing versus raw material cost. Usually, it takes about 6 to 12 months to catch up in pricing versus raw material cost on the way up. Can we anticipate that it is similar on the way down or do you think that given the current environment and the low demand for some of your products and so on, it may go down a little faster than it went up?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I can answer the question. We are sitting at an inflection point today. Really for the past 45 days or so, where our material markets have gotten weak and its quite clear we are in a global recession. The dynamics and I realized that folks would like a better answer. But the dynamics still have to play out. We are in un-chartered territory in my opinion with respect to length and depth of a recession.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Ingalls & Snyder Llc", "Okay. Thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from line Saul Ludwig from Keybanc. Please go ahead.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Hi. Good morning everybody.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Saul.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "In your guidance for next year, there is a lot moving parts and we understand that the difficultly in being precise. But what have you baked in for raw material cost changes? You'd probably be wrong but you had to have a starting point?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "And that's probably why won't answer the question, because I probably be wrong. Saul it's ... I think the interplay that we have here are, is the perceived weakness in the raw material cost and what's also going to be top line challenges in about 40% of the company.", "And we think our guidance is appropriate. We think our guidance reflects the dynamics of the global market today and as you pointed out in your initial comments, very difficult to be quantitatively precise.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "And Lori what were the pretax announced for the gains and restructuring numbers?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The gain was roughly $14 million Saul and restructuring is round ... this is in the quarter around $19.5.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay and then in your guidance Bill where you are basically saying we think we're going to have a relatively flat year in earnings for '09 versus '08. Do you think that's going to play out fairly equally as we go through the four quarters or do you see a more challenging first half with a little better second half, how do you sort of see the year in a general way unfolding?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That's a fair question. I think we're going to have more downside pressure in the first half of the year, with the expectation that the second half of the year will start to see some improvement.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "And do you think the second half improvement is due to a little bit of hope that your policies across the economy to start to improve or is it a function of easy comps or what is it that makes you think the second half is going to be better than the first half, is it the raw materials ... I mean what's the thinking?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well I don't know hold any hope out for what the government does Saul. I think that as was described earlier, there is a lag between this inflection point and this material cost moved down. So I think we'll see a little more favorable second half scenario with respect to material cost than we will see in the first half.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That's primarily.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay, hey Lori what was the FX component to the revenues in the fourth quarter?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The fourth quarter was 2.3% in the fourth quarter.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "2.3% out of the 3.8% growth.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Wait, the 3.8% didn't count for 14th week?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The 3.8% does not count the 14th week.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay. So that means, so extra fourteenth week price mix ... price volume mix was 1.5%?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, it's doubly negative 0.5%.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Didn't you say you're sales were up ... oh, yes you have the acquisition in there too?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, so 0.5%, negative 0.5% will be price volume mix about the extra week.", "Saul Ludwig - Keybanc Capital Markets", "Next fourteenth week, got it. Okay, thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Saul.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Don Carson from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Yes, just wanted to follow up on the FX. What you've given a bit of the revenue impact but as you look at the whole year, what do you think the contribution to earnings was from the weak dollar and what is your guidance to assume in terms of how much that reverses is in 2009?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "In both cases Don, probably $0.02 to $0.03 benefit '08 reversing two to three in '09 and that impact is included in our guidance.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, so pretty to minimize. Though what did you see your customers' doing in terms, I know there is not lot of inventory in the paint system but did you see your customers deliberately drawing down inventories, so that give some hope but at some point there is bit of snapback thinking specifically about your big box customers and moves they're taking to reduce working capital?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, if you're talking about our architectural paint business those inventories in our opinion are in very good shape, and they have been all year. I think we have to remember that the housing related part of the ... of our business has been in a recession floor well onto two years now. And so people are controlled and are managing their inventories in our opinion very, very well. So certainly, we don't expect anything there.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "And that gives the broader issue again, your positive outlook in architectural is just more of the few, you've kind of reached bottom here and it can't get much worse, although perhaps we shouldn't say that, but it's just the easy comps that they give you confidence that it's not going to get worse?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I look at our fourth quarter performance in the paint segment, and we look at our performance relative to the market, the brands; that investment clearly is paying off in terms of our performance. And we see a continuation of that performance in '09.", "Donald Carson - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "And you are welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question is from line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research, please go ahead.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Thanks for taking my questions. Couple of them have already been answered; but I just want to ... got to clarify. You talked about not doing any share repurchases in the fourth quarter.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Of this year. Can you give us kind of your outlook for your share repurchase strategy heading into 2009 given that you were just recently up to your authorization and the stock certainly seems to be priced attractively?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Well Dmitry we ... yes we did. We renewed the authorization, but we have that authorization every year. And there have been some years where we have bought close to the authorization, there have been some years where we have bought very little. I think I would draw your attention to the comment that Lori made relative to cash in 2009 and our debt forecast in terms of going from roughly 925 to 825 and I think that would give you a some insight into our cash, cash use priorities.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, so at this point you think that it's more impactful to draw down debts to perhaps position yourself for some acquisitions when market conditions begin to recover rather than repurchasing your shares?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That is correct.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay excellent. Second question, you've turned in a quite a good performance in architectural, I think even if you exclude the extra week you are probably still up in the organic growth. Can you talk about the drivers there, you talked about your brands being strong, and the market no performing, perhaps competition in gaining some market share especially for Cabot. But is there anything more beyond that, is there anything going on in the automotive after market business or perhaps some of your smaller businesses that are doing particularly well or is it just overall strength?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no its overall strength. As you well know, Lowes is our primary customer in the big box channel. We think we have a great strategic partnership with Lowes and certainly the Valspar brand has gone very well. In our dealer business our independent retailer business, again it's a story of the Valspar brand and our mass merchant business, was okay this year. So I think what you are seeing in that segment really reflects strength across our architectural business, which I have to remind you does also include, our Chinese Huarun branded consumer papers which of all of them has performed the best year-over-year, 2008 versus 2007.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, okay, that's helpful. And then that actually brings me to my next question, in discussing acquisitions in the 2% of the impact from acquisitions in the quarter. Was there any Huarun left at that or is that totally an anniversary to mutual stock and about the Mexican and the Finnish acquisitions you made this year?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That will anniversary in the first quarter of '09.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "So it's primarily ... it's just the Aries acquisition in Mexico.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes just the Mexico.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay so it's just the Mexican acquisition?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. So we should expect the acquisition component and how should we think about that with Huarun anniversaring in the first quarter of next year and the Finnish deal that you've done later in the year. Should we be thinking about kind of that 1.5% to 2% positive impact continuing in '09?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No Dimitry, we should not. The only anniversary that's going to occur is the Aries acquisition in January.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. All the other ones have been anniversaried?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct. They have.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Correct.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. Very good, and then final question, you mentioned in your comments that packaging was doing well and you also mentioned general industrial business was continuing to do well. And then later on I think it was an answer to Jeff's question you talked about that business slowing down in the second half of September and October.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "As you are looking into 2009 have you seen incremental weakness in the general industrial business or is that part of your franchise still doing well?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I would tell from probably late September, the month of October the business started to get little softer and certainly we see that in November.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. So then if you look at your kind of 60% of the business that did well in '08 versus 40 that didn't, would you say that going into '09 this is going to more like a 50-50 with some weakening in general industrial?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no it's still 60-40.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Still 60-40.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "So in general industrial was ... is in the 48% or in the 60%?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct, it's in the 48%.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. All right, thank you very much. That's all I have. Thank you", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Dmitry.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks, Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Bob.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Bob.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Well, I've to say, I'm impressed you're able to give an '09 guidance number given, so many moving parts.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Bob.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "I think you said ... I'll put words in your mouth and then you correct me if I'm wrong, but ... that you deserve the right to restore your margins. In terms of how you price your products going into next year and how much of this raw material relief you actually get to harvest on the bottom-line.", "So assuming that's true, restore means what, does that mean go back to sort of the low 30s where you have been in prior periods of weaker raw materials or does it mean more around the 30% gross margin range where you sort of averaged over the last decade. How much worth of room [ph] is there in terms of getting margins back to where you think is a acceptable level", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No. Well certainly back 2004, they're about low 30s is the right target I think. I don't think we have a right to restore margins. I was actually too strong, so I will have to change the words you put into my mouth. I think that that is our intent. For us to be a viable supplier that continues to invest in technologies, continues to invest in branding. We have to have the ability to attract capital, and our shareholders are entitled to a reasonable return. And that's all we are saying.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. And then you mentioned Huarun is ... I think you characterized, it is continuing to be strong.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "But I guess what I read in the press reports that the Chinese real estate is not all that encouraging. Could you give me a little bit more flavor on what gives you confidence going into the next year and is that to sustain where you are today or to keep growing at the rates you've seen?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "We're, and with respect to our business model, Huarun business model, we continue to penetrate and move out into cities where we have not had a major presence. And this is what gives us confidence in 2009, although the Chinese economy on an overall basis may not grow double-digits who knows, may grow less than that. As we increase our penetration in the market, in the country, we are able to sustain our growth model. So we are quite confident in 2009 with respect to that.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Terrific, thanks.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steve Schwartz from First Analysis. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Hi, good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Elco announced that they were going to shutter one of their can sheet facilities some ... I'm wondering with your strength and packaging is it because you're gaining share, and is your core business shrinking or is your core business itself still strong?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I think what you're probably getting at is there, there was softness reported in the beverage market in both Western Europe and in United States, here in the late summer ... I guess really through the summer and in the fall. Unclear exactly what that's about but it's reasonable to think that there is probably some consumer reaction to increase prices; there has been increased prices across the whole food and beverage sector. And there might be some reactions to that.", "What we are hear, what our customers tell us is that this is a dynamic, it will start to correct itself when we get into the turn of the year. That there is some inventory corrections going on but we should move beyond that as we get into early '09.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Okay. So have been able to continue to see growth in that business then because you are picking up some share?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Okay. And then do you have a rough breakout of the 14th week, how it benefited the segments? I know Lori; you mentioned that it was exclusively domestic business? But of that it looks like $38 million. How much of that fell into paying?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "You're talking sales to sales dollars?", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Yes.", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Lets see ... I don't have it really quick the top of my head here to...", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Can we get back to you?", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Oh yes. Just to echo an observation Dmitry made, your paint sales were very strong.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Considering the environment, would you feel comfortable saying that your volumes were actually up at your national accounts primarily the one?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I think we have to remember a significant thing that occurred in the market place and that was paint prices at retail, across the DIY channel increased in late July, early August.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Okay. So good percentage of that then was price.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "That would be a good assumption.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Corp", "Okay great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You are quite welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Hamilton from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "Good morning.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning Mike.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "So just technical question first on the Huarun non-cash charge both in text and in comment you used it as a charge, is that something different from the normal mechanism we have seen in the last couple of years or referenced to the same thing?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's referenced to the same thing Mike.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, thanks. You've ... starting with paint you've done some successful sales this year. You're beginning to flex muscle in terms of how well you are taking advantage of brand? Do you see an environment in here where taking share accelerates or would you kind of put it on a par with what we have been seeing?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "No I would tell you that we are taking a long view on our brand investment and we are quite pleased with the '08 performance. We would expect to turn in another good '09 performance and I think we see a steady, sustained increase in the brand equity of the Valspar brand, and Calbot brand and Huarun brand.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. My other question as you look forward on potential to be able to take advantage of the environment for both time acquisitions, are there any areas either geographically or technically that you particularly want to be focusing on here?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I think I need to get some clear transparency into what may be the longer term economic fundamentals. We still like Latin America. It's been a great area for us and so certainly from a geographic basis, and China is still a highly attractive market for on a geographical basis. The architectural business, our consumer paint business we're always looking in that area.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks, that is it for me.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. And we have a follow up from the line of Jeff Zekauskas from J.P. Morgan. Please, go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Thanks for taking my question.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "How much were prices up sequentially for the company on average?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Lower single digit.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, low single digit, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, 2% or 3 %. Including the extra week, was your gallon interrupt [ph] in the quarter?", "Lori A. Walker - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Including the extra week was our...?", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Gallon interrupt [ph].", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, probably, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, close but maybe not quite spot on.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And you know there is a lot of talk about how fast your raw materials affect your cost of goods sold but then don't you turn your inventories twice a quarter, so shouldn't it be pretty quick?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "To the extent that the drops in propylene and ethylene neither of which we buy, we buy derivatives to extent that those derivative prices come down, it should come through pretty quick, that is correct?", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay and then lastly, just if you could just quickly compare sort of business conditions in Europe versus business conditions in the United States, sort of which market is stronger, which market is weaker, or are they both the same? How you see that?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I think as we've said before, our bigger business in Europe is can coatings and so the US, European can coatings market is about the same. I'm probably not a good one to comment on the overall European industrial market. But my sense is it might be a tad weaker than the U.S.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Right.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "From what we see.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Alright. And how about the U.S. architectural market, can you make some general comments about how strong or how weak that is, forgetting your business for a moment?", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Other than, we see reported, we happen to think it's probably correct that the market for the second year in a row has declined. In that, I guess 7% to 9%, somewhere around there we concur with that. Have we hit bottom from a market basis, I don't know. Certainly our business stabilized a while ago and is frankly doing well in this environment.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, thanks. Thank you very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Yes.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "I figured out what happened on your first question, somehow I hit the mute button. So that caused all sorts of problem, so I apologize.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "No, it's no trouble. Thank you, very much.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And due to the time, we will turn it back for closing comments.", "William L. Mansfield - Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you everyone for joining our call. We believe we had a good fourth quarter and a good ending to our fiscal 2008 year. We believe we're well positioned to deal with the impact of a global recession. We have reserve liquidity well in excess of our funding needs and as you heard us say several times, we will generate roughly $100 million of free cash during '09.", "Again thank you for participating in today's call, we wish everyone a happy and peaceful Thanksgiving and we'll talk to you in February, when we have our first quarter '09 earnings call.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Jackie.  In order to allow more time for questions, we have provided balance sheet items and over statistical data on our website sherwin.com under Investor Relations 2008 Year-End Press Release.", "Summarizing overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2008, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter declined 8.3% to $1.7 billion due to sales volume declines resulting from worsening economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad.  For the full year, sales declined $25 million or three-tenths of a percent to $7.98 billion.", "Acquisitions completed during the year increased consolidated net sales seven-tenths of a percent in the quarter.  Businesses acquired during 2007 and 2008 added 1.9% in consolidated net sales in the year.", "Unfavorable currency translation rates decreased consolidated net sales 2.8% in the quarter.  For the year, favorable currency translation rates increased sales four-tenths of a percent.", "Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 46.2% of sales from 44.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the year, gross margin declined to 43.8% compared to 45% in 2007.  Selling general and administrative expenses in dollars decreased $8.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, but increased at a percent of sales to 37.3% from 34.6% in the same quarter last year.", "For the full year 2008, SGNA expense increased to 33.1% of sales from 32.4% in 2007.  Tight expensive management across all operating positions could not fully offset an increase in SGNA from acquisitions and the effect of a slowdown in sales growth on SGNA percentage for the quarter and year.", "In the fourth quarter of 2008 the company took a trademark and goodwill impairment charges totaling $30.7 million or $0.18 per share.  The reflect reduction in sales and cash flow across certain acquired trademarks and businesses.  During the year, the company took trademark and goodwill impairment charges totaling $0.31 per share.", "As a reminder, the company took an impairment charge of $16.1 million or approximately $0.08 per share in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Interest expense for the quarter decreased by $4.5 million to $14.7 million due to a reduction in short term interest rates.  Interest and net investment income was roughly flat in the quarter at $1.6 million.  For the year, interest expense decreased $5.9 million due to lower short-term borrowing rates and lower average borrowings.  Interest and net investment income decreased $10.5 million in the year due to lower overall rates and lower average investments compared to 2007.", "Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2008 increased to 36.6% from 33.7% in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the year, our effective tax rate was 33.2% compared to 32.6% in 2007.", "Consolidated net income for the quarter decreased by $50.6 million or 50.2%, to $50.2 million from $100.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the year, net income decreased $138.7 million or 22.5%.  Net income as a percent of sales decreased to 3% in the fourth quarter this year from 5.4% in the fourth quarter last year.  This decrease was due primarily for the year-over-year SGNA expense increase as a percent of sales, the higher impairment charges, and the increase in our fourth quarter income tax rate.", "For the year, net income as a percent of sales decreased to 6% in 2008, from 7.7% in 2007.  The decrease was a result of lower growth margin, higher SGNA as a percent of sales, and higher impairment charges taken during the year.", "Diluted net income for common share for the fourth quarter 2008 was $0.42 per share, including an $0.18 per share impairment charge, compared to $0.80 per share in fourth quarter 2007, which again included an $0.08 per share impairment charge.", "For the year, diluted net income per common share decreased 14.9% to $4 per share from $4.70 per share in 2007.", "I would now like to review our performance by segment.  Sales for our paint stores group in fourth quarter 2008 decreased 8.8% to $1.04 billion.  For the year, net sales decreased 2.4% to $4.83 billion. For the quarter and year, decreased paint volume sales across most customer segments were partially offset by selling price increases.", "The acquisitions of (inaudible) and Columbia Paint completed during 2007 had no effect on sales in the fourth quarter and increased net sales for the group, 1.8% in the year.  Comparable stores sales decreased 10% in the quarter and 5.3% in the year.", "Regionally in the fourth quarter, our southwest division led all divisions, followed by our eastern division, Midwestern division, and southeastern division. Sales by all four paint stores divisions declined in the fourth quarter and full year.", "Segment operating profits for the paint stores group decreased 28.2% to $113.2 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 15.5% to $647.9 million for the year.  Acquisitions completed during 2007 had no effect on segment profits for the quarter, and reduced segment profit by six-tenths of a percent for the year.", "Segment operating profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased to 10.9% from 13.8% last year.  Profit margin for the full year 2008 decreased to 13.4% from 15.5% in 2007.  The reduction in profit margin for the quarter and the year was due primarily to the impairment charges.", "Turning now to the consumer group; external net sales in the consumer group decreased $18.7 million or 7.1% to $245.6 million in the fourth quarter and decreased $39.6 million or 3% to $1.27 billion for the year compared to the same period last year.  The sales declines were due primarily to sluggish, do-it-yourself demand at most of the group\u2019s retail customers.", "Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter, including an asset impairment charge of $8.2 million decreased $9 million or 42.4% to $12.3 million.  Segment operating profit for the year, including an asset impairment charge of $11 million dropped $83.9 million or 37.4% to $140.2 million.  As a percent of net sales, consumer groups\u2019 operating profit decreased to 5% for the quarter from 8.1% last year, and decreased to 11% from the year from 17.1% in \u201907.", "For our global finishes group, net sales in the fourth quarter decreased 7.9% to $414.4 million as a result of unfavorable currency translations and deteriorating market demand. Sales for the year increased 7.8% to $1.87 billion.", "Acquisitions increased the group\u2019s sales in U.S. dollars by 2.6% in the quarter and 3.3% in the year.  Sales in local currency before acquisitions decreased by eight-tenths of a percent in the quarter and grew by 2.9% in the year due primarily to volume growth.  Global finishes group segment operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased $12.6 million or 44.5% to $15.8 million.", "Segment operating profit for the full year decreased $8.5 million or 5.3% to 152.2 million.  State and local currency segment profit decreased 29% and 8.2% for the fourth quarter and year respectively.", "Global finishes group profit for the quarter and the year were negatively impacted by increased raw material costs that could not be fully offset by higher sales volume, selling price increases, and volume related manufacturing deficiencies.  As a percent of net sales, global finishes group operating profit decreased to 3.8% for the quarter from 6.3% last year and decreased to 8.2% for the year from 9.3% in 2007.", "I would now like to comment briefly on our balance sheet items.  You will find more balance sheet information on our website under sherwin.com Investor Relations Press Releases.", "Our total debt on December 31st, 2008 was $833.7 million, including short-term borrowings of $516.4 million.  Total debt as a percent of total capitalization decreased to 34.2% in 2008 from 35.1% at the end of 2007.  Our cash balance at year end 2008 was $26.2 million compared to $27.3 million in 2007.", "Capital expenditures were $25.4 million in the fourth quarter and $117.2 million for the year compared to $165.9 million for the year 2007.  Depreciation expense was $35.9 million in the quarter and $143.2 million for the year.  And amortization expense was $5.4 million in the quarter and $22.3 million for the year.", "In 2009, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be in the range of $100 to $120 million.  Depreciation will be about $145 million and amortization will be about $24 million.", "I\u2019ll conclude this review with a brief update on the status of our lead pigments litigation.  In Ohio, the Attorney General suit, which was moved to federal court by the defendant\u2019s have remanded back to state court by a federal judge.  The defendant\u2019s have filed a motion to dismiss and are awaiting the state\u2019s response.  We do not yet know how the new Attorney General views this lawsuit.", "In Wisconsin, the Thomas case, a personal injury case tried successfully to a jury last fall has been appealed by the plaintiff.  Briefing has been completed and we are waiting for a hearing date.  Another individual plaintiff case has been heard on appeal by the Supreme Court on the question of whether lead pigment is an inherently defective product.  A decision should come out within the first few months of the new year.", "In California, the State Supreme Court has agreed to consider the question of whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency counsel to aid them in their suit against the former manufacturers of lead pigment.  Briefing is ongoing and oral arguments should not take place until at least the third quarter 2009 with a decision by the Court some months after that.", "That concludes my review of our results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008.  So I\u2019ll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2009.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Bob, and good morning everybody.  Thank you for joining us today.  On the eve of the Revolutionary War, Thomas Paine, one of our country\u2019s founding fathers wrote the now famous line, \u201cThese are the times that try men\u2019s souls\u201d.  I think those are apropos words for today\u2019s call.", "So after visibility in the U.S. economy in the last year was simply unprecedented.  Financial markets, business and consumers, all reacted strongly to the growing economic uncertainty.  Businesses and consumers both reigned in spending, and nervous investors ransacked stock exchanges around the world.  Each time that we thought that things couldn\u2019t get any worse, in fact, they did.", "I think it\u2019s safe to say the fourth quarter of 2008 was the worst quarter for the global coatings market in decades.  The recession that has pummeled demand for coatings and other building materials in the domestic markets for the past two years, expanded to global markets in the second half of \u201908.  And the catalyst for recovery is simply nowhere in sight.", "It is becoming increasingly difficult to forecast our business with any degree of confidence.  For this reason, we considered suspending our long-standing practice of providing sales and earnings guidance.  But we believe that offering even a broad range of expectation has value and we will continue to practice or providing guidance.  More on this topic in a moment.", "The rate of decline and end-market demand makes our experience throughout the year and, particularly in the fourth quarter,  coupled with a sharp increase of raw material costs during the first half reduced our sales and pressured our earnings all year.  Simply stated, we are not pleased with our results for 2008, but we do believe that we took appropriate and decisive actions in response to difficult conditions we encountered.  These actions were focused primarily in three areas.  Mitigating the rising input costs through cost control, as well as pricing actions; growing market share; and maximizing net operating cash.", "The dramatic spike in raw material costs early in the year took us somewhat by surprise.  We had expected a more gradual rise in the range of 3% to 6%, as I think we shared with you earlier in the year.  In response to the steeper than expected increases, we took immediate and aggressive steps to reduce SGNA manufacturing and distribution expenses, and implemented appropriate selling price increases to help offset some of the impact on our margins.", "During the year, our paint stores group closed 79 stores that were located in close proximity to other stores, as well as reducing non-essential overtime and part-time service hours.  We consolidated some sales territories and focused our selling efforts on market segments and customers that offer the highest potential for share growth.", "Operations at seven manufacturing and distribution sites remained idle and were closed during the year and we trimmed administrative expenses across the organization.", "Concurrent with these expense reductions we implemented multiple price increases across most of our business units and product lines. These were all difficult steps to take, but their impact on our results were timely and meaningful.", "The challenging market conditions last year did not discourage us from continuing to make prudent investments in an effort to capture share.  For example, our paint source group opened stores in 100 new markets.  Packing up the store closures, we finished the year with 3,346 stores in operation, and increase of 21 net new facilities over year end 2007.  Our global group added 22 net new branches, including our first company operative location in India.", "At the end of 2008, our global group had 541 company operated branches.  We continue to invest in research and development and introduced some important new product technologies to the market in 2008.", "Four our sale divisions, we recruited 667 high-caliber people into our respected management training program.  We are confident these investments will benefit the company in the near term and deliver appropriate returns in the long-term as well.", "You know, strong cash generation has always been a focus of our company.  In 2008, we generated net operating cash of $864 million surpassing 10% of net sales for the third consecutive year.  This strong cash flow performance was due in large part of a $121 million decrease in our year-end working capital.", "As a reminder, our working capital ratio defined as accounts receivable plus inventories, left accounts payable to 12 month sales, decreased to 11.2% in 2008 from 12.7% in 2007.", "During the year we also continued to invest the company\u2019s cash to create value for our shareholders.  Again, for example, we invested over $70 million to complete three acquisitions, strengthening our industrial coating businesses in and outside of North America.", "It required more than seven million shares of our company stock or treasury, reduced our total debt by more than $130 million, and returned a portion of our net operating cash to shareholders in this form of a cash dividend.", "2008 marked our 30th consecutive year of increased dividends, a string we intend to continue.  At our February meeting of our board of directors, I will recommend approval of a dividend payout rate for 2009 above our traditional 30% of prior year\u2019s earnings per share in order to continue our strength, our consecutive annual dividend increases.  This recommendation will be made as a result of our strong net operating cash performance and our commitment to return cash to shareholders.", "Looking ahead to 2009, we believe the rapid deterioration we saw in the United States and many international markets during the fourth quarter will continue at least through the first half of this year.  Industry volumes in most markets will erode to the point that positive volume growth in the first six months is highly unlikely.", "Given this dismal demand outlook, we anticipate that our first quarter consolidated net sales will decrease in percentage terms in the high single digits to low teens compared to the first quarter of 2008.  The sales at that level, we estimate, diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.25 per share compared to $0.64 per share earned in the first quarter of 2008.", "For the full year 2009, we expect net sales will decline in the low to mid single digits versus 2008.  With annual sales at that level we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2009 will be in the range of $3 to $4 per share compared to $4 per share earned in 2008.  Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and I will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you.  We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  (Operator instructions)  Thank you, our first question is coming from Saul Ludwig from Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Bob Wells", "Good morning Saul.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "You had this improvement in the gross margin, which was astounding considering the precipitous drop in volume.  Can you talk about the factors that have allowed you to grow higher gross margins in the quarter?", "Sean Hennessey", "Saul, this is Sean Hennessey, and when you take a look at the gross profit in the fourth quarter, one of the things that allowed us to have that $46.2 was really the LIFO expense reduction.  And so without the LIFO, you see the $45.1 there, you don't see it, but it would have been $45.1, not the $46.2, which still is an improvement and we felt that at the end of that third quarter, we did mention that we were at a trough of gross margins, but with the raw coming down in the fourth quarter, I mean adjusting in the fourth quarter, our LIFO expenses were adjusted so our expenses came down because now we went the other way.  We had expense too much LIFO in the first three quarters, so without that, our gross margin at 45.1 for the fourth quarter, we are pretty pleased with.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Next question; in your supplemental sheet you show that the fourth quarter included a loss of $14 million on the sale of assets.  I assume that's separate from the good will impairment, and which segment bore the brunt of the loss on asset sales.  At $14 million, that's a lot of earnings-per-share hit.", "Sean Hennessey", "You are absolutely right.  It\u2019s not included in the good will impairment, it actually is plus the good will impairment, and when you take a look at the majority of that, that was in the consumer group.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay.  And then also your fourth quarter included a $10 million currency loss versus a gain a year ago.  Where did that show up, or where did that benefit show up?", "John Ault", "Saul, this is John Ault.  The foreign currency gain shows up primarily in our global finishes group, although there is some impact, as well, on the administered segment on a much lower basis.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "So that loss that was one of the factors that caused your global group to have such a horrible comparison, because when you add back last year\u2019s special charge, the sacrament was fairly dramatic.", "John Ault", "That's correct.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Yes.  Okay.  And then, finally, how much are you assuming in your revenue forecast for \u201909, Chris?  How much of that do you think is priced that you will get from carry-over from this year that you will have for all of next year, assuming no further price increases?", "Chris Connor", "Okay, the big impact in the forecast for \u201909 is obviously on volume and demand.  The pricing activity that we have taken throughout the year 2008 has, as Sean commented, gone in pretty much as expected. We expect to have some pressure to be able to hang onto that, but for the most part the guidance that we\u2019re giving for \u201909 is going to be mostly attributed to a fall-off in volume.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay.  Do you think that prices, 4% or 5% increase is reasonable?", "Sean Hennessey", "As a company, you know we probably are in that ballpark.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Great, thank you very much.", "Sean Hennessey", "You know, Saul, what we\u2019re trying to do, really, is to really just comment and we widened our range because instead of walking away from guidance, we tried to give you some kind of indication.  We are trying, instead of going down the list of the margin or SG&A, we are trying to really give guidance to some sales and EPS, but the one other thing that we would like to comment on is the other item that we would like, which is our pension expense.  And because of the change in the asset values in our pension, our expense will increase by 55 to 60 million pretax in 2009 versus 2008.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Your pension expense or pension income?", "Chris Connor", "Well, we're going to go from a pension income to a pension expense, so that difference will be 55 to 60 million pretax, which is going to be around $0.32 for the year, which is going to be about $0.08 a quarter for us.  So, that has been our forecast, and that has been our guidance.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Thank you very much.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thanks, Saul.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of FTN Midwest Securities.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Bob Wells", "Good morning, Chuck.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Chris, can you talk about the concept in '09 of price increases in raw materials.  They seem like they are pulling back, and how that affects margins.  I can think of a scenario where you simply raise prices and raw wrap off, or you give back a little on price because raws are dropping even faster than expected, but you are still seeing some benefit in the gross margin line.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.  Let me comment, Chuck, on the pricing thinking of the company, and then I am going to ask Bob Wells to weigh in a little bit on the raw material issues.", "As you know, Chuck, our historic practice has been not to comment on pricing activities until we've announced them to our customers, and to this point in time we've announced no pricing activities for calendar year 2009.  We probably, given this environment, would find that to be a difficult thing to accomplish, and I think that the raw material forecast and the volatility there again makes it a little difficult for us to have a lot of visibility into that.", "Bob, you may want to comment a little bit about what we're seeing there?", "Bob Wells", "Yes.  Traditionally, Chuck, as you know, we provide raw material cost guidance for the industry on our calls, and frankly, we're hesitant to do that on this call.  We are absolutely expecting continued volatility in the energy markets this year, which when you combine that with the fairly significant portion of our raw material baskets that's driven by factors other than energy \u2014 factors like capacity, transportation, labor, capital investment, and down to even ore prices, it makes it very difficult in this environment to forecast raw material costs.", "So, if we do see a trend of price stability in the future, including intra year, we'll return to giving specific raw material guidance, but at this point we're going to hold off on giving a range.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Sean, with regard to looking at the gross margin, up for the quarter, down for the year, can you look at either one of those and say if we held price and raws sort of constant, it would kind of impact volume (inaudible) had on those numbers?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.  I think mathematically, you are going right down the right path.  You can see it, but that will do.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Well, I am asking for a little help on that.", "Sean Hennessy", "I know, Chuck, and again, this has been probably one of the \u2014 with the volatility, we have about four or five different algorithms that get us back inside of our range and we've got different algorithms in the gross margin for all of those variables, and to give you guidance on okay, I think it is X \u2014 in the past we have always said we think our year-end gross margin will be close to where we were last year or this year or that year \u2014 we're going to avoid doing that because with all the volatility, it is going to be tough to do that.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Yes, certainly.  I think that is fair.  A couple of other things, are you \u2014 besides the pension in your guidance, do you have any assumed impairment charges or room for impairment charges over the course of '09?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, Chuck.  We really don't.  But when you ask \u2014 the first question was no, and the second question when you say is there room \u2014 with the accounting rules today with the way things are \u2014 a couple of years ago we had about a 4 million, we had about a 3 million, so if it is \u2014 in my mind, if our impairment charge is 5 million or less, that is pretty much a zero.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Gotcha.  And what's the acquisition environment like right now?", "Chris Connor", "Well, we continue to have opportunities to discuss targets.  The fact that this year saw three deals compared to seven the year before would indicate that there is a slowing, and I think that will continue.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Chris, is that due to buyers expecting a little more than you want to pay in this environment?", "Chris Connor", "Probably.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Okay.  Last question, did Euronavy close yet?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 FTN Midwest Securities", "Congratulations.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silverstein of Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Good morning.  A lot of my questions have been answered, but I would just want to follow up on a couple of things.  First of all, can you look at your coatings business outside of architectural to the extent that you have some small industrial and marine and maintenance businesses.  What was the performance there like in the fourth quarter versus the architectural business, and what's the outlook for the segment versus the consumer paying segment?", "Sean Hennessy", "Sure, Dmitry.  The industrial coating segments of our company, in previous quarter last year we had commented had been performing slightly better than the architectural, but certainly in the fourth quarter as the global economics lowdown occurred, these businesses began to struggle as well, and pretty much behaved right in line with the total company's performance.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  And what is going on currently and the outlook for the near term is as pessimistic for the industrial applications as it is for the consumer applications?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.  The guidance we've given for the year with the demand down and (inaudible 00:36:38) would be consistent across architectural and industrial coating.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  In the same vein, can you make comments on various geographic reasons?  You talked about revenues being down in all regions of all the world and in all segments, but was there a region that was doing better or worse than the others?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.  We've commented historically, particularly in our stores' organization to give you kind of a feel in North American about how that flowed.  I think that for the last probably two years now, we've been commenting that our southeastern division has been lagging our other divisions.  This is the part of the country where most of the new residential home construction is taking place, or most of the impact of the downturn has taken place.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Right.", "Sean Hennessy", "The midwestern part of the United States, not as affected.  It's done well.  Our southwestern division has done well.  These are historic southwestern corner of the United States market, which while there's some home building down there, we're seeing some strength over there as well.", "But you know, we're really splitting hairs here because it's pretty much broad base across the board that we're feeling the stress in the architectural markets across the United States.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Are any international markets doing better?  I mean, you're still experiencing growth in Latin America and Asia, or is that turning negative \u2014", "Sean Hennessy", "Our business model, Dmitry, is primarily a western hemisphere model.  Most of our global coatings outside of North America are in Latin American markets.  Brazil has had a reasonable year.  We've commented on that frequently.  We've been helped by currency through three of those four quarter.  Now that's turning off a little bit, and as we commented, those markets are slowing as well too.", "So, while they have the potential to be somewhat positive, I think the impacts for the company, given the currency turn, will be a rough year in our Latin American operations as well.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Got you.  And then final question, and I'm just trying to come at the raw material outlook from a different angle, what's the percentage of your raw materials spend as the part of cost of goods sold or revenues?  Can you give us an idea how much you're spending.", "Sean Hennessy", "Sure.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.  When we take a look at this, what we've always said is that raw materials were around 50% of the average selling price of paint.  So, when you take a look at the percentage of the cost of goods sold, it's definitely tremendously higher in there because we have the gross margin.", "So, if you think about our gross margin being around a 44, 45, 50% of the selling price as raws, you can take about 5 to 6% of our sales as other; the conversion, the logistics, and the freight.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  So the vast majority of cost of goods sold it sounds like, from a \u2014", "Chris Connor", "Yes, exactly.  North of 80%.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  So, when raw materials start coming down, and this could be a big tailwind, provided that you can maintain pricing, which my understanding is at least historically at the retail level, same prices \u2014", "Chris Connor", "That's the key phrase you just said, Dmitry; maintaining pricing.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  All right.  Thank you.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thanks, Dmitry.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from PJ Juvekar of Citigroup Incorporated.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Incorporated", "Yes.  Hi. Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, PJ.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Incorporated", "Yes.  I am surprised by the weak results in the global finishes group, even after taking out the FX impact that profits were down 29%.  Was the volume growth positive in the quarter in the global group?", "Chris Connor", "We have never really commented on unit buying as by segment, but I think you can tell.  We talk about the sales without the conversion in the \u2014 with prices, and you can probably take a guesstimate of where that ended up.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Incorporated", "Okay.  Sean, can you explain the reduction in asset impairment charge in that segment of $11.6 million?", "Chris Connor", "The asset impairment that we took was really dealing with trademarks, and that segment, that was just from an acquisition that was from prior years that the cash flows, you take away the cash flows, and the discount of the cash flows.  We just had to write down some of the goodwill.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Incorporated", "So it's a reduction in impairment charge?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Incorporated", "Okay.  I'll follow up on that.  And finally, Chris, do you think the international consumer is more likely to delay painting in a slowdown than a U.S. consumer?", "Sean Hennessy", "Oh, that is a great question, PJ.  I have no idea.  We've been through economic downturns obviously many, many times in the company's history, and recently in Latin America as well.  We've made it, and I think we have commented about the Argentinean economic collapse in the first half of this decade and that our company experience had some valid gains through there.", "So, we expect soft demand in our Latin American operations this year.  I think it'll behave somewhat similar to the way the U.S. will behave.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Incorporated", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, PJ.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Amy Zhang of the Goldman Sachs group.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.  Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Amy.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I have several key questions.  And the first one is really the follow up on your pricing.  I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the competitiveness of the environment.  And obviously your rates are priced fairly aggressively in '08 and with some very nice carry over impact in first half of '09, and I heard Sean was essentially saying you expect a 5% price increase in this year.", "But whatever \u2014 I heard a lot of your competitors already stopped raising prices in the later part of (inaudible) and then expect a flat pricing trend for them.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.  Let me clarify that point.  We have not announced any price increases this year.  I think the question that Sean was answering was the impact of the price activities announced in 2008 as they carry forward into 2009 and would have the impact of about a 5% lift for us.", "But more clearly to your point, all competitors are experiencing difficult volume issues and we think pricing is going to be a difficult prospect for the company this year.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So, for the first half of '09, because of the carry over impact, do you think that 5% price increase could have some negative impact on your volumes, given many other competitors, they've probably started to give up some price and will just stop doing the price increases.", "Chris Connor", "That will be the challenge that management has to work on is to react to the market environment along those lines.  Our guidance here in the range that we provided this year, which is much wider than we've historically done, recognizes the fact that that's one of the many moving parts that we're going to have to manage through.", "Time will tell, and we'll obviously be reporting on that on a quarter by quarter basis.  You'll be able to see how we do.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can you give us just a little bit more color on your customers\u2019 reaction to your price increase in the fourth quarter '08?", "Chris Connor", "Well, we didn't raise any prices in the fourth quarter of '08.  The last \u2014", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Sorry.  The positive impact from the previous two price increases you announced in second half.", "Chris Connor", "So, as we continue to implement the pricing actions that we took throughout the first half, primarily of 2008, the customers reactions were historical in terms of how we've been able to pass them through.", "We've said that typically it takes us the better part of 12 months to get them in, add completion, we're somewhere in the 70% range achievement, plus or minus a few points, and that these price increases have performed in that same fashion.", "So, there were no issues in the fourth quarter that would change the discussion on how that's happened historically for us.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great.  And then a second question, SG&A has presented itself as a 30 some percent for 4Q and then I understand there is probably some charges there.  Just going forward, how would you think of it, that ratio?  Obviously, that's a historically high level, and I understand you guys have a lot of operational initiatives in the pipeline, and then what should we expect there?", "Chris Connor", "Well, if we take a look at the top line sales that we've given you, then we're going to be down in the mid single digits.  We would have to drop our SG&A down in the mid \u2014 by that same percentage to have the same percent of sales.", "I would say that again, we're not going to go down the P&L and give you guidance, but I wouldn't be surprised if your guidance showed that the SG&A as a percent of sales was higher next year.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  Thank you.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Amy.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JP Morgan Chase and Company.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "Hi.  Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "In the fourth quarter, can you talk about the demand pattern that you experienced?  In other words, if you compared October to November to December, sort of what were those monthly trends like?", "Sean Hennessy", "Jeff, the trends were pretty consistent, and the amazing trend was actually in the back half of the third quarter when it really began kind of in September there was a significant and consistent demand drop across all segments.  And then the fourth quarter months all pretty much ran at the same level, down in this double-digit demand that we've been talking about.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "And in your forecasts for next year you have a very low number in the first quarter, and then relatively much higher numbers for the successive three quarters.  I take it that that has to do with some kind of rebound in the possibility of your paints stores business, given that that's the largest segment by far.  Is that the case, and why is it that paint stores would be very depressed in the first quarter and then would meaningfully pick up?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.  I think there is a couple of factors at play here.  First of all, the trends coming out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter have not changed, and that's the guidance that we've giving.  These are our two smallest quarters of the year \u2014", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "Yes.", "Chris Connor", "There is some movement there which has a bigger impact on us.  We do think that a couple things could impact better performance in the back half of the year.  One, the comparisons will get easier as we go up against this significant falloff that we had in the back half of '08, and secondly, like you, we're reading some indications that if there's going to be any kind of stabilization, a flattening of this demand curve is likely to happen in the second of this year.", "Again, I just would go back to the wideness of this range that we've provide the investment community this year, which indicates how difficult pegging this volume is for the company.  We're giving you a point in time best look, we're going to have to wait and see how that falls through.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "In the global group, I think in answer to Saul's question, you said that there might have been a 10 million currency hit.  Is that something that is sort of one-time only, or is that something we might see in the successive quarters?", "In other words, is your global group annualizing an operating profit of around 100 million or is it more like 60 million?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.  I think when you take a look at it, and we've commented the high percentage of our business is really in Latin America.  You look at the currencies, specifically the Brazilian real and so forth, and you think well, look at the curves \u2014 you look at the curve that we've just gone through where now the exchange rate is back to 2004, but I know that it's between that 60 and 100.  I'd have to go through and do some calculations to give you \u2014 but really when you take a look at \u2014 I understand the question, I just don't have that \u2014 I would have to work it out.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "Well, maybe if I could just ask it differently.  What's the meaning of foreign currency related losses?  Were these hedges, or was this the effect of currency on the business?", "Sean Hennessy", "No.  It's the effect of currency on the business.  So, when the REI changes, the amount \u2014 and we report in U.S. dollars, that change occurs.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "I see.  That's very helpful.  And then lastly, is the demand trend in paint stores weaker or stronger than the demand trends in the consumer group?", "Chris Connor", "I think it's slightly weaker, given the results that we report on for the quarter.  And here again, so much of the malaise in the demand side is occurring on the commercial and the new construction, and the consumer has little exposure to that, if any, and the stores is bearing all the brunt of that right now.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "What's your tax rate for the year?", "Sean Hennessy", "'08 was \u2014", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "For '09, I'm sorry.", "Sean Hennessy", "It will be in that same ballpark of 33.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan Chase", "Okay.  Thank you very much.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Greg Melich of Morgan Stanley.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi.  Thanks.  A couple of questions; one is on SG&A.  I realize you are not going to give us the number given the volatility, but you did get it to drop in dollar terms, a percent in the fourth quarter, which is a real trend from earlier in the year, (inaudible) setbacks.  What could you reasonably do this year in terms of SG&A dollars, especially given the pension extension which you've already highlighted which make it a couple percent of headwind?", "Sean Hennessy", "Right.  Again, it's hard to answer because I have a specific number in my forecast.  I don't want to give it to you quite honestly.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Maybe just operationally, would it be hours in the stores?  Would you consider maybe some stores not being open as long as you are or just give us some flavor there?", "Chris Connor", "Well, those are all the factors, Greg, that come into play and the stores, for example, do look at all those things aggressively.  We have taken hours out of the stores.  We've managed our part-time hours.  We've paid particularly close attention to our overtime hours.  We'd probably be reluctant to reduce hours.  That's not a place that we would go to look.  We would probably look to more efficient utilization of the hours during the times that the stores are open.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Right.  And then a second \u2014 could you give us just the numbers \u2014 not the forecast, but where we actually finished for all of 2008 in terms of raw materials, pricing, and volume?", "Chris Connor", "For the company?", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes.", "Chris Connor", "We don't give raw material data for the company.  We have given raw material, as Bob said, historically for the industry.  We felt that raw materials \u2014 the last guidance we gave was 9 to 14%, and as the fourth quarter was coming in with some lower costs than we had had earlier in the year, we said that we thought it was going to come in at around 9% for the industry.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And you think that's where it ended up for the year?", "Chris Connor", "That's the last guidance we gave and that's directionally correct.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  And on the other, the volume and the price, again it's historic not \u2014", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.  I mean, the bottom line is, is we've never broken out our sales between volume, price, mix, those type of things, because we have paint in gallons, we have units in Minwax, we have units in brushes and rollers and so forth, so it could be really misleading.  We just don't answer that question.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  Well, is it fair to say that the third quarter to fourth quarter deceleration in comps, which I guess was what, 500 basis points give or take \u2014", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "That all of that and then some was volume.", "Chris Connor", "Correct.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "I mean, that is \u2014", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.  Intuitively, if the price increases one end, sales performance as a negative number was not as negative as the buy in.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great.  Thanks a lot.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research Company.", "[Omar Lee] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Good morning.  This is Omar Lee (ph) in for Eric.", "Sean Hennessy", "Hey, Omar.", "[Omar Lee] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Good morning.  A couple of things, when you look at the year-over-year profit decline in 1Q, your expectation, why is it so much greater than what happened in the fourth quarter?", "Chris Connor", "Well, in the fourth quarter we had some other things.  I've mentioned that the gross margin was helped by the final adjustment of LIFO, and that was over a point.  And when you take a look at it, the third, the fourth, and first quarters, you look at the bell-shaped curve of our sales, you really see that we have a higher percentage of our stores at a below breakeven point.  In the second and third quarters we have that occurring versus the fourth and third.", "And then also I mentioned the change in pension, we have to expense \u2014 we're going to have $0.08 hit in the first quarter that we didn't have in the fourth.  So, adjustments to the final year numbers and then the pension, that's the reason why.", "[Omar Lee] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Secondly, the volume in the industry in the fourth quarter, where did it end up, roughly?", "Chris Connor", "We think \u2014 all year long, Omar, we've been saying that we felt like the industry in volume was down in the 12 to 13-percent range.  We think that definitely the rate of deceleration definitely picked up in the fourth quarter.  We think it could have been easily mid teens or greater.", "[Omar Lee] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "About mid teens or greater?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "[Omar Lee] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "On the cost side, going back to raw materials for a moment, the expectation had been coming out of or entering third quarter 9 to 14% growth and then obviously high single digits was kind of the expectation.  Where did cost increase end up for the year in total?", "Chris Connor", "We don't know that data point, but you're exactly right, Omar.  The last guidance we gave was at 9 to 14% and that it was turning towards the bottom of that, which was the high single digits.  To the best of our knowledge, that's where it ended.", "[Omar Lee] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Okay.  Going back to price for a quick second, and last thing, just walk us through the price contribution.  I think it was mid singles, maybe 5 or 6% was where you had talked about seeing the realization of the third quarter.  Where did it kind of end up at the end of the fourth quarter, the price, and kind of the contribution relative to the third quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "It was very comparable.  It was slightly higher in the fourth than the third.", "[Omar Lee] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Okay.  Great.  Thank you, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Omar.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Steve O'Neil of JJB Hilliard.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Bob, I think you're just going to have to help me with the asset impairment charges, or the phrasing about increased impairment charges in each of the segments is just confusing me.  Would you please just tell me what they are.", "Bob Wells", "Sure.  Yes, hang on.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Otherwise I am going to add them up incorrectly and I'm going to do them wrong (laughs).", "Chris Connor", "For the year, the goodwill and trademark impairment was $46 million, and of that we took 22.5 million in the fourth quarter and 23 in the second quarter.  And we also took, and I'm sitting here looking for the breakout here \u2014", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Actually, if I could just have the fourth quarter and full year for the segment, that would be fine because that's where I \u2014 and I think maybe the number a year ago may have changed a little bit, I want to make sure I have it correctly.", "Bob Wells", "Okay.  Steve, I think in our press release, we do break down the impairment charges by segment, and the paint stores (audio silent 00:58:30 - 00:58:33) group, the increased asset impairment charges were 42.7 million for the year and 22.3 million in the quarter, and that's just the year-over-year change.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Right.  And I don't think there was an asset impairment charge in the paint stores last year, so it would have been 22.3 million.", "Bob Wells", "That's correct.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "So, you said it was a $3.8 million increase in the consumer group for the quarter, what was it in absolute dollars?", "Bob Wells", "It was 8.1 million for the consumer group in the fourth quarter of '08 \u2014", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Okay.", "Bob Wells", "\u2014 and 4.2 in the fourth quarter of '07.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Okay.  And see that's very well \u2014 okay, that's fine, because 4.2 and 3.8 is eight, but I was rounding, but okay, that's fine.  And then it was 11 million a year ago in the global group \u2014", "Bob Wells", "That's correct.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "But you said 11.6 or so was actually a positive 0.6 \u2014 I think somebody asked this earlier.  It was actually positive 0.6 in the fourth quarter.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.  Last year we were going up against history of 11.6, and the impairment this year was 800,000, a positive of 10.7.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "For the quarter?", "Chris Connor", "That's correct.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Okay.  But then you said 10.8 million for the year, but I thought there were \u2014 or is that just the absolute number because if that was the only charge for the year last year was 11 million.", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Okay.  And then I think I can figure it out from there.  Or what was \u2014 just to be sure in the consumer group for the full year of 6.6 million?  What was the asset number for the year for the consumer group?", "Sean Hennessy", "Impairment, 11 million dollars.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Even for the consumer group?", "Sean Hennessy", "Well, 10,975 \u2014 $10,975,000, I rounded to 11.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "And then I think this was asked earlier and I just want to follow up about the loss on assets sale, that would have been \u2014 that would not have occurred in the corporate or in the administrative, that would have actually been extracted from the consumer group operating profit?", "Chris Connor", "That's correct.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes it is.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "And then along the same lines, the foreign exchange impact is not something that's accumulated (inaudible) gone into the global group operating income?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Okay.  So both of those figures are understated by those factors then?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "Okay, great.  Thank you very much.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Hi, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Hey, Dennis.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "I have a couple of questions here, but hopefully they'll be quick ones.  On the raw side, I understand the hesitancy with forecasting anything, but if you were to just take what you're paying for raws today, and assume that stays constant for the year, can you give us a sense of what the annualized change would be '09 to '08?", "Sean Hennessy", "No.", "Chris Connor", "No.  Nice try, Dennis.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "I told you it would be quick, right?  How about on the stores, can you give us a sense of what your plans are as far as openings and closings?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.  I think that last year as we counted in the net was 21, and I think we're going to be close to that range again for 2009.  There shouldn't be nearly as many closings as we had this year, but I don't think we'll be as aggressive in new market penetration.  The net numbers should be very close to where we finished this year.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay.  And on your end channels you mentioned through the quarter it was fairly comparable in total, where there any more significant changes on a relative basis by end channel that either \u2014 I don't know if it would have to be weaker, but that got weaker through the quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "In terms of specific customers?", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Not customers, but just end channels as far as whether it's as best as you can analyze it by the new construction, repair, remodel, non-res, industrial \u2014", "Chris Connor", "You know, the one market that we've commented that has been doing slightly better in this environment is the property management market.  As folks get out of homes that they don't belong in and move back into rental equipment, that segment is done marginally better, but still negative.", "With that modest little trend, all of them are pretty consistently down significantly.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay.  So, on the pension extend, how much of that will flow through the segments as opposed to corporate?", "Chris Connor", "90% will go to the segments.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay.  And then I think you talked about this, but I just want to make sure.  On the currency impact, do you have a ballpark of what would be included in the guidance range?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, but sort of like on the raws, we're not going to answer that one.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay.  Thanks a lot, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Dennis.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Vlad Arkimono (ph) of Coastal Capital Management.", "[Vlad Arkimono] \u2013 Coastal Capital Management", "Hey, guys.", "Chris Connor", "How are you doing?", "[Vlad Arkimono] \u2013 Coastal Capital Management", "Good.  My question is on the guidance.  Basically, as I can see it, you're projecting very steep declines in revenue in first quarter, and EPS of roughly a quarter of last year's EPS.  And then you proceed on the call to state that you see no improvement whatsoever in the environment coming, and at the same time, you project a full-year EPS that implies a very big turnaround in the remainder of the year, and the same for the revenues.", "So, how can you possibly project such a huge turnaround and an implied EPS for the remaining three quarters in the year that are roughly the same as the three quarters of EPS in '08, while the environment is dramatically, dramatically less.", "Chris Connor", "Yes, Vlad.  I think when we're talking about the environment, the sense is that the demand has dropped to the second half of this year and it's kind of flat lining now at this level.  At the current volume run rates and the guidance we're giving, as we go through the year we start to have much better favorable comparisons.  This is the worst quarter that we're going to have in terms of volume and also in terms of raw material cost impact on a year over year.", "So, as the year goes on, if we don't see further deterioration on the demand side, our visibility at this point in time would indicate to your point that the subsequent quarters get a little bit better.  And then we don't have quite the deterioration in earnings that we've seen in this first quarter.  That's the best we can tell you at this point in time.", "Sean Hennessy", "The other thing I would just like to point out is that again, the change in the pension is $0.32, that's $0.08 a quarter.  $0.08 on 64 is one-eight, 12.5%.  It is 32 out of $44 is one-eight \u2014 I mean, it is a little less than that.  And when you take a look at it, we're also in \u2014 Chuck Cerankosky asked me and I said we don't have as much impairment in this year, and impairment cost us $0.32.  So, when you sit there and start taking a look at it, there's a lot of other moving factors.", "[Vlad Arkimono] \u2013 Coastal Capital Management", "I understand on the pension and on the impairment stuff, which I acknowledge them, but they don't seem to be the defining factor.  But I just wanted to come back to the comparisons becoming easier.  How are comparisons becoming easier when the second quarter of last year was quite good and the third quarter was not bad either while \u2014", "Chris Connor", "We've tracked the gallon demand to our stores through this cycle, Vlad, and I can just tell you that that's a critical factor and we're not forecasting the significant volume declines on top of the double-digit buying declines through the second half of this year.  At the same time that that's happening, the raw materials start to get a little bit more favorable for this forecast that we provided.  So, those two drivers, along with the other thing that Sean's mentioned, support the guidance that we've provided.", "[Vlad Arkimono] \u2013 Coastal Capital Management", "Do you project improvement to begin in the second quarter of '09, or how are you projecting it internally?", "Sean Hennessy", "We're not projecting improvement in this plan at any quarter.  We're just projecting better comparisons in the latter half.", "[Vlad Arkimono] \u2013 Coastal Capital Management", "All right.  Thanks.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.  There are no further questions at this time.  I would like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Bob Wells for closing comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks again, Jackie.  Let me conclude our call this morning by asking you to save the date of Wednesday June 24th on your calendars.

(VAL) F1Q09 2009 Earnings Call February 23, 2009 11:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Lori A. Walker \u2013 Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "William L. Mansfield \u2013 Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer", "Analysts", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Prashant Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Operator", "Welcome to the first quarter earnings conference call.  (Operator Instructions).  I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Ms. Lori Walker.  Please go ahead.  ", "Lori A. Walker", "Welcome to our first quarter earnings conference call.  Bill Mansfield, Chairman and CEO, is with me on our call this morning.  A couple of brief comments before we begin, first, I would direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning, which contains much of the information that we\u2019ll be covering in the call.  Also, a quick reminder that this call is subject to the forward-looking statements language contained in our press release as our comments this morning may include forward-looking statements as that term is defined by securities law.  ", "This morning I\u2019ll review our first quarter results, Bill will make a few comments and then we\u2019ll get to your questions.  Despite the difficult economic environment, our earnings for the first quarter were in line with our expectations.  First quarter sales totaled $639.5 million down 16.4% from last year driven by a volume decline and unfavorable currency.  ", "Adjusted for currency and acquisition, sales were down 14%.  First quarter adjusted net income per share was $0.20 in 2009 and $0.24 in 2008, excluding non-cash adjustments of $0.03 per share for Huarun minority interest shares in both 2008 and 2009 and a $0.06 per share charge in 2009 related to restructuring actions.  ", "Net income for the first quarter of 2009 was $14.2 million.  First quarter reported earnings per share were $0.11.  Net income for the first quarter of 2008 was $24 million.  First quarter reported earnings per share in 2008 were $0.21.  ", "For the first quarter, our reported gross margin was 29.6% or 30.4% after excluding the impact of our restructuring actions up from 27.5% in the first quarter of 2008.  The margin improvement was driven by a combination of carryover pricing, improved product mix and productivity gains in our manufacturing facilities, which were offset by higher raw material costs.  ", "Operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, were down approximately $5 million or 3% for the quarter driven by benefits from our previously completed restructuring actions and tight control of expenses.  As a rate to revenue, operating expenses were 23.6%, excluding restructuring, which were up 330 basis points from 20.3% in the first quarter of 2008.  The increase as a rate to revenue was due to de-leveraging on the decline in sales.  ", "The tax rate for the first quarter was 34.9% this compares with 34.5% in the first quarter of 2008.  We expect the effective tax rate for the full year to be 33.5% to 34%.  We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.  Average shares outstanding were down 752,000 from a year ago with the decline related to the shares that we repurchased last year.  Average shares outstanding were 100 million for the first quarter and are projected to be approximately the same for the second quarter.  ", "Recapping our sales performance for the quarter, our core growth defined as volume price mix was down 14% primarily driven by a volume decline that was partially offset by carryover pricing.  Currency was negative 3.1% and acquisitions were up 0.7% for the total decline of 16.4% in the quarter. ", "Looking at our segment results, paint sales declined 7% and were down about the same when adjusted for currency and acquisitions.  Demand in the big box channel and our Huarun business held up better than the dealer and mass merchant channels.  ", "Our coating segment sales declined 20.5% and were a few points better when adjusted for currency and acquisitions.  Sales volumes were particularly challenging in our coil, general industrial and wood product lines.  Sales in our other category, which includes resins, colorant, gel coats and our furniture repair business, declined 19.7% driven by our gel coat business and were a few points better when adjusted for currency and acquisitions.  ", "Addressing margins for the quarter by segment, and this excludes restructuring charges, our coating segment EBIT margin was 8.6% up from 8.3% in the first quarter of 2008.  Our paint segment EBIT margin was 7.6% down 40 basis points from 8% in 2008.  The EBIT margin for our other category was negative 10.7% compared with negative 8.1% in the first quarter last year.  ", "As a reminder, our other category includes corporate expenses.  Excluding restructuring charges, the total company EBIT margin for the quarter was 6.7% essentially flat with our 2008 first quarter margin of 6.8%.  ", "Moving to the balance sheet, total debt at the end of the first quarter was $998 million up $75 million from the end of last fiscal year due primarily to the expected seasonality of operating cash flows.  We\u2019re estimating that year end debt for fiscal year 2009 will be $825 million assuming no acquisitions or share repurchases.  This implies free cash flow after dividends of approximately $100 million.  ", "Our total debt to capital ratio at the end of the first quarter was 41.4% with net debt to capital at 39.3%.  We ended our quarter with $345 million of reserved liquidity that includes $264 million of available committed credit facilities and $81 million of cash.  We believe we have liquidity well in excess of our anticipated funding needs for fiscal 2009.  ", "Capital spending in the first quarter was $10.8 million up from $8.6 million in the first quarter of 2008.  Our forecast for capital spending for the full year is approximately $60 million.  Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $20 million up from $19.5 million in the first quarter of 2008.  Our full year forecast for depreciation and amortization is approximately $80 million.  ", "Let me give an update on the restructuring actions that we had initially announced last August.  During the quarter, we expended the efforts to further reduce our cost structure.  We now expect the total cost to be $0.35 to $0.38 per share up from the $0.23 to $0.25 per share estimate we discussed on our fourth quarter call.  ", "Of the total restructuring cost 60% is cash and 40% is non-cash.  To date, we have taken $0.22 per share in charges, $0.16 per share in fiscal 2008 and $0.06 this quarter.  We expect our restructuring actions to be completed by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2009.  In fiscal 2010, these actions are expected to generate annual savings of $0.20 to $0.23 per share up from our previous estimate of $0.13 to $0.15.  ", "With those comments, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Bill.  ", "William L. Mansfield", "We\u2019re in a global recession and our first quarter results reflect this reality.  Our earnings were in line with our expectations and in line with the guidance we issued last November.  As Lori reviewed, we were able to mitigate the impact of a significant decline in sales and increased raw material cost.  We held our operating margins to a modest 40 basis point decline.  ", "The quarter benefited from carryover pricing and improved product mix, a significant increase in manufacturing productivity and lower interest cost.  Valspar employees did an excellent job controlling expenses, delivering the operational discipline required in the recessionary environment, and most important generating new business despite the economic downturn.  ", "The biggest challenge we faced during the quarter was sales volume.  After a November decline that was in line with our expectations, December sales dropped sharply then recovered in January back to expected levels.  As we anticipated sales in or coil, general industrial and wood product lines were all off shapely.  ", "Wood continues to be impacted by the weak housing market.  In coil and general industrial, volumes were impacted by a dramatic drop in global demand.  Commercial construction, heavy equipment, and consumer durable were particularly hard hit.  Year end customer plant closures were also longer than normal as the companies we serve worked to reduce their inventories.  ", "We saw far more modest volume declines in architectural, automotive refinish, packaging and Huarun.  Our relative performance in architectural was particularly encouraging where market data indicate we are continuing to gain share and improve our competitive position.  ", "Just a brief comment about our restructuring, we initiated these actions last July well in advance of the significant downturn in the global economy.  Our first quarter results benefited from these actions.  As Lori mentioned, we expanded the effort during the quarter to further reduce our cost structure.  ", "We\u2019ve closed two additional plants for a total of six since the efforts started and our global headcount is now down more than 10% since January of 2008.  These are always difficult steps but absolutely necessary given today\u2019s economic realities.  ", "Looking ahead, as you saw in our press release, we continue to expect our earnings for the year to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.65 per share, excluding restructuring charges.  Let me mention a few of the key factors behind our outlook.  ", "The first factor is sales.  We are not assuming our markets will strengthen in any meaningful way in the foreseeable future.  We are expecting a difficult sales environment to continue through 2009, particularly in our coil, general industrial and wood product lines, which account for about 40% of the company\u2019s revenues.  In the remaining 60% of the company, we expect a slight improvement as customers complete inventory adjustments and we gain new business.  ", "The second factor is raw materials.  As Lori mentioned, our raw material costs were higher in the first quarter of 2009 than they were in the first quarter of 2008.  We have not fully recovered the significant increases in raw materials we experienced in 2008, which were particularly pronounced in our third and fourth quarters of last year.  We expect to see some easing in raw material costs in the back half of 2009.  ", "Finally, we will see additional benefits from our restructuring actions, continued productivity improvement resulting from our Lean Six Sigma initiatives and continued tight control of expenses; in summary, a difficult environment in 2009.  ", "We have strong brands and differentiated market positions that we have made stronger with our investments in global markets over the past several years.  We are controlling expenses, working capital and employment levels, and we have committed bank credit facilities and reserve liquidity in excess of our anticipated funding needs.  Despite the difficult environment, we still expect to generate $100 million of free cash during this year.  ", "With those comments, I\u2019ll now open the call up for your questions.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).  Your first question comes from Steve Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.  ", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.", "Can you give us a feel for the timing of the benefits from the restructuring?  I think under the original plan you were looking for maybe $0.07 to $0.09 a share this year.  How much of the additional benefit do you expect to see this year?  ", "Lori A. Walker", "Steve, the $0.07 to $0.09 was what we were assuming in terms of the cost for the restructuring previously, and we had said that the savings would be about the same primarily in the back half of the year.  And in terms of the increase in the restructuring, that will be completed by the end of the third quarter of the expectations, and the benefits, again, would be in the back half of the year.  ", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.", " ", "So is it still $0.07 to $0.09 this year because you\u2019re now looking for about $0.08 more.  ", "Lori A. Walker", "It\u2019ll be a little bit higher based on the new actions that we\u2019ve taken.  ", "", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp.", "Then just in taking a look at this gross margin improvement here.  You had almost 300 basis points and that just off your current revenue level is worth about $30 million in gross profit.  Can you give us an idea of how much of that was from restructuring versus pricing?  ", "William L. Mansfield", "Probably not.  That\u2019s a level of granularity I don\u2019t think we\u2019re prepared to get into.  Clearly, restructuring benefit the gross margin and that was my comment about a substantial increase of manufacturing productivity that we saw during the quarter.  We also benefited from an improved mix and, probably for the first time in many quarters, mix truly did contribute to an improvement in the gross margin.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank.  ", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Can you talk about further pricing benefits in Q2 and the ability to hold pricing going forward given the very weak macro environment?  ", "William L. Mansfield", "David, I think the issue is simply in the first quarter, as I said, our raw material costs were higher in the first quarter of \u201909 than they were in \u201908.  The raw material cost environment today is very difficult to predict.  We are aware that most multinational chemical companies have announced substantial plant shutdowns.  It\u2019s unclear to us what that will entail.  So I really can\u2019t tell you what might happen on a go forward basis.  ", "With respect to pricing, I would echo the comments I made in the fourth quarter conference call and the comments I just made, which is we haven\u2019t completely recovered from what occurred last year, and that we will do what\u2019s the right thing for our shareholders and for our customers over this next very difficult period of time. ", "", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "And Bill, can you discuss some of the inventory levels in both the paints as well as coating segments in particular at the big box retailers?", "William L. Mansfield", "Let me comment on the paint segments first.  Those inventories to us appear to be in reasonably good shape and it\u2019s not on our radar screen as an area of concern.  What is less clear to us is in the coating segment.  ", "Certainly in the first quarter there was, in our opinion, a substantial effort by all of our customers on a global basis to take their inventories down.  Has that process finished?  We think it might have but it\u2019s still a little unclear to us on a go forward basis.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup.", "Prashant Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Can you describe for us the business trend in China?  They\u2019ve seen a lot of costs this year with factories shutting down, and now you have a new stimulus package working through the economy.  Can you just tell us what you\u2019re seeing in China?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "What we\u2019re seeing in China is those customers that we serve that participated in the export Chinese market, and certainly you know that we supply a lot of furniture manufacturers in Southern China and we have coil coatings in general industrial business, and that clearly was a sharp downturn as a result of the global contraction.", "With respect to the domestic Chinese business that we have through Huarun, I wouldn\u2019t describe it as particularly robust on the top line.  But it certainly has delivered bottom line results that are quite satisfactory.  On a go forward basis, it\u2019s frankly too early for us to make any comment relative to the stimulus.  We certainly don\u2019t see any impact at this point and time.", "Prashant Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "", "And Bill, you mentioned that these DIY stores were better then mass merchants.  Do you see that some contractors are switching from paint stores to DIY stores?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "No quantitative evidence on an intuitive basis, it\u2019s quite possible that might be the case, although, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily describe it as contractors switching to the big box as the potentially larger issue at work.  When you consider a paint project, if you hire a contractor to do a paint project for you, the biggest cost is labor.  ", "In today\u2019s tough economic environment, is it possible that consumers may be electing to do it themselves, and therefore save the labor component?  I think that\u2019s a reasonable proposition, but as I said before we don\u2019t have any quantitative evidence to support the premise.", "Prashant Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "", "And just final, one housekeeping question, did you say how much your prices were up in 1Q, or can you just sort of give us a rough ballpark number?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "Right around 5%, PJ.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Bob Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "[Amy Young] for Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "This is [Amy Young] on behalf of Bob.  The first question I have is the big box retail that was reported, quite high inventory levels by the end of \u201808, and then also it is as back to take a more aggressive pricing action to maintain the traffic in their stores.  ", "I\u2019m wondering what will be the impact of your pricing power in that kind of scenario, and also can we expect a similar carryover impact on your pricing for instance extending to the second half FY09?  Second quarter FY09.", "William L. Mansfield", "", "First of all, I have no comment on Lowe\u2019s conference call.  I think if you have questions for Lowe\u2019s you need to ask them.  And secondly, we would expect pricing in the second quarter low single digits, Amy.", "[Amy Young]- Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay.  And then my second question is regarding SG&A.  SG&A cost as a percentage of sales during the quarter I think that\u2019s 23.6%.  Now obviously that\u2019s much higher then the trend line we\u2019ve seen over the past quarters or even past several years.", "So can you just provide a little bit more color on that line on what should be the range or we should think about for SG&A\u2019s percent of your total sales going forward throughout the FY09?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "I think, as Lori mentioned, she directly commented on this issue.  And that per, SG&A expenses of sales, is solely a function of the decline in sales in the first quarter.  The reality of the situation is that our ex-restructuring, our SG&A expenses on an absolute dollar basis are down.", "[Amy Young]- Goldman Sachs", "", "Okay.  And then do you have any guidance for what we should expect for that line going forward?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "No.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "A few questions, were there any asset sales in the quarter or any gains of any sort?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "No, there weren\u2019t Jeff.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "What was the operating cash flow in the quarter?", "Lori A. Walker", "", "The operating cash flow was actually a use of cash of around $60 million.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "You spoke of raw materials being up.  Did your price increases offset the raw material cost inflation in the quarter or price net?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "No probably not.  What we saw, Jeff was our raw material cost continued to increase through the beginning of our first quarter.  And it was only until really last month or so where we started to see some moderation, if you will.  ", "And I think on an overall basis, with respect to pricing, I have to look back at the dramatic increases in the entire third and fourth quarter of \u201808 and say no, we still need more to fully recover.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "Can you talk about the business trends in February and how they relate to the business trends in your previous quarter?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "Well, Jeff I\u2019d have to go back to the comments that I made where we don\u2019t expect an improvement in 2009.  Now we certainly don\u2019t expect a repeat of December where it really was down sharply.  So I would tell you February is tracking about what the November and specifically January trends were.  I don\u2019t see any material improvement, nor do I see any material down that would indicate that December might repeat itself.", "Lori A. Walker", "", "Yes.  Q1 was probably accentuated by the fact that there was that inventory destocking that occurred, particularly in that December time period.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "I guess just a very last question.  Roughly your sales were down $126 million?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "That\u2019s correct.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "", "And your gross profits order of magnitude were down about $16 million.  I guess that just seems relatively small relative to the sales drop, not withstanding any restructuring actions that might have had a positive benefit, so I was just wondering how you get that?  Why are the numbers so good?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "Frankly, I don\u2019t think people fully understand how variable our cost structure is, and I don\u2019t think folks realize that we got a very early start.  I\u2019ve talked in the past calls that we\u2019re managing the company and have been managing the company as if we were in recession.  ", "I talked about that in early \u201908, and I think what\u2019s occurred is that these things all take time to gain traction.  So initiatives and things, controlled expenses, manufacturing productivity, any number of things we were doing, frankly, as a result what our experience was in the housing downturn and its impact on the company, we are gaining substantial traction now.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I guess lastly the all other revenues went from $65 to $52 million, and your loss was about flat at around 5.5, at least as I calculate it.  How did you do that?", "William L Mansfield", "Well, first let me comment on the revenue issue and then Lori can comment on the profit issue.  That revenue decline fundamentally reflects almost a collapse in the gel coat business, which supplies gel coats to the marine boat industry and parts of construction industry, showers, tubs things like that, which are 100% directly correlated when new housing starts.", "So that business has really dropped off and the balances of those businesses in that segment are doing fine.  It\u2019s just such a dramatic change in the one business.", "Lori A. Walker", "That and just what Bill said the rest of the businesses are doing fine, plus you did also have a reduction in the corporate expenses with along the tight control of expenses.  So the combination of that is what allowed you to be able to hold the loss in essence to be relatively flat year-over-year.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, because that segment seemed to perform better than all the other segments even though the revenue drop was most extreme.  ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "", "Lori, in each of the three segments what was the dollar amount of restructuring cost that went against each of them? ", "Lori A Walker", "", "The total amount of the restructuring is about $9 million, about $7 million is in [coating]; it\u2019s pretty much nothing.  It's a couple hundred thousand in paints and then other has $1.6 million.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "So absent, as Jeff was talking about, absent that restructuring charge other did terrific on the sales drop.  On interest expense, which was very favorable, what do you think interest expense might be on a run rate going forward?", "Lori A Walker", "", "Roughly about 40% of our debt is floating rate debt so we were able to take advantage of the drop in rates here in the first quarter.  But we will probably think about terming out some of our short-term debt during the year, so I would not assume that the first quarter run rate is a good rate on the full year.  And we are assuming in our guidance that the interest expense will be higher than the first quarter run rate.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "You think the in second quarter it\u2019s going to be around this $12 million number?", "Lori A Walker", "", "I think it will be a little bit up, but more in the back half.  I think it will be up.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "And what do you expect your interest for the full year to be as part of your guidance.", "Lori A Walker", "", "I would say flat to down slightly from where we were last year.  ", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Down slightly from where you were last year, which was what around $58 million?", "Lori A Walker", "", "Roughly.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "So you think this year we should think like 55 or 54?", "Lori A Walker", "", "That\u2019s in the ballpark.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay.  So have you done any refinancing yet?", "William L Mansfield", "", "No, Saul, we have not.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "And what are your thoughts in doing that?  Are you just using credit lines or are you going to the capital markets or given the current environment for financing, what are your thoughts on how to best do the additional financing that you are looking to do?", "William L Mansfield", "", "Well, number one, we don\u2019t feel we have to do anything at the moment.  And number two, I think it will be premature for us to comment.  Whether we choose to do something or not will be opportunistic relative to what conditions we see in the capital markets.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "But in the guidance you\u2019ve assumed you are going to do something, which would come at a higher rate than just staying with the short-term.", "William L Mansfield", "", "Conservative, that is correct.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay.  And then finally from the top line standpoint where your results in the first quarter reflected both macroeconomic conditions and of course the stocking in which you net down 16%.  Were you saying earlier, Bill, that you think in subsequent quarters your revenues are going to be down but maybe not quite as much as the 16% that you saw in the first quarter?", "William L Mansfield", "", "I think that\u2019s a reasonable conclusion from the comment, Saul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Couple of questions, you mentioned the fact that your manufacturing sponsors are very variable, which was indicated by the fact that despite the volume drops you\u2019ve actually improved gross margins despite the raw material cost.", "Are your SG&A expenses then by the same token much more fixed in the sense that the decline in volumes got such a big impact on SG&A as a percentage of sales, you weren\u2019t able to offset them the same way you were off setting gross margin impact?", "William L Mansfield", "", "I think that\u2019s probably a fair conclusion.  Although, let me think about this for a second, Dmitry.  I would tell you that back in late \u201908 when we were looking at restructuring, a lot of our focus was on the issue of volume, expected volumes, effective recession on the manufacturing complex and so we took action.  We have been all along since late \u201907 been taking action on the SG&A line on pretty much a global basis.  ", "So what I was particularly pleased with in manufacturing was, along with the restricting, which certainly had a beneficial impact, our manufacturing folks were able to manage very, very carefully their existing employment cost, existing discretionary spending to match what happened on the volume line and we were quite pleased with that.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  Secondly, in terms of volumes I would assume that the volume declines in coatings were significantly higher than in paint, but in terms of pricing when you talked about getting 5% price increase, was that mostly in the coating segment or was there still some carryover in the paint segment as well from last year?", "William L Mansfield", "", "There\u2019s carryover in the paint segment from last year, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "And just to make sure when you talked about the your Huarun operations, as well as your packing results, you said they were not down as much as other segments of industrial but they were still down.  So packaging in this quarter was down as well as Huarun even though it\u2019s mostly for the internal Chinese market?", "William L Mansfield", "", "On a Huarun basis, they had some top line pressure.  We saw some impact.  ", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "And on the packaging portion of your industrial sales?", "William L Mansfield", "", "In packaging we saw some inventory corrections occurring pretty much on a global basis with large consumer food and beverage companies that we supply.  And we also saw some significant deterioration, is probably the right word to use, in demand in the Eastern European countries, particularly Russia.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  So packaging clearly is more resilient than your other industrial business and clearly they\u2019re not immune to what is going on in the economy here.", "William L Mansfield", "", "No.  I think on a relative basis they\u2019re outperforming but not immune.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  Then final question, on your raw material comments just want to make sure I understand them.  You saw the surge in the third and fourth quarter.  It depends on how you look at it but maybe they peak here in the first quarter and maybe coming down sequentially, but you don\u2019t expect year-over-year benefit to begin until the back end of the year.  Is that the correct way of interpreting it?", "William L Mansfield", "", "That\u2019s absolutely correct.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "And even with the raw material pressure still being felt significantly in the first quarter and to some extent into the second quarter, the restricting actions you\u2019ve taken and the shutdowns you\u2019ve done in the plants still allow your gross margin to comp positive year-over-year.  That is quite an accomplishment and do you expect that to continue and then maybe accelerate as raw materials start being a benefit?", "William L Mansfield", "", "Let\u2019s take the first half of your comments.  Let\u2019s not forget the impact of mix.  ", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "What was the effect of mix? ", "William L Mansfield", "Low single digits.  And relative to the second part of your comments I think at this point that\u2019s a bridge too far.  I think we have to see how the economy plays out here over the next two quarters.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay.  And the mix improvement that was just a case of lower margin business declining faster than the higher margin business, correct?", "", "William L. Mansfield", "Exactly, Dmitry. ", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "Bill, I cover some of your raw material supplies and wish all my companies to do well, however I\u2019m still amazed at, given the significant drop in volume and enterprise, your raw materials index is not full and prosper and deeper as it should be.  So you told us about the recession, did you call your suppliers and tell them there is a recession here?  ", "William L. Mansfield", "I didn\u2019t because I probably didn\u2019t think it would have an impact.  I understand your point.  What we said was our average raw material cost in the first quarter of \u201909 which is the November, December, January period were higher than what they were in \u201908.  We also said that we continued to see pressure a slight upward movement in that November, early December period, and then things start to change in January.  ", "Now, I will tell you that we saw some amount of change to your point in Asia, and on a go forward basis, I don\u2019t know what the impact from all this shutdown capacity will be and we\u2019re being conservative in how we manage the company.  We\u2019ve been conservative last year and also conservative on how we see things on a go forward basis.", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay.  Bill, what are you expectations for the overall market change in architectural paints volumes in 2009 in the U.S.?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "You know, unclear to me.  I had a conversation with a major supplier to the architectural market, their model, which is somewhat well respected, says down 10%.  After what\u2019s happened in \u201907 and in \u201908 it\u2019s somewhat difficult to comprehend another down 10.  I\u2019m just happy and overjoyed that our branding proposition in the Valspar brand has enabled us to perform better than the market no matter where the market ends up, Sergey.", "", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Lastly, given your strong performance, do you see a potential for Valspar to become a little bit more active in maybe some small incremental acquisition?  Today you can buy for a couple bucks a cup of coffee in Subank, so presumably the variation multiples must have come down since our last discussion December here in New York.  Any change here you see in the competitive landscape in terms of M&A opportunities?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "No, other than I\u2019ll make a comment.  I really couldn\u2019t tell you what the appropriate price to pay today for any acquisition is because it's still unclear as to where the economy is going to settle out in what I will call the new world order, for lack of a better term.  ", "Operator", "", "Your last question will come from Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets.", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "I think that\u2019s the last 12 questions, Bill.", "William L. Mansfield", "Okay, Mike, shoot.", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "We\u2019ll keep it to a couple, if we would follow on your insights on acquisition pricing that also comes down to obviously raw material costs etc. and volatility that can be in this kind of market.  How are you thinking about how you\u2019re trying to set up your inventory in this kind of environment?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "Well, we took our inventories down last year.  Our inventory performance from a working capital investment basis, quite good in the first quarter, so in essence what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re going short on inventory and very carefully monitoring our customer service levels because it\u2019s not a smart play to go short on inventory and compromise your customer service levels.  So I\u2019m pleased with how our folks are managing that dynamic.", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "What would lead you to go longer on inventory?", "William L. Mansfield", "", "An upturn in sales. ", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Bill, could you comment a little bit on realizing this is tough, your assumption as to how much drawdown took place in your segments in the quarter looking at your customers.", "William L. Mansfield", "You know, I can\u2019t.  And it's not because we haven\u2019t tried internally to get our minds around it; it was so quick, so fast, that when you look at the sort of global evidence it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s a drop in demand.  But also we may have noticed that about every company that reports earnings these days talk about their balance sheet.  ", "And so all our customers are focused there also and everyone\u2019s trying to do the same thing, which is to pull cash out of the pile.  And so clearly there was a significant inventory correction but I cannot quantify it.", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Any comments at all on capacity utilization in businesses?", "William L. Mansfield", "In Valspar businesses, Mike?", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Right.", "William L. Mansfield", "You know, again as I said in the past, that\u2019s not a metric that I think personally is meaningful in our business.  We\u2019re not a major petrochemical operation that is highly capital intensive that has to run 24/7 or the fixed costs start becoming a major problem.  We can ramp up and down our production by going from seven days to five days, from three shifts to two shifts in fairly short order.  And part of that flexibility showed through in our first quarter results where we were able to adjust quickly our manufacturing profile.  ", "So I don\u2019t look so much at utilization because the fixed cost burden is not as high as in other industries, but what I do look at is our ability to respond quickly in both a situation where demand is soft and just as important as when it turns back up, do we have the flexibility and can we move quick to supply our customers' increased demands.", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Last one, could you comment a little bit on what you\u2019re trying to do in this environment within Huarun tactically?", "William L. Mansfield", "Well, tactically we\u2019re still focused on Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, in penetrating and further opening up new distribution.  Strategically that effort continues and I would tell you has probably been enhanced despite the overall environment and we expect that that\u2019s a winning strategy, at least for Huarun, and we\u2019ll deliver.  As we execute and move forward, we\u2019ll deliver a substantial revenue and earnings accretion to the Huarun model.  ", "Michael Hamilton \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Are you getting any opportunities off of what you\u2019re seeing from competitors, or is it just too early to assess?", "William L. Mansfield", "Yes.  I think that\u2019s too early to assess.", "William L. Mansfield", "Okay.  I believe that was the last question, if I remember correctly.  So to summarize, thanks everyone for participating in the call today.  Our earnings for the quarter were in line with our expectations.  We reaffirmed our guidance for the full year.  Valspar\u2019s meeting the challenges of the global recession.  We have liquidity in excess of our funding needs and we expect to deliver $100 million of free cash in 2009.  ", "And with those concluding comments, thank you again for your participation and we look forward to talking with you during our second quarter conference call in May.

I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "", "In order to allow more time for questions we provided balance sheet items and other selected items on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations second quarter press release.", "Summarizing overall company performance for second quarter 2009 verses second quarter 2008, consolidated net sales decreased $281.7 million or 12.6% to $1.95 billion, due primarily to weak paint sales volume by all divisions and unfavorable currency translation rates.", "Unfavorable currency translation reduced consolidated net sales 2.2% in the quarter, and acquisitions completed since June 30, 2008 increased net sales in the quarter by less than 1%.  Consolidated gross profit dollars decreased $77.6 billion for the quarter to $895.3 million.", "Gross margin increased to 46.0% of sales from 43.6% in the second quarter last year.  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $24 million in the quarter to $653 million, but increased as a percent of sales to 33.5% from 30.4% last year.", "Interest expense, net of interest and investment income, decreased $7.6 million compared to second quarter last year.", "Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $24 million or 9.4% compared to second quarter 2008, to $232.1 million.  Our tax rate in the second quarter was 31.9% compared to 33% in the second quarter of 2008.  For the full year 2009 we expect our effective tax rate will be slightly lower than last year's rate of 33.3%.", "Consolidated net income decreased by $13.7 million to $158 million from $171.7 million in the second quarter of 2008.  Net income as a percent of sales was 8.1% up from 7.7% in the second quarter last year.  Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased $0.10 or 6.9% to $1.35 per share.", "Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our paint stores group in the second quarter 2009 decreased 13.7% to $1.17 billion.  Comparable store sales or sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months declined 13.5%.  The decrease in paint stores group sales was the result of weak demand for architectural and industrial paint and non-paint items across most end user segments.", "Regionally in the second quarter of '09, our Southwest Division led the sales performance followed by Easter Division, Midwestern Division and Southeastern Division.  Sales in all four divisions declined in the quarter compared to second quarter 2008.", "Segment profit for the group decreased $17 million or 8.1% to $193.5 million in the second quarter 2009 due primarily to lower volume sales that were partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices, reduced SG&A expenses and a second quarter 2008 impairment charge totaling $20.4 million.  Segment margin increased to 16.5% in the quarter from 15.5% in the second quarter last year.  Paint stores group opened six new stores and closed five stores in the second quarter.", "In the consumer group for the second quarter 2009 sales decreased 4.5% to $366.5 million due primarily to lower volume sales to most of the group's retail customers.  Segment profits for the consumer group increased $7.3 million or 12.3% in the quarter to $66.1 million.", "Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 18% in the quarter, from 15.3% in the same period last year, due primarily to favorable sales mix, reduced operating costs from facility consolidation, lower freight and other distribution costs, and a second quarter 2008 impairment charge of $2.7 million.", "Turning now to our global finishes group for the second quarter '09, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $79.2 million, or 16.2% to $409.7 million, due primarily to lower paint sales volume and unfavorable currency translation rates that were partially offset by acquisitions and higher selling prices.  Sales in local currencies decreased 7.7% in the quarter and acquisitions added to group's net sales by 1.6%.", "Segment profit for the global finishes group in U.S. dollars was $31.2 million in the second quarter of '09, compared to $48 million for the same period last year.  The decrease in segment profit was due primarily to lower sales, poor fixed cost absorption related to lower manufacturing volumes, and unfavorable currency translation rates.", "Segment profit as a percent of net external sales was 7.6% in the second quarter of 2009, compared to 9.8% for the second quarter last year.  Global finishes group opened one new branch and closed nine n the second quarter.  All facility closures were in North America.", "I'd now like to comment briefly on some of our balance sheet items.  Our total debt on June 30, 2009 was $800.7 million including short-term borrowings of $499.2 million.  Total debt on June 30, 2008 was $1.24 billion.  ", "Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $49.3 million.  Total borrowings-to-capitalization were 31.6% at the end of the quarter, versus 42.7% at the end of second quarter 2008.  Long-term debt-to-capitalization was 14.8% at the end of the second quarter this year, compared to 15.5% last year.  ", "In the second quarter 2009, the company purchased 500,000 shares of its common stock in the open market, bringing our total year-to-date purchases to 1 million shares.  At June 30, 2009, the company had remaining authorization to purchase 18.75 million shares.  In second quarter 2009, we spent $18.5 million on capital expenditures.  Depreciation expense was $37.3 million and amortization expense was $6 million.  ", "For the full year '09, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $80 million to $90 million, depreciation will be about $145 million to $150 million, and amortization will be about $24 million.  ", "I'll conclude this review with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation.  In Wisconsin, the plaintiffs in the Thomas case have appealed the 2007 jury verdict.  Briefing has been completed and we are waiting for a hearing date, although the case has been stayed indefinitely, due to the bankruptcy filing of co-defendant Millennium Holdings. ", "Another individual plaintiff case in Wisconsin, the Godoy case, was heard on plaintiff's appeal by the Wisconsin Supreme Court on the sole question of whether white lead carbonate pigment is defectively designed because it contains lead.  ", "On Tuesday, July 14, 2009, a unanimous Supreme Court rejected the plaintiff's claim.  The court held that the complaint failed to state a claim for defective design because lead pigments necessarily contain lead.   The case will now be remanded back to the trial court, where it will proceed on the defendant's alleged failure to adequately warn of the dangers of white lead carbonate pigment.  ", "In California, the State Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingent fee counsel to aid them in their suit against the former manufacturers of lead pigments.  Briefing is completed; oral arguments should not take place until at least third quarter of this year, with the decision most likely coming in early 2010.  ", "And finally in Mississippi, the Gaines case, a single plaintiff lawsuit was tried to a jury in Jefferson County beginning on June 16, 2009.  On June 25, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding $7 million in damages.  The company is in the process of filing post-trial motions seeking a judgment in its favor, or failing that, a new trial.  If the trial judge denies both motions, the company will appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court, as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial.  This process will likely take 15 to 24 months.  ", "Two other suits, brought by minors, are pending in Mississippi, although neither is in Jefferson County, which is notorious for large plaintiff's verdicts.  ", "That concludes my review of the results for second quarter 2009, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year.  ", "Chris Connor", "", "Our second quarter results were largely in line with our expectations; however, they were below last year's performance.  In this sense we were disappointed.  It's always difficult to find much satisfaction in declining numbers regardless of the economic environment.  We are obviously not immune to the effects of this global recession, but we are pleased with the progress we're making in many important areas of our business in this environment.  ", "These improvements will provide significant earnings leverage when buy-ins begin to stabilize.  For example, in our paint stores group, we continue to strengthen our control distribution platform by opening new stores and consolidating redundant store locations.  Our paint store count in the U.S. and Canada now stands at 3,340 locations, compared to 3,302 one year ago.  ", "We expect our paint stores group will open approximately 40 to 50 new store locations during 2009 and slow the rate of redundant store consolidation to finish the year with about 25 additional stores in operations over our current store count today.  We continue to see growing strength and positive mix change towards our premium product lines, and we are confident that we continue to register market share gains in many of our important professional painter market segments.  ", "Our consumer group continues the important work of right sizing our asset base in-line with the contracting market value, and we closed 14 facilities in the past six quarters.  We believe we are in good position with these changes to capitalize on the eventual uptick in gallon demand.  Additionally, we've been pleased with the sales efforts, positive mix shift, and shelf expansion from this group, with a number of our key retailing partners.  And finally, our global finishes group continued to expand into new markets, bringing the group's total branch count to 533 locations at the end of last quarter. ", "Our ongoing efforts to manage our fixed asset base in line with declining sales volume, increase our productivity, and protect the price increases we implemented during 2008, will help to move our consolidated gross margin back toward our more normalized levels as the year progresses.  ", "SG&A expense decreased $24 million in the second quarter, compared to the second quarter of 2008.  A particularly noteworthy achievement, considering we've supported three new acquisitions, covered incremental store closing costs and added 40 net new stores since the second quarter of last year.  ", "Our progress in gross margin improvement, and in reducing SG&A expense, interest expense, and our effective tax rate resulted in a 40 basis point improvement in second quarter net income as a percent of sales.  ", "Our working capital ratio also improved to 13% of sales at June 30, from 14.1% at the end of the first half of last year.  Through a combination of response to production planning that held inventories in line with sales volume, and prudent management of receivables and payables, we reduced our working capital funding requirements by $57.3 million in the first half of 2009, compared to the same period of 2008.  ", "Net operating cash in the first six months increased by $3.6 million to $266.4 million.  Reduction in working capital requirements more than offset the $54 million decline in first half earnings.  Free cash flow, operating cash minus CapEx and dividends, increased $33.6 million as we appropriately pared back our CapEx in the first half of this year.  ", "In the 12 month period from July 1, 2008 to June 30, 2009, we've generated $880 million in net operating cash.  We've invested $68 million to complete three acquisitions, $87 million in capital additions and improvements.  We've reduced our total debt by $431 million and purchased $105 million in treasury stocks as well as paying $165 million in cash dividends.  ", "We believe the significant challenges that we faced in the first half of 2009 will certainly continue into the second half.  Based on industry estimates for full-year 2009, the past three years have erased a decade of buy-in growth in the U.S. architectural market.  Although we do not believe industry volumes are sustainable at this low level over the long-term, any significant impetus for recovery has not yet materialized and we believe the recovery itself will be slow once it begins.  ", "Our outlook for the third quarter 2009 is for consolidated net sales to be down in the range of 10% to 13%, compared to last year's third quarter.  With sales at this level, we expect diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $1.15 to $1.45 per share, compared to $1.52 per share for the third quarter of last year.  ", "For the full-year 2009, we have again revised our sales expectations and now believe net sales will decline in the range of 11% to 12.5%, compared to full-year 2008.  With annual sales of that level, we are updating and narrowing our diluted net income per common share expectation to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.80 per share, compared to $4.00 per share last year.  ", "Finally last week, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.355 cents per share, up from $0.35 last year, keeping us on track to achieve our 31st consecutive year of increased dividends", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions).  Your first question comes from Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "This question is related to the consumer division in your facilities, a couple parts, how much did you incur in expenses related to closing facilities in the quarter, and I assume they would be included in the consumer group?  And then excluding whatever that number is, were your fixed costs in the consumer group down and, if so, by how much?", "Sean Hennessey", "Saul, it's $6 million in the six months, $2.8 million in the three months and I don't think we've ever divulged what our conversion costs are.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Were they lower?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes.  I don't think we're ready to start giving that kind of metric out.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Then a question on the administrative line, Sean, your interest cost was down sharply.  I guess I was a little surprised that your administrative number wasn't off more sharply than it was.  I wonder if you could provide a little color on that administrative number and what we might expect, as we look out to the balance of the year", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes, when you sit there and take a look at the six months, Saul, we're about $17 million, $17.5 million lower; of that, interest expense is $13 million.  And just the admin spending and reductions that we've taken here are almost $9 million.", "So when you take a look at what it has actually cost us, it's really the first six months of an environmental and the timing of environmental.  We think for the full year, environmental will be fine, but just in that first quarter and second quarter, our environmental expenses were a little higher than what we expected and that's what dampened that difference between the first and second quarter.", "Going out, we think we're still going to control SG&A expenses.  I think that our interest expense is \u2013 we think we're in pretty good shape.  The interest rates that we're paying for short-term right now are around 60 to 65 basis points, so when you take a look at where we are with interest right now, we think we're going to have a nice year for interest expense savings.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "So the administrative numbers should continue to trend lower?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Eric Bossard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company.", "[Mark] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "", "Good morning, guys, it's actually [Mark] stepping in for Eric.  First on the gross margin line, you talked about normalization in the second half.  Any sense for if it can stay around the 46% that you posted this quarter, and how should we think about gross margin going forward and into 2010?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes, I think what Chris had said is we've done a lot of work over the last couple of years to just recover our gross margins and, when you take a look at the first six months, it's 45%.  If you look at the last four to five years, if you look at where our gross margin was at the end of the second quarter, it's been within one or two-tenths of that at the year-end, for the full year, because a lot of the pricing activities have already occurred and a lot of the activities are when you take a look at the production of paint and so forth.", "When you take a look at the full year, I'll just say I think, in the full year, when you compare it to that 45%, I would expect that our gross margin would be in that 45% to 45.5% range for the full year.", "[Mark] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Secondly, on the SG&A, less progress this quarter versus the first quarter; should we assume that SG&A can run down 5% in the second half, similar to what you saw ex-items in the first quarter?", "Sean Hennessey", "I think when you take a look at it, we don't give out every line of the P&L here, but when you take a look at it what we've said is we did a lot of actions throughout 2008 and as we continue to anniversary those, you're going to see a lower and lower reduction in the SG&A.", "In the first quarter, we were down 43, second quarter we were down 24 so I would tell you we're just going to continue to annualize that.  I don't know how to answer the 5% number, because we've got a forecast of our SG&A and I don't want to give that number out, but I would tell you that I think as we anniversary more, you're going to see that reduce.", "[Mark] \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "And quickly on the comp within the quarter, breakout roughly of price and volumes relative to what that number looked like in the first quarter?", "Sean Hennessey", "First quarter or second quarter, I would tell you that it was fairly relatively stable.  I would tell you that you're going to \u2013 our gallonage was down in the high teens, just like it was in the first quarter, and our comp store was different by four-tenths, 13.5 versus 13.1.

Is there a market share shift issue here?  I know it's not just you and them, there are lots of players here, but can you maybe explain why your consumer segment underperformed on sales relative to the DIY sales reported last week by PPG?", "Chris Connor", "I can't comment specifically on PPG's customer mix.  I think, when we looked at the architectural data from the federal government output, that our DIY sales for the consumer group were somewhat in line there.  Beyond that, John, I don't have much to comment on.", "John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research Group", "Do you think there's a substantial different mix of retailers I guess in regions in the business, that that would account possibly for it?", "Chris Connor", "Well, we've commented about the customer mix, PPG DIY base is predominantly with one of the major big box retailers and those retailing partners tend to align with manufacturers.  We've been a strong partner with Wal-Mart which has been doing well in this segment.  I'm not quite sure how their order pattern versus sales out the door went through that quarter, but as we commented in the call, we think that our consumer group's actually doing fine.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research.

What kind of import does that have going forward to some of these cases against Sherwin and your co-defendants?", "Sean Hennessey", "Chuck, in these cases, we have always argued successfully that lead pigment when intact on the wall doesn't pose a hazard to children, and the courts and, in fact, the scientific community has agreed, and we believe that the effort by the plaintiffs to have lead pigments declared a defective product was an attempt to circumvent that argument that intact lead paint, well maintained, is not a hazard, so today that argument remains intact.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "And this ruling, the way the court ruled affirmed that argument?", "Sean Hennessey", "Correct.

That strategy help you guys get a little bit more volumes or just any positive impact in quarter-to-date have you guys already seen from that strategy?", "Chris Connor", "", "Yes that pricing change, Amy, was effective July 8 so we're really in our infancy.  And just to clarify for all of listeners as a reminder, 85% of the volume that goes through our stores aimed at our professional contractors, had no impact or changes in our pricing strategy.", "And the remainder 15% through our DIY, we've left the high end, higher premium quality product lines unchanged.  We simply introduced a lower, in the $20 range, entry level price point product and widened the gaps a little bit in the low to mid-point at the price points.  So those are just going into effect right now.  We'll be able to comment on that after the third quarter.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "My second question is regarding your full-year sales guidance.  Now in fact overall total sales is down 11 to 12.5%.  And if I look at the first six months, your sales down almost 13%, so given that the easy comp from last year on your fourth quarter this year sales number, I'm just a little bit surprised on why you guidance couldn't be a little bit more optimistic with the guidance suggesting a further deterioration in the sales numbers in the third quarter?", "Chris Connor", "", "I think we're commenting based on the environment that we're seeing in the domestic U.S. market for professional painting contractors which is our largest segment.

", "I think as we said in the call there's really no impetus that we're seeing right now for this rebound.  And while some pundits have talked about a second half, we think it's more likely to be out into 2010 at this point in time.

First of all, in terms of your seasonality, revenue seasonality in the third quarter, the last couple of years we've seen third quarter revenues being stronger than the second quarter.  Is that what we should expect this year as well?  I'm talking about the third versus the second?", "Chris Connor", "", "The sequential year-over-year or month-over-month as we've gone through this year have been very much consistent with past practices.  And we'd expect that to be the case again this year.  There's no change in that, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "So we're still looking for modest sequential growth in third quarter revenues?", "Chris Connor", "", "Yes.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Now you talked about pricing obviously being flat sequentially, but year-over-year did I hear Jeff's comment correctly that it was up about 5%?", "Chris Connor", "", "That's correct.", "Sean Hennessey", "", "He used the 5% and we said that's not materially off.  We didn't use the 5%, but yes we \u2013", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "But put it somewhere in the lower to middle single digits let's say.", "", "Sean Hennessey", "", "Right.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Right, just wanted to confirm that.  Secondly another follow-up on Jeff's question, when you talk about raw materials with all the moving parts that you have sequentially obviously there's some seasonal bounce back off of the February-March lows.  ", "But on year-over-year basis if you look at your basket of raw materials was it lower costs and therefore a benefit to you?  And if you care to quantify what that benefit is?  And as you look at the trajectory of raw material price increases last year, assuming normal seasonality this year, do you expect that positive benefit to actually help you more in the second half of the year?", "Chris Connor", "", "Well the first half of the question, Dmitry, there was a modest year-over-year benefit in raw materials in the second quarter.  Going forward it's hard to say, given the volatility in the energy market and that pressure we're seeing now whether that benefit is likely to continue to increase or decrease.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "I'm just looking at a very sharp increase in the slope of raw materials in 2008 and what looks like a more benign slope to the extent that you can extrapolate it.", "Chris Connor", "", "I think that's a fair assessment, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "Okay, so these things should get more positive for you in the second half of the year?", "Chris Connor", "", "Possibly correct, as Bob said, given the volatility doesn't go crazy on us, that's possible.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "And then final question on the restructuring benefits that you talked about that the consolidation of assets and some distribution costing taken out and freight being lower, can you quantify, and maybe not in absolute dollars, but at least where you are in percentage terms in completing your restructuring program?  ", "How much more is left to do in 2009, and if you care to comment on the benefit that you saw in the quarter from these restructuring programs?", "Chris Connor", "", "Yes I'll comment briefly on kind of where I think we are in the process and I'll let Sean give you a sense of whether we're feeling any of that benefit yet or what part of that we'd be willing to share with you.  This has been an aggressive approach to get these facilities down.  I will also comment that the store closings have also been part of that as well.  ", "As a quick reminder, Dmitry, we closed 79 locations last year.  We're probably going to be in the 30 plus or minus a few store locations this year.  And so applying simple math, we're about half of what we did a year ago.  And my guess is that as we head into 2010 there may be half again as much as we did this year in stores.  ", "So we're nearing the end of the need to really kind of get this redundant store closing in place, pretty much on the backs of all the acquisitions that we made throughout the last six, seven years.  That feels like it's in pretty good shape.  The assets in terms of the production capabilities also are in pretty good shape as well for us.  So I would say most of that heavy lifting is behind us as we go forward.", "Sean Hennessey", "I would tell you that we still, I don't have \u2013 I'd have to work up a work up a percentage or even to give you some type of a range, but I would tell you that we do \u2013 we will start \u2013 we will continue to feel more benefit from that, Dmitry.  I don't have a percentage for you.", "Dmitry Silverstein \u2013 Longbow Research", "", "And just maybe this will help you out a little bit.  If you can look at the year-over-year margins which you have been able to deliver in the businesses, particularly the consumer group where you get margins up and the store group where margins were down because of sufficient negative volumes, but it looks like apples-to-apples costs were taken out of that business.  How much of that was related to restructuring and how much of that was related to raw materials?", "Sean Hennessey", "", "And that goes back to when Saul asked that question, I don't think we're prepared to give that metric.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Gregory Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Two questions, one on volume and then a follow-up on another one, if you look at your change in your implied back half assumption, it looks like it's around 400 or 500 basis points from where we were before, and it sounds like from an earlier question that the bulk of that is in how the swing commercial is coming through and little bit different on the residential.  Is that a fair assessment that I'm making?", "Chris Connor", "", "Yes.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Is industrial actually running better than you would have thought or in line?", "Chris Connor", "", "No, I think we're seeing the same kind of softness there as well.  If you just think about the CapEx spending that's being curtailed by most corporations it would have impacted maintenance projects.  This is the time when typically plants would shut down for summer maintenance.  We're not seeing those kinds of work.  ", "Some of the stimulus money that should be flowing in is also taking longer to reach quote \"shovel-ready projects\" so that's being deterred a little bit as well.  So there's definitely softness in the protective and marine segment of our revenue side as well.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So if we were to look at the second quarter in that volume was still running down high teens incrementally versus the first quarter, or just \u2013 was residential down high-single-digit and the commercial was down 30% to 40%?  Is that \u2013 am I thinking the right way?", "Sean Hennessey", "See, Greg, sequentially, obviously first quarter's a small quarter.  If you're looking year-over-year, residential was down, and we look at it in square footage.  You're talking about the market?", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes.", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes, in square footage residential was down in the mid-40s and commercial was down in the range of 50, and that is in square footage put in place.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "For new construction?", "Sean Hennessey", "For new construction.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "For repair or model?", "Sean Hennessey", "That's a little harder to get at.  I mean, commercial repair is down, the property maintenance, mainly because of a large component of that is apartments, and apartment occupancy rates are down.  So commercial repaint has been very weak and as Chris mentioned, not a lot of CapEx spending or maintenance spending on existing buildings.  In residential, probably the segment of the market's that's held up the best is the DIY portion of the residential repaint market.", "Greg Melich \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay.  And then just to confirm, is it fair to assume then that in the third quarter you're running within the sales range that you gave out?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, that's our guidance for the third quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is from PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Quickly, I want to go back to consumer group or DIY channels.  Can you talk a little bit about prices versus volume, and my specific question is that is there discounting going on in hard goods like brushes and rollers to move paint volume in the DIY channel that's impacting you negatively?", "Chris Connor", "I don't think there's been a lot of change in year over year discounting through our retailing partners, certainly through our own stores as well.  This is the time of year where discounts for paint and associated products including brushes and roller, which you mentioned, would be going on.  We're not seeing them any more aggressive or specific than they might have been in the past.  And I don't think as a result then that we're being negatively impacted by that one way or the other.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay, And then secondly, on the industrial paint demand, you talked about architectural, you talked about commercial.  Can you give us a little bit feel for where you are in the industrial cycle and relative to the other cycles because does it bottom out typically six to 12 months later?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, maybe Bob, you can comment on just some of the industry data that we're seeing on projects in this industrial sector?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, and PJ, are you talking specifically \u2013 industrial, obviously is a broad category \u2013 are you talking specifically about protective and marine, or -", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "I'm talking about general industrial, and you have some profitable stores that sell industrial paint.", "Bob Wells", "Right, okay.  Primarily our stores group is industrial \u2013 is protective marine.  There's a couple issues that are really \u2013 a couple areas where we're seeing significant drag on protective and marine.  The protective coating side, structural seal that goes into new commercial construction is off easily to the extent that commercial construction in general is.  So that market's down 50%, which means structural steel coatings are down easily by half.", "The non-building construction is down.  That's a category that we normally see plus or minus low-single digits at worse, is off in the double-digit range, in the mid-teens year-to-date.  So that would be construction like bridges, water, wastewater treatment plants, things like that.  So a lot of infrastructure is not coming out of the ground because it is driven by growth in residential and non-residential building construction.  Does that get to your \u2013", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "No, yes, it does.  It does.  And one quick question for Sean.  Sean, I know you have a financing book with contractors.  Can you just make comment on what trends have you seen there, and any bad loan losses, etc.?  Thank you.", "Sean Hennessey:  Yes, I would tell you that in the fourth quarter if you remember, our bad debt expense started to move up.  I'd say when you take a look at it our DSO looks pretty well.  Past due looks good, but our bad debt expense is higher this year.  And just to let you know that we were running for years in those $20 million to 25 million.  We're now running at about a $36 million in the first \u2013 for the year, so we're up about $9 million in this first half of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question's coming from Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital.", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "A couple questions about maybe towards 2010 rather than this year, you particularly have \u2013 dividend payout was 30% of previous year EPS, hence EPS [inaudible] has been growing.  What are your early thoughts on keeping that number, or keeping that range for 2010?", "Chris Connor", "Well, I think, Sergey, this year our payout has crept up more into the 35%, 36% of previous years' EPS and that's been part of previous years in the 31-year cycle as well, too.  Obviously this is a board of director's decision that management recommends to them.  I think you should take great comfort in the fact that after 31 years of consecutive dividends that we place a high importance on continuing to pay dividends and continue that trend.", "We've also commented on this call and others that the company's cash performance continues to be strong even in this difficult economic environment.  So there's nothing that you should read into any of our comments that would indicate that we won't do anything but continue that policy.", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Continue policy of increasing dividends or \u2013", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Continue policy of keeping the range?", "Chris Connor", "Increasing dividends.", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Good, okay.  And so speaking of cash, I agree in total with your point about a very strong free cash flow generation even in the worst conditions.  What are your thoughts on share buybacks, again, maybe not imminently for the third quarter, but for next year?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes, I think that what we've commented is we continue to buy stock opportunistically.  When you take a look at where our debt is right now, what we have consistently said is we don't believe our shareholders are paying us to manage cash.  I could see the debt coming in slightly below and we'll use that cash to increase shareholder value, and \u2013 which means that I'm sure that we'll continue to buy the stock opportunistically.", "Sergey Vasnetsov \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay, and lastly, just a question on tax rates.  What's your expectation for the rest of this year and next year?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes, last year was, we finished the year at 33.3, and I would tell you that we still think that for the full year we'll be down slightly.  We're actually down for the first six months, 31.9 versus 32.4 last year, but we still think that for the full year we'll be slightly below 33.  And looking at 2010 is really \u2013 haven't really taken a look at that, but long term we think if you look at the last four, five years, our stock, our tax rate's been in that low 30s and we can still see it in that range.", "Operator:  ", "Thank you.  Our next question is from Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Just really had a big picture question for you, Chris, In your comment earlier you had said that you guys haven't seen any signs that a recovery's imminent, but you also I think you that you expect the recovery when it does come to be slow.  Realizing this could be difficult to peg the bottom, is there any reason why you couldn't foresee a stronger recovery given the fact that you had said the last three years have wiped out a decade of volume growth.  So is there any reason why you think the recovery's going to be more muted than maybe we've seen in the past?", "Chris Connor", "I think it's just in our nature to be a little conservative on this guidance, Dennis.  As economies and some of the leading indicators start to talk about more positive performance, we've even seen some of those recently, where we've had a couple sustained months of better results.  Don't forget that painters are using the last guys in for these projects to finish them off, and so I think that kind of mutes the bounce-back that, while some sectors might start to come back a little bit quicker than painters will, I think that's all that you should read into that comment.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay, and fair to say that the \u2013 that they are \u2013 the biggest headwind over the next year and a half or two years is really the projects being build out on the non-res side that you talked about?", "Chris Connor", "I think that's fair.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay, and then just a couple quick ones.  Sean, can you talk about the capacity or the short-term split between the commercial paper and the revolver?", "Sean Hennessey", "When you take a look at our debt at the end of the second quarter, I would tell you that we were actually in the commercial paper.  A majority of our debt was in commercial paper.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "And that's the end of the quarter number?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay, can you give any specific funding outstandings?", "Sean Hennessey", "The outstanding \u2013 our total debt was $800 million, our long-term was $300 and our short-term was $464 million.  I would tell you that the majority of that was commercial paper.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Okay.  And then on the corporate line or the administrative line, if we look at that excluding the environmental and the interest, the number that we should be thinking about in the back half of the year would be similar to the front half.  Is that how you kind of got it earlier?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes.  We don't really give guidance by the segments and so forth, but I would say that the run rate of our administration and costs and so forth probably should run around the same kind of run rate that we've had in the first half of the year, which was down compared to last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Equities.", "Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Equity", "Question about the paint stores first, with the changes you've made to bring more DIY folks in, can you give us any sense as to what DIY transactions did on a sequential basis and then year-over-year in the second quarter?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.  I think you need to be careful here about, you know, all the changes we're making to bring more DIY in and this is a business that has historically generated about 15% of its revenue from our DIY customer base.", "We've had a longstanding marketing effort towards DIY and continue to do so.  The mix is not changing dramatically.  I think sequentially to your point when we've look at our DIY performance, Bob made the comment that that's been one of the better performing or least retreating areas of the architectural paint market.  ", "And we're seeing that through our stores as well.  We've seen some nice weekends on our DIY business, and its performance is a little bit better than the group's numbers overall.  So we don't think this is something that moves the needle dramatically for the company, but it's important business and we're continuing to pay attention to it.", "Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Equity", "Should we expect a pickup or an increase potentially in SG&A in the back half of the year as you all roll out some promotions related to these different offerings that you're doing for DIY at the paint stores?", "Chris Connor", "No you shouldn't, Jay.  Our SG&A expenses will continue to track in the general direction they've been in the first half.  And again, I think we commented earlier in the call that the kind of promotional activities that we're doing are very consistent with what we've done in past years and there's no significant uptick in this plan for this year.", "Jay McCanless \u2013 FTN Equity", "Okay.  And then one other question, I believe you said that the Southwest stores were I guess, less negative than everyone else on a year-over-year basis.  Does that have anything to do with the foreclosure turnover we're seeing in that area or could you give some other commentary behind it?", "Bob Wells", "We've commented in the past, Jay, that most of the \u2013 or I think a significant portion of these foreclosure sales are that the purchaser are investors who are sitting on the properties trying to turn them out into the rental market and making minimal investment in them.  ", "And to the extent that they are, you know, replacing floor covering, doing a little painting, a little electric or plumbing maintenance, we think that probably the big box stores are the primary beneficiary of that business.  ", "Once those homes are put out for sale against \u2013 when the market turns and those homes go back on the market to be flipped for a profit, that's when we think more investment will probably go into them.  That's when we'll see the benefit.  It's likely that our Southwestern division outperformed just because there are some stronger markets down there.  The Texas markets have held up well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve O'Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons.", "Steve O'Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "The only thing that hasn't really been talked about is the international side and I just wondered if you could just comment on the performance of some of your selected international markets?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, I'd be happy to do that, Steve.  As you know, primarily Latin America is where the company's non-domestic revenues are generated.  This year we are facing currency headwinds.  I think about half of the revenue decline in the quarter was attributable to currency.  That leaves us with still a significant single digit decline in those businesses.  ", "And not unlike the United States, we're seeing a softness in a number of those different segments down there.  Starting with Brazil, which is the majority of our Latin American business, plus that largest country down there and it's a country that's been slowing down their rapid growth.  ", "We've seen, as Bob mentioned in some of the earlier questions, the whole gambit of issues, whether it's our industrial coatings to our protective and marine segment down there, some architectural businesses, pretty much across the board.  We sell through our own stores as you know, as well as independent dealers and some of the regions home center chains and pretty consistent performance across all of them in the negative.", "Again, don't see a lot of incidents for change in the near term down there.

You know, earlier you commented that as is normal your third quarter revenues are somewhat higher than your second quarter and that is even with the outlook for commercial construction and new housing that you alluded to.  Do you think that other variances as we go from the second quarter to the third quarter, we should have less FX expense?  ", "We're not going to have the plant closing costs.  Sean talked about lower interest expense and much lower environmental cost.  All of those would seem to imply that with higher revenues and lower of these special expenses, if you will, that your earnings should be higher in your third quarter than in your second quarter.  ", "What is it that could come about that could cause you to be in the 115 to 135, which would be lower than your second quarter in the third quarter?  What are the other variables that maybe we're not thinking about if we're going to get higher revenues and lower other expenses?", "Sean Hennessey", "Well, Saul when you take a look at it, the question was do you thing that your sales \u2013 is the seasonality changing?  I think that if you look at our sales forecast when you take a look at the ranges, the low end of the range actually is below the second quarter.  You can do the math and see that.  So we do \u2013 when you take a look at it there's the sales \u2013 the seasonality hasn't changed.  ", "You sit there and we probably shouldn't have answered that question because that sort of moves the lower end of the range up at the sales fork in our sales forecast.  So we still see uncertainty in the sales.  We still have different things we're working on in the margins.  And to go down there in the SG&A \u2013 to go down I'd have to answer that question.  I don't know how to answer that question without getting very detailed of what our forecasts are and on the every single line.  ", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "The thrust of my logic isn't out in left field.", "Sean Hennessey", "No, it's not in left field.  I can see what you're talking about.  But when you sit there and take a look at it \u2013", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Well we must be missing something big because we're talking about a lot of items here with no plant closing costs, no lower environmental, lower interest costs?", "Chris Connor", "Well first of all, we have plant closing costs that'll definitely go into the third quarter.  The 14 facilities that we've talked about in the last six quarters that have been either shut down or announced to close are still going forward, so we'll have some of that yet to do.  We have some store closing costs to get through in the third quarter as well, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Oh, good.  That's additional clarification, thank you.  And then finally, usually you generate $300 million, $400 million of cash in the back end of the year.  Would you expect that to be any different this year, Sean?", "Sean Hennessey", "Yes.  I think we probably, when you take a look at it from last year to this year, you're taking a look at -we really did a nice job of the working capital.  We're probably not going to have the same type of positive working capital, so it'll be muted compared to last year.  But it's going to be very good cash flow for the next six months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Don Carson \u2013 UBS.", "Don Carson \u2013 UBS", "Two questions.  Just a clarification on raw materials, Bob, you talked about how they're going up and certainly the comps get tougher in Q4 if you look at the benchmark pricing for acrylic and things like that.  What kind of a lag is there before you would see that flow through?  Does that hit you in the fourth quarter, or is there lag into the first quarter?  Just wondering when the significant year-over-year increase in [raws] that might composite a lot of these comparisons?", "Bob Wells", "", "My understanding, Don, is that it depends on the commodity.  I mean the solvents tend to move pretty much in lockstep with movement in the crude market in propylene-naphthalene.  The resins tend to lag.  And plastic packaging tends to move a little quicker.  But it really, it also depends on market dynamics, on -", "Don Carson \u2013 UBS", "", "I'm looking at the specific question being acrylics where we've seen propylene move up because tight supplies which, acrylic suppliers are trying to raise pricing.  Just wondering when you're going to see that because as you get into fourth quarter a year ago comparison is pretty difficult.", "Bob Wells", " ", "Right, it depends.  Typically, historically pricing in the acrylics have lagged, but we're in uncharted territory.", "Don Carson \u2013 UBS", "", "And finally a question, first you mentioned of how we've wiped out ten years of growth in the paint market several years ago when we had the housing boom people used to talk about the coating season in the East and Midwest.  It's extremely wet this year.  Does that cost you much in the way of volume?  And if so is that just kind of deferred to the second half or is that sort of gone?", "Chris Connor", "", "We rarely, Don, give weather reports on here, but I think you're accurate.  It's been a little bit of a wetter, colder period throughout much of the northern markets.  And that's had much impact on the early exterior house painting season.", "Whether that gets deferred to the second half and get caught up in that time will tell.  There's certainly enough painters available to do these homes.  So if people are planning to get it done they'll be able to find a painter.", "Don Carson \u2013 UBS", "", "But no discernable impact on volumes that you can ascribe due to that?", "Chris Connor", "", "We'll see what happens in the third quarter but I wouldn't expect it would be a big mover for us.", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is from Amy Zhang from Goldman Sachs.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you.  Just a few quick follow-up questions and first the questions on the consumer segment, I'm just wondering, have you guys already seen the home centers just within the DIY channel, home centers taking a share from mass merchants and also hardware stores because I remember PPG, last week they commented the home centers actual volume growth pretty meaningful for the quarter.", "  ", "I'm just wondering.  Your consumer business is a little bit weaker than expected, actually weaker than expected for the quarter.  Is that because some market share shifted to the home centers from the mass merchants? ", "Chris Connor", "", "Yeah, we shared that information with you in the past, Amy, when we look at the DIY share for those channels and I think the last time we had a look at it was at the end of 2008.  And the home centers did continue to A, be the dominant share of that market, and B, had improved slightly, maybe one or two basis points in that period.  So I think there's some movement to them for sure.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  Even within the DIY Channel?", "Chris Connor", "", "Yes.", "Amy Zhang \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And my second question, for the paint stores, if we think about year over year trends in the third quarter would you say the comp \u2013 because second quarter the paint stores sales down 13.7% and then adding to the third quarter of this year would you say does the year-over-year trend just stabilized at that level or maybe there's just a modest improvement or there's some further erosion?  How do we think about the trend?", "Chris Connor", "", "I think the guidance we gave for the third quarter would indicate that we're looking at a pretty flat performance second and third quarter.", "Operator", "", "Our last question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "\t", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "", "Sean, as you're looking at the credit markets right now how do you feel about stock buyback in the second half of the year?", "Sean Hennessey", "", "I think it's pretty good.  I think that our liquidity sources are in a good situation.  Our credit facility we're getting close to having less than 12 months, so we are on a short-term there.  I think that you'll see us do some type of multi-year there.  And once we do I think we'll feel pretty good about buying stock then.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Then with no further questions I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing comments.", "Bob Wells", "", "Well thanks again for joining us this morning.  As usual, we'll be available over the course of the day to answer any follow-up questions we didn't get to on the call.

I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Robert Wells ", "", "Thank you. In order to allow more time for questions we have provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations 2009 year-end Press Release. ", "Summarizing our overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2009, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter decreased 5.9% to $1.6 billion due primarily to lower paint volume demand resulting from continued weak economic conditions in the US and abroad. For the full year sales declined 11.1% to $7.09 billion. Sales from acquisitions had no material effect on sales for the quarter or the year. Currency translation rate changes increased consolidated net sales 2% in the quarter and decreased consolidated net sales 1.3% in the year. ", "Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 47.7% of sales from 46.2% in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, gross margin increased to 46% of sales from 43.8% in 2008. Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars decreased $14.8 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year but increased as a percent of sales to 38.7% from 37.3% in the same quarter last year. ", "For the full year 2009, SG&A expense decreased $108.8 million but increased as a percent of sales to 35.7% from 33.1% in 2008. Tight expense management across all operating divisions did not fully offset the effect of the decline in sales on SG&A percentages for the quarter and the year. ", "In the fourth quarter of 2009 asset impairment charges and a loss on dissolution of a foreign subsidiary reduced diluted net income per common share approximately $0.13 per share. Interest expense for the quarter decreased by $5.7 million to $9 million due primarily to a reduction in short-term interest rates. Interest and net investment income was down approximately $1 million in the quarter at $580,000. For the year interest expense decreased $25.7 million due to lower short-term borrowing rates and lower average borrowings. Interest and net investment income decreased $1.5 million in the year due to lower overall rates and lower average investments compared to 2008. ", "Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2009 decreased to 19.5% from 36.6% in the fourth quarter of 2008 primarily due to the tax effect of the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary. For the year, our effective tax rate was 30% compared to 33.2% in 2008. ", "Consolidated net income for the quarter increased by $15.1 million or 30.1% to $65.3 million from $50.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2008. For the year, net income decreased $41.1 million or 8.6%. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 4.1% in the fourth quarter this year from 3% in the fourth quarter last year. This increase was due primarily to year-over-year reductions in our fourth quarter effective tax rate and higher gross margins. For the year, net income as a percent of sales improved to 6.1% in 2009 from 6% in 2008 largely for the same reasons. ", "Diluted net income per common share for fourth quarter 2009 was $0.58 per share including the $0.13 per share impairment charge compared to $0.42 per share in fourth quarter 2008 which included an $0.18 per share impairment charge. For the year, diluted net income per common share decreased 5.5% to $3.78 from $4.00 per share in 2008. ", "Now I would like to review our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in fourth quarter 2009 decreased 11.4% to $920.2 million. For the year, net sales decreased 12.9% to $4.21 billion. For the quarter and year, decreased paint volume sales reflected weakness across most customer segments. Comparable store sales also decreased 11.4% in the quarter and 12.9% in the year. Regionally in the fourth quarter our Southwestern division led all divisions followed by Eastern Division, Midwestern Division and Southeastern Division. Sales by all four Paint Stores divisions declined in the fourth quarter and full year. ", "Segment operating profit for the Paint Stores Group increased 5.9% to $119.9 million in the fourth quarter due primarily to reduced SG&A expense and lower impairment charges that more than offset the decline in sales. For full year, Paint Stores Group operating profit decreased 7.4% to $600.2 million due primarily to the effect of lower paint sales volumes. Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter increased to 13% of sales from 10.9% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2009 increased to 14.3% from 13.4% in 2008. The increase in profit margin for the quarter and the year was due primarily to higher gross margin and lower SG&A and impairment charges. ", "Turning now to the Consumer Group, fourth quarter internal net sales decreased 2.2% to $240.1 million from $245.6 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, Consumer Group sales were down 3.7% to $1.23 billion from $1.27 billion in 2008. The sales declines were due primarily to weak end market demand at most of the group\u2019s retail customers. Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased $7.7 million primarily due to the effect of lower sales and manufacturing volume partially offset by a reduction in impairment charges in the quarter. ", "Segment operating profit for the year increased 12.2% to $157.4 million due primarily to good expense control, reduced asset impairment charges and favorable freight and other distribution costs that were partially offset by lower fixed cost absorption from reduced manufacturing and distribution volumes. As a percent of net sales, Consumer Group\u2019s operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased to 1.9% from 5% last year. For the year, operating margin improved to 12.8% from 11% in 2008. ", "For our Global Finishes Group, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.5% to $437.1 million primarily as a result of favorable currency translation. Sales for the year decreased 11.4% to $1.65 billion due primarily to lower sales volume and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by acquisitions and selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes before acquisitions increased sales in US dollars by 7.8% in the quarter and reduced sales in US dollars by 4.8% in the year. ", "Acquisitions increased the group\u2019s sales in US dollars by 7/10 of a percent in the quarter and 1.5% in the year. Global Finishes Group segment operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased $16.9 million to a loss of $1.1 million due primarily to a $25 million of asset impairment charges and a loss on the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary. Segment operating profits for the full year decreased $87.2 million or 57.3% to $65 million primarily as a result of reduced sales volume, impairment charges and the loss on dissolution of a foreign subsidiary that were partially offset by lower SG&A expenses. ", "A fourth quarter pre-tax loss of $21.9 million resulted from the dissolution of the European subsidiary. This loss combined with asset impairment charges taken in the fourth quarter totaled $25 million for the quarter and the year. This compares with no impairment charges in the fourth quarter 2008 and $800,000 for the full year 2008. Currency translation and acquisitions increased segment profit $3.9 million in the quarter and reduced segment profit $5.9 million for the year. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group operating profit decreased to 3.9% for the year from 8.2% in 2008. ", "I would now like to comment briefly on our balance sheet items. You will find more balance sheet information on our website under www.sherwin.com Investor Relations press releases. ", "Our total debt on December 31, 2009 was $817.6 million including short-term borrowings of $22.7 million. The increase in long-term debt resulted from the issuance of $500 million in five-year bonds at 3.125%, the second lowest rate paid on five-year notes this year and the 14th lowest in history for an A rated company. In January we entered into a new three-year $500 million credit agreement to be used for general corporate purposes including to finance working capital requirements and to support commercial paper borrowings. This agreement includes a provision to increase the size of the facility subject to the discretion of each lender to participate in such increase up to an aggregate amount of $750 million. The new credit agreement replaces Sherwin-Williams\u2019 $845 million five-year revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire on July 20, 2010. ", "Our cash balance at year-end 2009 was $69.3 million compared to $26.2 million in 2008. Capital expenditures were $27.8 million in the fourth quarter and $91.3 million for the year compared to $117.2 million for the year in 2008. Depreciation expense was $35.6 million in the quarter and $145.2 million for the year. Amortization expense was $6.9 million in the quarter and $25.7 million for the year. ", "In 2010 we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be in a range of $100-115 million. Depreciation will be about $147 million and amortization will be about $26 million. ", "I will conclude this review with two brief comments on the status of our lead litigation. In California the state Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufacturers of lead pigment. Briefing has been completed. Oral arguments should not take place until at least the first quarter of 2010 and most likely not until the second quarter with a decision most likely coming in late 2010. ", "The Gaines case, a single personal injury suit was [tied] to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi beginning in June 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff and the company has filed a Notice of Appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial. Briefing has not yet begun and a decision is not expected until late 2010 or early 2011. ", "That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full-year 2009. I will turn the call over to Christopher Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2010. Chris?", "Christopher Connor ", "", "Thanks Bob. Good morning everybody. Thanks for joining us today. It is hard to be satisfied with the past year when many of the metrics we use to measure our performance were backwards. The culture of our company is one of growth and continuous improvement and that doesn\u2019t change simply because the economy is faltering. ", "If there is a silver lining to this dark cloud it is that our results have showed steady improvement over the course of 2009. We ended on a relatively positive note in the fourth quarter. Our earnings per share, for example, in the first half of this year trailed the first half of 2008 by $0.42 per share. Second half earnings on the other hand this year were $0.17 ahead of last year. I think this positive trend is a function of two noteworthy factors. First, the hard work our people have done all year to manage expenses, improve margins, reduce working capital and minimize our effective tax rate. These efforts have made us a more efficient and profitable company. ", "Second, the moderation in the rate of year-over-year sales declines we experienced in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter. Although we don\u2019t believe our fourth quarter sales results signal a sustainable pickup in end market demand, they do suggest some of the market segments are approaching bottom. ", "Throughout the year we made steady progress in streamlining our supply chain and managing gross margin and SG&A expense. These efforts combined with lower interest expense and a lower effective tax rate resulted in a 110 basis point improvement in fourth quarter net income as a percent of sales and a 10 basis point improvement in full-year net income as a percent of sales. ", "Our cash flow also increased as a percent of sales. For the year we generated $859.2 million in net operating cash, slightly more than 12% of sales. This marks the fourth straight year of cash flow in excess of 10% of net sales. This strong cash flow performance was due in large part to the decrease in year-end working capital. Our working capital ratio improved to 10.7% of sales at year-end from 11.2% at the end of 2008. ", "This has two important ramifications. First, the decrease in working capital requirements increased net operating cash by $136 million and secondly Sean will have to stop insisting that an 11% working capital ratio is optimal. Free cash flow for the year which is operating cash minus capital expenditures and dividends increased more than $9 million to an all-time record high of $603 million as we appropriately pared back our capital expenditures. ", "In the fourth quarter we acquired 4.12 million shares of the company stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 9 million shares for an investment of $530 million. At year-end we have a remaining authorization to acquire another 10.75 million shares. ", "Over the past year we have returned nearly $165 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2009 marked our 31st consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year at our February meeting of the board of directors I will recommend approval of the dividend payout rate for 2010 that will keep our record of consecutive annual dividend increases intact. I base this recommendation on our strong operating cash performance and our commitment to returning cash to shareholders. ", "In 2009 we continued to invest in our control distribution platform opening 53 stores in new markets because we believe new stores drive market penetration and share growth even in a down market. At the same time we consolidated an additional 45 redundant locations for a net increase of eight new stores for the year. Our paint store count in the US, Canada and the Caribbean now stands at 3,354 locations compared to 3,346 a year ago. Our plan for 2010 calls for net new store openings in a range of 20-30 locations. ", "Our Global Group continues to appropriately manage our automotive and OEM product finishes branches, opening 18 new locations and closing 20 for a net reduction of two. We ended the year with 539 branches in operations compared to 541 one year ago. Across all of our divisions in 2009 we recruited 550 high caliber people into our respected management training program and we invested more than $100 million in research, development and commercialization of new product technologies. We are confident these investments will benefit the company in the near-term and deliver appropriate returns in the long-term. ", "Looking ahead to 2010 the steep decline in coatings demand appears to be moderating in some market segments in the US and abroad and we are guardedly optimistic that will continue. However, there are still some end markets, most notably the commercial segment that are likely to continue to deteriorate for the better part of the coming year. Our exposure to these late cycle markets combined with the normal seasonal weakness in first quarter should result in our first quarter consolidated net sales being flat to down slightly compared to the first quarter of 2009. ", "With sales of that level we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter to be in a range of $0.30 to $0.40 per share compared to $0.32 per share earned in the first quarter of 2009. For the full year 2010 we expect net sales will increase in the low to mid single digits versus 2009. With annual sales at that level we estimated diluted net income per common share for 2010 will be in a range of $4.05 to $4.45 per share compared to the $3.78 per share earned in 2009. ", "Again, I would like to thank all of you for joining us this morning and now the team will be happy to take your questions.  ", "Question and Answer Session ", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from the line of PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "You have said in the past the contractor business lagged the DIY business in the recession. That has certainly been true in 2009. As you get into the recovery do you expect this to converge in 2010 or maybe later? ", "Christopher Connor ", "", "Obviously the contractors are much more affected by the new construction in the market both from a residential and non-residential and that has been a big lag on the stores business particularly. Obviously as those new construction markets rebound and approach a more normalized basis that should revert back to its normal process. ", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "Do you think that will happen in 2010 or is it still going to be a slow process for contractors to come back? ", "Christopher Connor ", "", "I think the guidance we are giving would indicate some of it will start to come back. The residential market, case in point, most of the data points we are seeing would indicate that new residential starts should be up this year. The residential re-paint market we think will continue to show some signs of life. That will be offset by the commercial market which we have commented we think will be in for some tough sledding in 2010. ", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup Inc.", "Can you comment on what is happening to the sales trends in your stores in key states such as California, Florida and Vegas? ", "Christopher Connor ", "", "I think Bob gave some direction relative to the performance of our regional. Of note, the Southeastern part of the United States continues to lag the other divisions as it is more impacted by some of the new construction environments. That would be true of California as well. I think we are anxious to see as this year unfolds and predicted rebound in new housing starts should help those segments and that is included in the guidance we are giving for a better year. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan. ", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Your sales came in down six for the quarter and you were expecting down 8-12. What parts of your business performed better than you expected to lead to that above forecast results? ", "Christopher Connor ", "", "Really all three segments had a little better quarter than we had given guidance on as indicated by a little better volumes in each of those segments as well as sales for the them as well. We also had a little bit of help from currency from our foreign operations. ", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Next year in your forecast of low to mid single digit growth, is there a positive pricing variance in there? Is it neutral or is it negative? ", "Sean Hennessy ", "", "Neutral to slightly positive. ", "Jeff Zekauskas - J.P. Morgan", "Your corporate expense in the first quarter bounces all around in that some years it is $40 million and some years it is $20 million. What is it in 2010 in the first quarter?

Assuming the energy costs remain constant at current levels we would expect the petrochemical based raw materials to stabilize at or slightly above the current levels. We are also seeing upward pressure on titanium dioxide largely driven by some capacity rationalization in the industry and we believe some of the titanium dioxide price increases taken in the industry have been successfully implemented in the market.

Secondarily we look internally to see what kind of efficiencies we generate in order to absorb those. Finally we take them to the market in the form of a price increase and I think our history has been one of following that strategy and the courage and discipline to put pricing in when it needs to go in. We have also been very careful not to get out in front of our customers so we don\u2019t prospectively announce price increases over calls like this.

To your second part of the question there are all kinds of levers the company has at its disposal to try and work on that. Don\u2019t forget that last year was an aggressive right-sizing time for the company and then manufacturing facilities were permanently closed and disposed of and channels have moved into more efficient facilities. So that could potentially have a positive impact on margins as well. I think Sean\u2019s got the right approach here. Let\u2019s see how the year starts to unfold. We will give more color on that in the second quarter call and given our history and the importance we pay on margins I think you can expect we will be paying close attention to that number as the year begins.

Clearly this year as reports have come out we have seen CapEx numbers for many of these commercial type applications cut back just as we have at our company and that does have an impact on maintenance. Companies have done a nice job with cash across the United States so to the extent they would feel a little better about getting back on some of their CapEx spending next year that is a possibility. We are more focused, however, on the fact these assets do need to be maintained over time and failure to coat corrosive environment to protect steel and concrete eventually ends up being a much bigger ticket than repairing with paint. We are aware that many of these projects and customers have extended already what we think a normal cycle will be. It is very consistent to the 2001 and 2002 time period where this business segment went through a similar process. There may be a little more of a tail to it but at some point in time we think this will come back.

I think the investors that are buying those homes are certainly not doing so with the expectation of being landlords long-term. When the markets recover and when we start seeing home values move back up I believe a large percentage of them are going to flip those properties for profit. At that point in time when they are really investing in premium upgrades for the properties we should see a benefit. In the meantime in many of these markets they are parking these homes on the rental market and putting minimal cash investment in them. A lot of the pros that are working on these properties are not only doing paint work and paint maintenance work but they are replacing floor covering and doing minimal electrical and plumbing upgrades or bringing them up to code in those regard. Maybe a little landscaping. These are primarily remodelers and handymen that are buying their supplies at one-stop outlets.

Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 44.2% of sales from 43.9% in the first quarter last year.", "Selling general and administrative expenses for the quarter were essentially flat compared to first quarter 2009 at $612.9 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 39.1% in the first quarter this year from 39.3% last year. Interest expense decreased $600,000 compared to first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $8.6 million or 16.8% to $59.5 million.", "Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 45.2% compared to 26.7% in the first quarter of 2009. The first quarter rate this year reflects the one time increase in income tax expense of $11.4 million related to the Health Care And Education Reconciliation Act passed by Congress in March of this year, which raised our effective rate by 19.2% for the quarter.", "For the full year 2010 we expect our effective tax rate would be approximately 35% including the effect of the health care legislation. Last year's rate was 30%. Consolidated net income decreased $4.7 million to $32.6 million from 37.3 million in the first quarter of 2009 due to the health care tax effect. Net income as a percent of sales was 2.1% compared to 2.4% in the first quarter last year.", "Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased to $0.30 per share from $0.32 per share in 2009. The tax impact of the health care legislation reduced diluted net income per common share by $0.10 in the quarter. Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our paint stores group in the first quarter 2010 decreased 5.3% to $850.9 million. Comparable store sales or sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months declined 5.4%. The decrease in sales for the segment was due primarily to a decline in paid sales volume and non-paid sales volume.", "Regionally in the first quarter, our mid-west division led all divisions followed by eastern division, southeastern division and southwestern division. Segment profit for the group decreased 15.6% to $47.8 million in the first quarter 2010 due primarily to lower volume. Segment operating margin decreased to 5.6% from 6.3% in the first quarter last year due primarily to lower volume and raw material cost increases that were partially offset by reductions in SG&A.", "Turning to our consumer group, sales in the first quarter increased 1.4% to $292.1 million. The increase was due primarily to new product introductions partially offset by soft DIY demand at some retail customers. Segment profit for the consumer group increased 24% in the quarter to $37.5 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 12.8% from 10.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued stringent expense control and cost reductions related to facility closings completed during the past year that were partially offset by raw material cost increases and reduced fix cost absorption from lower manufacturing and distribution volume.", "For our global finishes group, sales in US dollars increased 16.2% to $421.1 million in the quarter due primarily to higher paid sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, favorable currency translation rate changes increased net sales for the group by 10.3%. First quarter segment profit increased 333% to $23 million due to higher sales volume and good expense control. Foreign currency rate changes reduced segment profit by $1.1 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 5.5% from 1.5% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and tight expense control that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency rate changes.", "Turning to the balance sheet, our total debt on March 31st 2010 was $1.041 billion including total short term borrowings of $245 million. Total debt on March 31st 2009 was $1.08 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $91.2 million compared to $42.2 million at the end of the first quarter '09. Total borrowings to capitalization were 41% at the end of the quarter versus 40.5% at the end of the first quarter 2009.", "Long term debt to capitalization was 34.7% at the end of the first quarter this year compared to 16.5% last year due to the issuance of $500 million in 3.125% senior notes in December 2009 used to retire short term debt. In the first quarter 2010, the company purchased 400,000 shares of its common stock in the open market. At March 31st 2010 the company had remaining authorization to purchase 10.35 million shares of its common stock. ", "Also in the first quarter 2010 we spent $25.4 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $33.1 million and amortization expense was $6.7 million. For the full year 2010, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year would be approximately 100 to $115 million. Depreciation will be about $147 million and amortization would be approximately $26 million.", "I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with the brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In California, the state Supreme Court will decide whether it is permissible for cities and counties to retain contingency fee counsel to aid them in their suit against former manufactures of lead pigment. Briefing in this case is completed, oral arguments is now scheduled from May 5th, 2010 with a decision most likely coming in the summer of 2010.", "In the Games [ph] case, a single plaintiff personal injury suit was tried to a jury in Jefferson County, Mississippi beginning in June of 2009. The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff. The company has filed a notice of appeal with the Mississippi Supreme Court as we believe a number of significant errors were committed during the trial. ", "Briefing has now begun with our opening brief due by May 27th. Further briefing by the parties will continue into the fall. No hearing date has been set yet in that case, a decision is not expected until at least late 2010 or early 2011. That concludes our review of the results for first quarter 2010 so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the second quarter and full year. Chris?", "", "Christopher Connor", "Thank you Bob and good morning everybody, thanks for joining us today. First quarter of 2010 got off to a pretty rough start. Two months into the year, our sales were lagging behind both budget and last year and our profit was tracking well short of plan. Judging by our first quarter guidance we expected a slow start to the year, In January and February, we were tracking in line with that guidance. Then in March, the storm clouds parted both literally and figuratively and the pace of business began to improve. Whether as a result of pent up demand from January and February, seasonably warm March weather, or more fundamental improvement in end market demand in some segments, our sales in March closed the gap from the previous two months and we finished the quarter essentially on budget and on plan. ", "The sales momentum we saw in March was absolutely encouraging and the fact it appears to be carrying over into April is even more encouraging. Not surprisingly, there was considerable disparity in the strength of the March rebounds across market segments, distribution channels and geographies. In North America, for example, the most favorable trends were in the residential and commercial repaint markets, although we did see some improvement in new residential businesses for the first time in many years. DIY sales through our own stores and most of our external retail partners turned positive in March, after very soft months in January and February.", "The rebound in our global finishes group business was more broad based with sales growth across most product lines and in most geographic markets. If there is a downside to the strengthening industry demand, it is that it will likely keep pressure on the raw material supply chain. Cost pressure caused by the current tight supply of propylene, ethylene, acrylic acid, titanium dioxide and other raw materials is not likely to abate until the second half of the year. ", "If you take a look at year over year raw material cost comparison by quarter input cost troughed in the second quarter of last year 2009, then rose steadily through the second half. We believe they are likely to peak in the second quarter of this year and ease somewhat in the second half.", "If this outlook is correct, our most difficult comparisons are likely to be in the second quarter. In our year-end 2009 conference call, we predicted that the coatings industry would experience annualized year over year raw material price inflation in the low to mid single digits in 2010. Given the recent pricing actions by most of the major raw materials suppliers, we now believe a mid to high single digit percent increase is a more realistic expectation. Despite this change, we think we're in good position to continue to improve the profitability of the company. Based on our initial raw material outlook, we took only limited pricing actions in January and February on some of our industrial product lines. In March, we revised our outlook for raw materials and at the same time announced appropriate price increase cross most of our architectural lines, effective April 1st, to help mitigate the mounting cost pressures. Assuming normal implementation of these price increases, combined with our efforts over the past years to reduce manufacturing and distribution cost and increase our productivity, the impact of raw material inflation over the course of the year should be controlled. In the first quarter, we continue to invest in our controlled distribution platform, our paint stores group added several new stores bringing our total store count in the US, Canada and the Caribbean to 3,357 locations compared to 3,339 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for paint stores group to add approximately 40 to 50 new store locations during the year and significantly reduce the rate of redundant store closings. We made further process in our management of working capital, reducing our working capital ratio to 12.4% of sales from 12.8% of sales in the first quarter of last year. Additionally during the quarter, we used the company\u2019s cash to buy back 400,000 shares of our stock and we increased the dividend rate to $0.36 per share from $0.355 per share last year.", "Our balance sheet remains physically sound and capable of financing our planned business operations and growth well into the foreseeable future. Effective April 1st we completed the acquisition at Sayerlack Industrial Wood Coatings from Arch Chemicals. Headquartered in Pianoro, Italy, Sayerlack is one of the largest manufacturer of industrial wood coatings in Europe and a technology leader in polyurethane, water and UV coatings for the joinery, furniture and cabinets industry. The company operates several manufacturing site across Western Europe along with a comprehensive network of sales, technical and distributor representatives, serving clients in Asia and the United States. Net sales for Sayerlack in 2009 were $147 million dollars. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate that our consolidated net sales will increase in percentage terms in the high single digits compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.70 per share compared to $1.35 per share in the second quarter of 2009. For the full year of 2010, we are increasing our sale guidance range to mid to high single percentage growth over 2009 compared to our previous range of up low to mid single digits. With annual sales at this new level, we\u2019ve raised our expectation for diluted net income per common share for 2010 to a range of $4.20 cents to $4.60 cents per share including the unfavorable tax impact of health care legislation compared to $3.78 cents per share earned in 2009. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to a moment to acknowledge the contributions of a valued member of our management team who's participating in his last earnings called today, John Ault, our vice president and corporate controller is retiring after an outstanding 34 year career with the company.", "John usually doesn\u2019t say much on these calls, but for many years he has had a strong voice within the company and with our board of directors. He plays a supporting role in our external communications but internally he\u2019s always taken the lead to ensure the timeliness and integrity of our financial statements, oversee the company's compliance in this ever changing regulatory environment and safeguard our reputation with the financial community. John is humble, good natured and unassuming; he's also smart, meticulous and unflappable, which in this day and age makes him to be a pretty good guy for a CEO and CFO to have around. For the past eight months, John has been grooming one of our up and coming financial executives, Almus Fishen [ph] to assume the responsibilities of corporate controller. As anyone who knows John would expect, he has done a commendable job and now is well prepared for the transition, he has big shoes to fill.", "I want to take this opportunity to thank John on behalf of our company and its shareholders for his many contributions over the past 34 years, John may be leaving us but the influence he's had in this company will benefit our shareholders for years to come. Thanks, John.", "Again at this time, we'd like to thank all of you for joining us and we're happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now be conducting a question and answer session. (Operator instructions) Thank you. Our first questions coming from Kevin McCarthy of BoA/ML.", "Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BoA/ML", "Yes, good morning how are you?", "Christopher Connor", "Good morning Kevin", "Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BoA/ML", "If I look at the comparable stores decline of 5.4% in paint stores, is there a net weather impact in there or not when you consider the storms at the start of the quarter and the rebound that you referenced in March. What is your - what is your feeling there?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes. You know, Kevin, we're pretty consistent about not really pointing to weather as an indicator of any business trends. We commented that March was a much better weather month than previous Marchs and certainly February and January were worse.", "So all in, we would expect that there was very little weather in the first quarter.", "Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BoA/ML", "OK. And then on the price increases would you - would you quantify the magnitude of the increases in the paint store segment and then we net that out, you know I guess on a company wide basis versus the raw material inflation that you referenced, Chris, what is you expectation for gross margin here as the year progresses?", "Christopher Connor", "The price increases, Kevin, that we announce for the architectural businesses through our stores group were in a range of 3-5% depending on costumer segment and product SKU, none of that was in the first quarter and we\u2019re just now beginning to see the effects of that roll out. Our expectations are that the pricing activity is well behaved as they have historically in the past. We would expect to have, you know some significant percentage of that, realized the next couple of quarters. And then over the remainder of the 12 to 18 months to roll this out would probably get up to about 75% implementation. We don't give guidance per line through the course of the year, so there's not a gross margin guidance number that we're giving at this point in time. I think it\u2019s phased into the overall earnings guidance that we're providing.", "Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BoA/ML", "OK. And then final question, if I may, in the consumer segment you referenced some new product introductions. What were the size of those and should we \u2013 should we expect any drop off in the second quarter, you know, following that launch?", "Christopher Connor", "Yeah. Kevin, there was - there was a broad variety of products launched, there were no standouts in terms of major contributors to their volume growth, typically in a year, they'll have introduced a pretty broad range of new products.", " Bob Wells", " ", "So, you shouldn't correspondingly see the drop off of that, these are not huge selling items.", "Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BoA/ML", "Nothing lumpy in there, you know with initial stocking of the channel? OK. Thank you. ", "Christopher Connor", "Thanks Kevin.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from PJ Juvekar of Citigroup.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup", "Yes. Hi. Good morning.", "Christopher Connor", "Good morning PJ.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup", "Chris, you know despite store business remaining weak, you\u2019re adding new stores. Can you tell us where are these stores being added, are these new geographies that you're adding to? ", "Christopher Connor", "Yeah, PJ. The new markets that we will be adding stores in are really broad based across the whole stores platform which would include United State, Canada and the Caribbean. As you know, we've shared with the investment community that we have opportunities in Canada, in the western half of United State for a little bit more rapid expansion, and these new stores are coming in that area as well. And then we also have, every market still has fill-in opportunity, so I think the broad base of store growth throughout the course of this year will be throughout all those geographies.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup", "OK. And you know when contractors come to your stores, they typically have an account and you extend them credit. Are you seeing any credit growth to contractors?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, we are. If you look at our DSO was very good in the first quarter but you can see the absolute dollars of our receivables were also higher so we are seeing activity.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup", "OK. And you know you had talked about a special team focusing on foreclosures and selling paint to the new foreclosed homes. Can you give some update on that activity in that group? Thank you.", "Christopher Connor", "Sure. I think a lot of that effort again is through our stores group and particularly as the new residential market has softened, we've been able to shift some of our resources and direct our sales force and others to focus on calling on those contractors that do more of the residential repaint, which would include some of the foreclosure activity. I think in my comments PJ, I indicated that was one of the strong areas for the company in the quarter and we saw nice lift in that space. So, I think we\u2019re beginning to make progress there. ", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "Thank you.", "Christopher Connor", "Thanks, PJ.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is coming from Dennis McGill, of Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Good morning, everybody. ", "Christopher Connor", "Good morning, Dennis.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Just wanted to ask a couple of questions on market share and your outlook on the revenue side. Realizing within the paint store segment, you have a different exposure to the end-channel than what you might do from some of the other public competitors. So, wondering if, when you think about sort of the recessionary impact of the shift from professional contractor to DIY, are you seeing that trend moderate at all or at least stabilize recently? ", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, it\u2019s real early to make that call that, Dennis. I think we have indicated to the investment community that the updated data points from the end of 2009 were the contractors accounted for 55% of all architectural purchases and the DIY market 45%. That trended down a few more points towards the DIY again in \u201909 from its\u201908 levels. And time will tell whether that\u2019s the trough and it starts to move back up or whether there\u2019s more to come.", "I think our expectations are that given the significant amount of new construction lack in the market place, that\u2019s a pretty normalized expectation of how that volume would shift and if some of that new construction comes back , we would expect to see this trend back up towards its normal 60/40 ratio in favor of the contractor. You know, early sign, and these are very early signs as we indicated in the month of March and into April, the contractor segment as John just commented on receivable numbers really starting to pick up. So, time will tell and we\u2019ll share that number with you at the end of the year when we have it.", "Dennis McGill \u2013 Zelman & Associates", "Is there any way to get a sense on the contractor side if non residential or commercial maintenance is picking up at all? We know that the construction side is going to be down for awhile. But have you been able to piece through from your customers anything happening on the maintenance side of non-res?", "Christopher Connor", "Hopefully, Dennis, and when we talked about the residential repaint and the commercial repaint segments being up in the first quarter, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re talking about.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "And when you think about your guidance, one of the moving variables is obviously the acquisition closing and the benefit you will get from that. Can you maybe talk about just organically how much better you see revenue this year relative to a couple of months ago?", " Bob Wells", "Well, I think, you know for the full year, I will tell you I\u2019d probably do it in reverse instead of going organic. You know what the total guidance is? And if you take a look at the acquisition being an annual 147 million that Chris mentioned, we only have it for the three quarters. ", "So I would say if you\u2019re looking around 115 to 120 will hit our P&L from now to the end of the year. In the third -- in the second quarter, it\u2019s going to be full impact for the quarter. For the year, it\u2019s going to be three quarters versus the full year.", "So, it\u2019ll about 1.5% to 1.7% in the -- for the full year and probably just slightly over 2% for the second quarter. You back that out of our guidance and I will tell you that even the four year where we were at low to mid adding in 1.7, now we are mid to high. So, the organic growth had to be stronger. And I think that pretty good gives you the\u2026", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Okay, great. All right looking forward to seeing you guys in two weeks. ", " Bob Wells", "Thanks, Dennis.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Christopher Conner", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "the first question is, in terms of your share repurchase intentions, your shares have move up nicely and you bought 400,000 shares in the quarter. Have you bought any since the quarter closed and you know, is this like would it be a period where your share repurchase activity falls off? ", "Christopher Conner", "You know Jeff, the only way we can buy stock between the end of the year and prior to when we release earnings and actually three days after we release earnings, we\u2019re locked out. We consider ourselves locked out just like an inside would be because we don\u2019t buy. The only time we do is occasionally. When we think something abnormal is going to occur we will put in 10b5-1 Plan that allows us also to buy through the blackout as a company. So the answer is, during this, we\u2019d adopt [ph] one of those in place, so therefore, no, we haven\u2019t bought any stock between month end and now. I would tell that our stock repurchase when you look at this price, we still think that when we take a look at it, the stock we\u2019ve purchased over the last ten years and prior to that has all been accretive. We think that we buy the stock on a long term basis and I guess I would just say, last year in the first quarter we bought 500,000 shares, this year we bought 400,000, at the end of the year, we had bought 9 million shares, so as produce cash throughout the year, we are going to be looking for acquisitions just like we did last year, and void of acquisitions, we are going to be buying stock but the one thing I would tell you is there is remote chance that we will have cash on our balance sheet at the end of the year, in a greater amount than we do today last year end. ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "That's very clear. Secondly in terms of the increase in your sales guidance for the year, you know, from low to mid to mid to high, you know, could you break that up into acquisition price and volume?", "Bob Wells", "", "I think when you take a look at it, the acquisition will be between 1.5% and 1.7% in both locations and I think price, when it comes to price and volume, I think Chris said it, we do expect a little more price than we did, but we still expect more volume for the year than we did at the last call, but we don\u2019t really have a break up for you.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "It just seems to me that if your average prices are going up three to five or even half of three to five and you've got one to two in acquisitions, then it would seem that your volume expectations would be unchanged insofar as you want to make these calculations consistent, or is it that you're ", "saying that, you know it's mid to high for the year but maybe you can do better than that.", "Bob Wells", "", "I think on the, first of all, on the pricing, let\u2019s remember that it takes us a while to get this in. we are talking about an architectural price increase on the architectural business through stores. The other price increases that we effected January 1 were already baked in. So I think your estimate about what the price impact is going to be in the year is a little high. We have definitely moved our volume expectations up in providing this new guidance.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Okay. And lastly, were your prices on average up for the quarter or down or flat?", "Bob Wells", "", "Up slightly. As Chris mentioned, we did raise prices on January 1 on some products, but when you take a look at it, very little.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Thank you very much.", "Bob Wells", "", "Thank you, Jeff.", "", "Operator", "", "Sergey Vasnetsov of Barclays Capital.", "Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital", "", "Good morning.", "Christopher Conner", "", "Good morning, Sergey. ", "Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital", "A lot of questions have been asked already, what's your view on acquisitions ex the US and specifically in China?", "Christopher Conner", "", "We don\u2019t comment on any prospective deals that we may be working on. I think we have shared with the investment community that we have an appetite for expanding our industrial products, primarily outside of North America. That would include Asia Pacific. I would remind the investors that the Sayerlack acquisition that we just completed in the industrial wood finishes complements the Inchem acquisition we made about a year and a half ago in Asia which was an industrial wood finishing product. And to the extent that there are more bolt ons in that part of the world, we would be interested in them.", "Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital", "What's your current view on the US commercial real estate market?", "Christopher Conner", "Not good. New construction has essential come to a standstill. We don\u2019t think there is a major mall under construction anywhere in the United States. Occupancy rates are not good either which limits the tenant improvement and buildout types of expenditures that we would see, and I think the guidance that we have been giving throughout the last three or four quarters has been that the declining commercial market that we saw last year I think was often the high 40% and is likely to taken another turn down in 2010. So all the guidance we are giving is predicated on a very soft commercial market for this year, both new and repaint.", "Sergey Vasnetsov - Barclays Capital", "Okay, thank you.", "Christopher Conner", "Thank Sergey.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "", "Good morning, everyone.", "Christopher Conner", "Good morning, Chuck.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "And best of luck to John Ault as he retires from Sherwin. In looking at your working capital, Sean, do you think you are going to continue to be able to manage that number down, that ratio down as business improves? Or when do we -- another way to ask it, when do we expect it to start absorbing a little bit of cash?", "Sean Hennessy", "You know, we expect that over the next two quarters of absorbed cash, I would say that it will be a use of cash in the fourth quarter, but not as great as it has for the full year, we've still expect it to be slightly use of cash.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right, thank you. Chris, in looking at some of your industrial and OEM end markets, can you give us a little detail on those? ", "Christopher Conner", "Yes, I think on the OEM side, Chuck, that\u2019s looking at a little bit better. We saw a little life in that business in the first quarter, and the prospects in meeting with these customers, is they're feeling much better about the coming year. ", "The protective and marine which you know, fit some of the industrial markets for us as well also saw a little bit of a life on the repaint cycle, so those markets where people are required to maintain properties as we've talked about in the past has got an infinite ability to put that off, so that's coming back a little bit as well. ", "The new component on the industrial commercial side, we just talked, with Sergey\u2019s comments are hurting that business a little bit. So, all in I'd say both the protective and marine on the OEM finishes are looking little better to us now than they were say three, four months ago.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "And then finally, while you talked about opening 40 to 50 news paint stores this year, what's the net number that you're looking at through the year, is it any better? I don't know if you disclose what the closures are going to be at the fourth quarter call but sort of what are you looking for in fiscal 2010?", "Christopher Conner", "There's going to be a dozen closures, plus or minus, maybe a little higher than that number so the net should somewhere in the 30 to 45 range, you know. It's a hard number to peg when you're closing stores because you got lease issues to get through as well, but I think that's pretty much where we are going to end up.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right, thank you, Great quarter.", "Christopher Conner", "Thanks, Chuck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Don Carson of UBS.", "Don Carson - UBS", "Yes, thank you. ", "Christopher Connor", "Good morning, Don.", "Don Carson - UBS", "Good morning. Just had a question just on your view on the overall mark, you are more positive on volumes now, I know you've talked in the past I think that you have a small rebound in US architectural volumes this year, do you think you could get up to 600 million gallons? ", "And you know, as commercial, you know, still a drag this year, but you see it contributing to positive next year, what do you now think of these normalize volumes for the US architectural market and do we get there in 2011 or that\u2019s still more of a 2012 event?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, Don, I think the 600 million gallons for the year might be a tad aggressive from what we're thinking right now. As you know the year ended at 550 and a few, and a normalized year would be 1 to 2% gallon increase, so if we run at a 3% to 4% or even a 5% gallon increase, that would be a nice rebound, that would take us about halfway from 550 to 600, so that number seems a little bit of a stretch to get there.", "And don't forget that, you know, when we're having a normalized year of 1 to 2%, that's what the commercial new construction market behaving normally which is not, so have some head's win on that, I think the rebound and the repaint cycles will left it, higher than the normal run rate, and the 600 seems a little bit of a far outreach at this point.", "Don Carson - UBS", "And how about next year as you know, as we get -- when I say normalized, it is not the increase but sort of it, you know, we get back to more normal levels of demand?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, I think the market has got to run at a higher rate for a couple of years, just to get back on normal footings, so if we ran at 3 to 4% gallon growth this year. I think we could expect to do that again, and you know, 11 and maybe even if it's 12 or 13, and you know the housing market needs to come back up to north of a million new starts to sustain what our country will need.", "Commercial construction won't stay down forever like it is today. So I think it's a couple of good years here that we could be heading into.", "Don Carson - UBS", "And a question on operating leverage, you know, with you new lower cost structure, what should we think of the EPS benefit of each 1 percentage point increase in volumes?", "Christopher Connor", "You know, Don, we don't really share that, but I would just probably guide you to take a look of what happened between 2002 and 2007. And in the short term we actually think the flow through and the EPS growth would be slightly higher than what we're able to do in that time period.", "Don Carson - UBS", "Ok, thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Good morning, gentlemen. I'd just like to follow up on your better or higher expectations in terms of revenue guidance, volume guidance excluding the acquisitions, you know. You are looking at about a 1% growth, a little bit over 1% in the consumer business, and you actually saw mid single digit decline in the store business, you mentioned that weather was pretty much odd, it seems there was a lot of catch up in March that happened.", "Is it the trends that you are seeing coming out of March and April, that you think will be sustainable going forward that gives you confidence to expect -- to actually raise your volume expectations going forward, and your earnings increase expectations. Is that also driven entirely by volume?", "Christopher Connor", "Dmitry, on the sales number, the two factors that are causing us to raise is, the first, we haven't talk much about this yet on the call is our global group, which really had a terrific quarter for us, and given the visibility we have into those businesses going forward, and we significantly raised our expectations of that teams ability to deliver improved revenue. Likewise on the stores, and we just reported as you pointed out a 5% decline but the comparisons eased for this group and we are starting to see contractors ramping up and the businesses that we are bidding on and providing coatings for at this moment, we have taken a significant \u2013 not a significant, we have taken a tick up in our expectations of what\u2019s going to come out of the stores business.", "Turning to the earnings number, Sean, maybe you want to comment on that?", "Sean Hennessy", "", "And I guess I will just go back to the prior question, when we look at the flow through percentages and what we have been able to do over the years and then plus what we did to our company to right size the company like closing facilities and closing stores, when you look at the incremental gallons that Chris just mentioned, we feel we are going to do a nice job of bringing those to the bottom line.", "Dmitry Silverstein - Longbow Research", "I mean certainly if you can continue to manage doing what you are doing in the consumer group, where your revenues were up what about $4 million and your profit was up $7 million, that's a pretty good leverage. On the global group, just to get a little bit better -- is that the portion of (inaudible) better or is it the Marine and maintenance portion of the business that are doing better?", "Bob Wells", "All those segments were better. I would say the real driver was the architectural businesses throughout Latin America.", "Dmitry Silverstein - Longbow Research", "", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Christopher Conner", "Thanks, Dmitry.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from John Roberts of Buckingham Research.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "", "Good morning, guys.", "Christopher Conner", "Good morning, John.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research", "Do you think the new store openings will accelerate? You're opening roughly the same number as last year which is a low level. The closings are just simply rolling off, aren't they, because you haven't made any major acquisitions of store chains in a while?", "Christopher Conner", "That\u2019s correct, John. These are still some of the acquired stores from the earlier part of the last decade that we are getting to and the reason, the tail on that is that a number of these locations require in their lease language that we are not allowed to close during the term of a lease. So as the leases expire, we are able to get out of these last few stores. And I don\u2019t think there is a lot of upside to the gross store number that we are talking about, it takes a period of time to negotiate real estate locations, then the permitting, and build out et cetera, we\u2019ve got a pretty good visibility into what that number is going to be by year end. I think our expectations are that for the year that\u2019s the right number and we will probably be ramping up slightly into the 11 and 12 period as the market continues to rebound.", "", "John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research", "And secondly I think it used to be that 90% of paint demand was, paint on paint right just for repainting and maintenance activities and the new construction part just got to be a bigger part and obviously got much more volatile. Is the turnaround, can it just simply be characterized as new construction parts now got small enough again so that maintenance is taken over as a driver?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, that's clearly we're looking at in this environment right now, John. We think actually new construction has shrunk below kind of a more sustainable historic run rate, it\u2019s typically in the 15% range. It actually got north of 20 and up into the mid 20s and now we think it's running about 10 to 11. So we\u2019re probably below where we ought to be but clearly repaint becomes a bigger portion of the market and that would be the driver for this year.", "John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research", "Thank you", "Bob Wells", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard \u2013of Cleveland Research.", "Sean Hennessy", "Good morning. Eric", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "In terms of the stores business, I think the margins expanded in the second half of last year, was down double digit comps, and in the first quarter the margins were actually down, less worse comps, can you help explain if there\u2019s anything to learn or understand better in terms of why the margins got a little bit worse while the sales got a little bit better in the stores business. ", "Sean Hennessy", "The only thing is that really we\u2019re closer to the breakeven Eric. Years ago when we had sales \u2013 at one time, if we go back 15 years, that started to have negative margins in the first quarter, and we used to lose money in the first quarter. And as the sales continued to grow and we went way past the breakeven point for each quarter we had nice profit in first quarter but with the volume curve that we have, even with the negative 5.4, which is closer to the breakeven point that we were a year ago, we are well below where we were four years ago.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Secondly, in terms of the 2Q guidance I think you commented that the input costs compares sounds like it is probably the worst in 2Q and the staging of pricing starts in 2Q but obviously grows through the year and so what are the factors that allow you to give guidance for an approximate amount of earnings growth in the second quarter considering the price cost comparison seems like it would be the most difficult in 2Q?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, I think if you noticed we don't give you any type of a range on sales but we did give you a range and with this volume and you know even with the acquisition, with the volume and the amount of price we get there, we have a $0.15 differential range really dealing with mostly the gross margin. So even if we look at what we think could be the low end of the gross margin, we feel we are at the low at the range and so that give us the confidence to put the range out there like we did. ", "Christopher Conner", "I think you are also seeing too, Eric, the leverage that we promised the Street on the back half of all the work to right size the organization. So the plant closings, the distribution center closing, store closings, the head count reduction, all those things are in now and starting to show the kind of benefit that we had anticipated.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Historically, it\u2019s taken you maybe a year to offset higher cost with selling price increase stabilized gross margin, is there a reason why that would happen slower or faster at this time?", "Sean Hennessy", "I would tell you that this one I think is going to act pretty much the same as in prior years. You know, the interesting thing is, I would tell you, the one little thing that is little different this time is the staging. I think that used to, we were in all segments and all different product lines, we were pretty consistent or in a very small band when we put them in. Chris did mention we did take some products up January 1, so -- and you know, but most of them April 1. So, will see how that's affects it.", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research Company", "Thank you.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thanks Eric.", "Operator", "Thank you.

", "Steve O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "You mention Latin America, I wondered if you could detail the performance of any of your other international markets.", "", "Christopher Conner", "", "Yes, well, as you know the company does not have a significant non-domestic revenue stream, maybe 15% of our revenues and Latin America accounts for two-thirds of that. Our Chinese business would primarily be servicing the OEM customers, we discussed that on one of the earlier questions, that that business is starting to pick up but again it's a very small base, not a lot to move the needle. We have a small architectural business in India, that too is doing well, so really all, as we said, across segments and geographies in that global group, we are moving in the right direction.", "", "Steve O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "", "And then secondly, what kind of factors give you confidence that raw material pressures will peak at mid year?", "Christopher Conner", " It is, well, a couple of things. Steve. One is a lot of the pressure we are seeing right now is due to tightness of supply and some commodity that we think we understand that the supply is going to get better as we go through the year. So that\u2019s the principle driver. It is talking to our suppliers.", "", "Steve O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons", "", "I just wonder with \u2013 you see a rebound in volume, you know translating into increasing demand for raw materials; I don't know if that will offset some of that.", "", "Christopher Conner", "", "There certainly will be an increase in market volume, as Chris indicated earlier, it's going to be probably very modest, so the pressure would be light.", "", "Steve O'Neil - Hilliard Lyons ", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "", "Christopher Conner", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question coming is from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "", "Yes, Chris, I had a follow up. I was wondering if you could comment on how some of the store brands are doing that you service or supply out of the consumer segment.", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, the quarter for those guys is relatively flat, we made the comment that the number of retailers you know, it's kind of a mixed bag. Some are doing okay, some are struggling a little bit. You know, the architectural paint brands in that group obviously are the largest ones and kind of track right in line with the performance for the group. Our Thompson and Minwax brands don't tend to be heavy first quarter products anyway, so we will see how they start to unfold in the second quarter. Bob was clarifying our comments relative to some new product placements and a lot of a non-paint brands like our putty brushes and spray-ons [ph] saw some nice placements of some new SKUs. So overall they are doing about the same and slightly better and we will see how the year unfolds.", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "I guess Chris what I was getting at, are the store brands doing better than say the Dutch Boyo or the\u2026 ", "Christopher Connor", "", "For the private label that we do for them?", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Yes.", "Christopher Connor", "I don't think there is any significant change in those sales patterns.", "", "Chuck Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Thanks.", "Mike Sison \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "", "Chris, can you talk to your contractors, are they feeling any better these days in the US? Has their sentiment improved and maybe to some degree do you have any sense they are hiring?", "", "Christopher Connor", "Yes and yes, there's a lot more activity that they are seeing relative to the last couple of years and I would think that quite a number of them are starting to bring on you know part time and casual labor to help round out their repaint businesses.", "Mike Sison \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Great. And when you take a look at the rebound in March, any sense of how much of that was maybe just restocking and is that going to continue into April and May?", "Christopher Connor", "We get very little impact on March through restocking whether, you know, the costumer segment through our stores doesn't stock. So that's not a factor there. And the retailing partners that we are privilege to do business with, they are all pretty savvy operators and keep those inventory levels at the appropriate amounts and expect us to be the backstop so they don\u2019t have to \u201crestock.\u201d I don\u2019t think any of the March lift was on restocking.", "Mike Sison \u2013 Keybanc Markets", "Great. And final question, when you take a look at the commercial markets, maybe a historical perspective or your thoughts going forward, you know, what do you need to see to see that part of your business stabilize and does there tend to be some inflection points where you see that side of the business rebound?", "Christopher Connor", "", "Yes, Mike. The principal drivers that we watch are occupancy rates and specifically retail and office space occupancy rates which declined to almost an all time low in 2009 and in some segments and at particularly apartment buildings it\u2019s starting to rise now and most of the forecast say that all three of those categories, apartment, office and retail, should rise some by the end of the year, but they have got a long ways to come back before you are going to see any meaningful building.

Chris, you mentioned you had to take a number of special actions, given poor service levels from some vendors.  What was the accurate cost to Sherwin from those special actions?  And perhaps you could comment more broadly on your raw material cost inflation expectations for 2010 versus \u201809, given the TIO2 in acrylic pressure that you referenced.", "Chris Connor", "Okay, I\u2019d be happy to do that. Kevin.  First of all, regarding the cost, we haven\u2019t disclosed that.  We indicated that our margins were backwards about 60 basis points, most of that was relative to the cost associated with these actions.  In terms of our outlook for the year, Bob, you may want to comment on what we\u2019re guiding at this point.", "Bob Wells", "Yeah, Kevin.  We think that for the industry, the whole raw material basket for paint and coatings is probably up mid-single digits.  By year end we expect that to push maybe a little higher to the mid-to-high single range for full year. ", "Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BoA/ML", "And did the constraints restrain your sales volumes across any product lines through the company?", "Chris Connor", "I think there\u2019s been some indication regarding some shortages in particular products.  I think there\u2019s been some comments regarding the traffic-marking paint industry, as one case in point where there\u2019s been some shortages.  For the most part, our higher-demand, architectural paint products have remained in stock.  And through the actions that we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve been able to keep our customers in business. So, very well a constraint at that end of the scale. ", "Kevin McCarthy \u2013 BoA/ML", "And, final question if I may.  What is your outlook for pricing in companies stores for the back half of the year, please.", "Chris Connor", "And here again, Kevin, we\u2019ve been very consistent about our pricing philosophy here at the company.  When facing raw material pressures, just as a reminder for the entire audience, we first pushed back against the supplier, secondarily looked internally to see what efficiencies we could gain and finally, take pricing to the market as the last resort. ", "We\u2019ve been very open with the investing community group regarding those pricing actions, after we\u2019ve announced them to our customers, in terms of timing and percentage.

Why so high?  Is that correct?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, I think that \u2013 when you look at that forecast, we\u2019re looking at different things with our fixed assets and what we think is happening with amortization, but you\u2019re right, that\u2019s probably at the high end of where we\u2019ll be.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "Right.  And what was the tax rate on the debt charge?", "Chris Connor", "37%", "", "Jeff Zekauskas", "", "Okay.  Then lastly, if you compare your over-year volumes in April, May, and June versus the previous year, what was the variance?  I mean, my general impression for coatings is that April was tremendously strong, and so it was a little bit weaker in May, and a little bit weaker in June. Is that correct, and what\u2019s your impression of the reason for the change?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, I think that would be fairly accurate to what we\u2019re seeing in the industry. Jeff  As all of us are aware, the first-time home-buyer tax credit expired in April.  I think that drove a lot of energy in our particular segment.  As that passed through, we saw lower housing numbers come out, as an example.  Another retailer is commenting about it slowing in the quarter from the beginning to the end.  I think that was clear with our numbers as well.", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay.  Thanks very much.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I missed the CapEx number you gave in the guidance for the year.", "Sean Hennesy", "One-hundred and fifteen.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay.  And then, when we look at the interplay between volume, growth in the quarter, the gross margin decline and the SG&A ratio decline, could you talk about what was going on there, including benefits [inaudible], leverage, and some of the cost reductions you\u2019ve taken over the past 18 to 24 months.", "Sean Hennesy", "I think the gross margin is, as you indicated when we take a look at the kind of benefits we\u2019ve had from taking the right size of our footprints, I think we\u2019re down 6/10ths of our gross margin.  But [inaudible], when you take a look at the [inaudible] selling price, and the whole mixture, we feel pretty good about how our conversion cost came in. ", "And the SG&A in the Second Quarter was up, right around $38 million, but we did have the acquisition in there.  And without the acquisition we feel pretty good because our SG&A grew last time half of what our sales rate did.  So when you take a look at it, our SG&A was down 1.2%, and I think that\u2019s really what the strength shows, the strength of the leverage when we get a 10% sales gain that we can drive that PBT up 21%.", "Chuck Cerankosky \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Sean, how does the volume growth help the cost of goods line? Obviously, you had the cost pressure, but can you get into it a little bit with the volume.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yeah, you know, we\u2019ve always said that the incremental volume really helps the consumer and when you look at the consumer group operating margins, which were up tremendously, were up fairly strong in the Second Quarter and year-to-date.  With the plants running at full capacity that helps us. ", "We\u2019ve never gotten into the metric of what our conversation cost is on an incremental gallon, but if you can think about that incremental gallon, the gross profit over 40%.  And you know \u2013 when you take a look at it, the incremental cost of SG&A and admin, especially in admin is basically zero. Those incremental gallons really slow down to the bottom line.

Chris, I think the last quarter you talked about maybe the clouds are starting to lift a little bit, now you\u2019ve talked about deceleration here in May and June, do you think that\u2019s directly contributed to the tax issues, or something broader that might extend that bit of Malaysia or lul if you will into the second half?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, Bob. Obviously, while that was a piece of it, I don\u2019t think that explains the entire slowing and.  We\u2019ve commented about the skittish consumer in this economy that any little bit of bad news tends to see some bit of a pull back in some of it\u2019s discretionary spending.  ", "We had commented at the beginning of the year about the increasing headwind that we\u2019re going to face on the new construction, and not residential businesses, and those are continuing.  I think that new housing numbers came out and they\u2019ve been adjusted down a little bit as well too. So there\u2019s a broader base slowing we see, to the demand for end products here in the United States, across a lot of segments.", "Robert Court \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "How will you adjust it with all your plans for store count next year as these trends play out.", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, we\u2019ve always taken a long-term view of that, Bob.  We\u2019ve talked repeatedly to the investing community that our next short-term horizon goal, which is to get 4,000 paint stores in North America. ", "We\u2019re on a continuous path to do that.  The 40 to 50 net new stores, 40 to 50 gross new stores we\u2019re planning for this year has been the low end of our range.   I don\u2019t see us dropping below the low end of that for next year, and as the economy improve, we\u2019ll probably ramp back up to our more normalized run rate of about 100 new stores per year.", "Robert Court \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "And one last one, I appreciate your time.  Was there a difference in the typical approach to pricing, timing of price increases this year, or was 2010 a normal sequence in terms of when you institute those prices.", "Chris Connor", "Absolutely normal in terms of the sequence of the process we go through, the only abnormal part of that was that we raised them April 1 for architectural businesses as opposed to the beginning the year. And the reason was because we were following the very disciplines approach we take here, which is to make sure we have clear visibility and the cost, that we\u2019ve done everything we can mitigate it. We didn\u2019t see that late in the Fourth Quarter of last year which took a path in the First Quarter pricing.  By the time the First Quarter stiffened, we realized we needed to go out.  So that was very much the processes that we went through to get this earlier price increase announced, and all future price increases will follow the same mind set.", "Robert Court \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, thank you very much.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from John Roberts with Buckingham Research ", "John Roberts \u2013 Buckingham Research", "", "It looked like you had queued a several-cents dilution in the quarter from the recent acquisitions.  How does that change over the rest of the year? ", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, I think when we take a look at it for the full year, we said that it would be slightly dilutive.  I think you could see the dilution in the second quarter.  I would say that we\u2019re going to be relatively flat for the acquisitions in the third and fourth quarter.

We\u2019re seeing improvement, although catching up in the middle of the paint season is a difficult thing to accomplish.  So we think we\u2019re going to feel the tightness for the remainder of the year, probably catching up significantly back to normal run-rates in the fourth quarter, or really first quarter of next year.  The point that there will still be some tightness in the third quarter, the company will continue to take the remedial actions that we\u2019ve been taking to maintain service to our customers.

These are excellent business people who have sophisticated programs and systems in place to keep inventory at appropriate levels.  I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any overstocking or destocking that\u2019s been occurring.  I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty much as it should be at this point in time.

We have indicated that we continue to have an interest in using cash for appropriate acquisitions where we can strengthen our control distribution architectural store model, both domestically and around the world as well as building out our industrial coatings service capabilities.

And as you also know, our focus, primary customer segment is through the professional painting contractor.  I think the improving trends that we\u2019re seeing are the result of the contractor cutting back a little bit this year.  We see them hiring painters and lining us more work.  Their schedules are more robust than they have been.  The residential repaint market is, as we indicated at the beginning of the year, would be the driver for this group to share and that\u2019s proving to be the case as the year\u2019s unfolding.  So the extent that we remain focused on the contractor, we\u2019re enjoying a little bit of a bounce back on that business this year.

", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. ", "Chris Connor", "", "Off industry numbers.  We think that new construction in total in the US in terms of architectural volume is down probably in the low teen now.  So it\u2019s 12%-13% of total-gallon volume goes to new construction and that\u2019s roughly half and half non-residential and residential.  Residential may be a little bit higher than non residential.  ", "In the repaint market, you know, the other 87%-88%, residential is probably 70% of that non-residential 30%.  Relative to the market, we\u2019d probably skew a little heavier towards new construction and a little heavier towards non-residential. ", "PJ Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you.  That\u2019s helpful.  And secondly, you know, you talked about price growth of average of about 2%.  Is it fair to say that maybe consumer channel is kind of flat and maybe stores pick it up 5% and it averages out to 2%?  Is that in the ballpark? ", "Chris Connor", "", "Yeah.  You know, that\u2019s why a lot of times we never have tried to give you a total because when consumer, they have aerosol cans, they have F-style cans, brushes, rollers, and so forth.  So that\u2019s a tough one to give to you.  That\u2019s why we\u2019ve never gone to the full \u2013 but in general, I would say that the price increases that the stores groups typically goes in faster and are more effective earlier than we realized in the consumer group.  Since we went out April 1st, that\u2019s probably still true to this day also.

We are looking for the leads to come primarily in the latexes.  That\u2019s where a lot of the tightness has been and some of the additives that come off of that chemical change.

And then secondly here, if raw material costs stay constant, do you have enough in the way of price increases already out there on a go-forward basis to offset that?

I think we\u2019ve been doing that for the last two years now.  And we\u2019ve had different things, and instead of just \u2013 we call it a standard lease, I think we\u2019ve looked for different aspects of a contract and lease language that we can get that can help us for long term.  Sometimes that\u2019s longer, that\u2019s more options.  Sometimes that\u2019s options at a lower price, or renewing an option at a lower price than what was in the lease.

I don\u2019t want to know anything about any future price increases, but just to fully understand, you did April 1st with a price increase.  You saw just over 2% in this quarter.

The market shift between DIY and Pro, and then within your own business how you think you\u2019re doing in DIY.

And we do expect, as Bob just answered in an earlier comment, that when the year is said and done, the new residential construction market will be slightly positive for the year.  So we\u2019re going to start to see a little rebound in those areas.

We think the 60/40 range that it\u2019s been bounding around in the last couple of years is probably a pretty reliable number to count on going forward, and it should strengthen as new construction comes back, certainly in the coming years on the commercial side as well.  ", "Regarding our own DIY performance, I think we\u2019ve been pleased.  You see the numbers on our consumer segment this quarter, which have a lot of DIY presence there, so that\u2019s been strong for them as well as the DIY performance at our own stores.

", "Steve O\u2019Neil \u2013 Hilliard Lyons", "", "Good morning.  My questions have been answered.  Thank you. ", "David Mackey", "", "Thanks, Steve. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Ivy Zoman of Zoman & Associates. ", "Ivy Zoman [Scott] \u2013 Zoman & Associates", "", "This is Scott, I\u2019m in for Ivy.  I just have a quick question.  Last quarter you guys spoke about benefit from targeting contractors going after foreclosed homes.  I was wondering if you could give an update on that and the incremental change you saw this quarter? ", "Chris Connor", "", "Scott, I think our comments in the past has been that the nature of the pro doing the work on foreclosed homes, the foreclosed homes that are being purchased by investors probably benefits the multiline warehouse home center more than the specialty paint store because their needs for materials are much broader than the assortment offered by a specialty paint store.", "That doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s no professional painting contractors working on those properties, it\u2019s just that generally the contractor working on those properties also does some floor coverings, some electrical, some plumbing, etcetera.  ", "So we think that that channel has probably seen the benefit disproportionate to the paint store\u2019s channel.  ", "Ivy Zoman [Scott] \u2013 Zoman & Associates", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research. ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "", "Good morning.  ", "Chris Connor", "", "Good morning, Eric. ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "", "A couple of questions.  First of all, Bob, I think you commented that the input cost inflation for the industry, I thought you said was mid-single digits in the second quarter and it would be higher by the end of the year.  Can you just explain what the input cost year over year was for the industry in the second quarter.  And what the expectation is that that would look like in the second half, if you can do it that way? ", "Bob Well ", "", "Well, it\u2019s a timing issue, Eric.  The input costs rolls through the second quarter.  So on average, if you start out at the beginning of the second quarter, most of these raw materials categories were lower than they were by the end of the second quarter.  ", "So we saw them rise through the second quarter, and you know, where they plateau is hard to predict.  Even if they stayed at the level they are now, you\u2019d be in the mid-to-upper single-digit range.  Does that make sense? ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "Yeah.  I guess more directly, the input cost inflation will be greater in the second half than it was in the second quarter.  Is that right? ", "Bob Wells", "", "The answer to that is yes.  And when you sit there and take a look at year over year though, because the [inaudible] were at the low point in the second quarter of 2009 on a year-over-year basis.  The second quarter was hard. ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "Great.  That\u2019s helpful.  Secondly, in terms of the momentum of sales, if you can just talk about the excluding currency, excluding acquisitions, what that number was again for the second quarter and what the expectations is that that number will look like in the second half so we can just see the underlying business excluding these other things?  ", "Bob Wells", "", "I think when you take a look at it, what we said in our guidance last quarter was that the acquisitions would be about [inaudible] and then the second, and third, and fourth quarter, but only 1 \u00bd for the full year because we had only three months, or three quarters against four quarters.  So acquisition came in at 1.9% of our increase.  And we still think, in the guidance, we have around 2% for the acquisition. ", "We have not put the next acquisition into the guidance yet.  We\u2019re waiting to see \u2013 it\u2019s hard for us to forecast when that will close.  When we look at the currency, we have very little currency in the second half of the year.  When you take a look at the [inaudible] or the Mexican Paso, really the currencies that drive us, when you start looking at that third quarter and fourth quarter, we think that the currency is going to be relatively flat.  ", "So when we give our guidance, I would say less than 2/10ths of a percent will be currency in 2% each quarter, but 1 \u00bd of those for a full year will be for acquisitions.  ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "Great.  And then lastly from a tax rate, I think you had talked about mid-30s coming out of the last quarter was a little bit lower.  Apparently some of that may have been influenced by the charge or not.  Can you update us on what the tax rate assumption should be? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Yeah.  When you take a look at it, you know, we had some discreet items that hit us in the second quarter.  It\u2019s hard to really predict when discreet items will hit.  But when we take a look at our full-year forecast, we think, you know, last quarter we think we were talking about the low-to-mid 30s for that tax rate.  ", "We think probably for the full year, the tax rate will be back in that 33% range.  ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "And then lastly, within the slightly softer second half growth versus the second quarter, can you just specifically talk about where you\u2019re seeing or expecting that difference to be as adjusted new residential due to the expiration of the tax credit?  Or can you talk about what else you\u2019re seeing? ", "Bob Wells", "", "I don\u2019t know that we have any specific in-market segments, Eric, it\u2019s more prominent than others.  Obviously the commercial markets as we\u2019ve talked about are still lagging and facing a lot of headwind.  ", "And I think there\u2019s just been a little bit of a slowdown in some demand in the residential markets.  Guidance in the mid-to-upper single-digits range is still robust given the last four-year track record we\u2019ve been on.  And with that number, Sean just went through them.  I mean, while we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a slowdown here, we\u2019re still fairly bullish on this revenue stream. ", "Eric Bosshard \u2013 Cleveland Research", "Great.  Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "", "Hi.  Just a few quick followups.  How much did you spend to repurchase your shares in the quarter? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Well, let\u2019s see, the average price was $76.48, and so $73.00 year to date, and I just had it here because I pulled it out for that.  Give me ten seconds here and I\u2019ll find it.  Sorry it\u2019s taking me so long. ", "We spent $149.7 million in the second quarter; $76.78.  Year to date we\u2019ve bought 2.35 and at $74.68.  ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "Okay.  Did you by any shares in June? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Yes, we did. ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "In the consumer business you were up roughly 12% for the quarter versus up a percent in the first quarter.  And I know April volumes were really strong, so I take it that that\u2019s an unrepresented number going forward.  So should we expect that to diminish? ", "And likewise in stores, given that probably there was a real bump up in April, I mean, are the growth rates in those two businesses for the next couple of quarters likely to be lower than what they were in the second quarter, all things being equal? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Yeah.  I think when you take a look at it, when we came out with our guidance for the second quarter, we said high single digits.  We didn\u2019t give a range.  And now when you look at the third quarter, we\u2019re saying mid-to-high and we still the acquisition in there.  And for the full year, we\u2019ve stayed the same.  ", "So I think that, you know, it\u2019s pretty easy to assume that different segments are going to be not as high because of the high single digits versus the mid.  ", "Chris Connor", "I think on the consumer specifically, Jeff, you\u2019re a real wordsmith.  You saw on Bob\u2019s comments here that we talked about the segments retail, industrial and institutional customers.  And this is a part of business we don\u2019t talk a lot about, but on this segment we have a significant product line of aerosols and coatings that we sell into other types of distribution channels beyond the typical retail partners.  And it was in that space that we saw some really unique and strong performance in the quarter.  ", "And I think your comment about is this sustainable, this is probably more of a blood [inaudible] and consumer segment will probably come back down in the single-digit range going forward.  ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "Was there not sequential volume growth in global? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Slightly.  But you have to remember, Latin America is in there and they\u2019re going through winter right now.  So they have the opposite.  So when you take a look at the different segments, it was higher.  But when you look at sequential because of going into winter, the Latin America group in that global group did not have any. ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "What was your cash flow from operations in the quarter? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Cash flow for operations in the quarter.  Hang on one second.  I\u2019ll pull that out.  I don\u2019t have that.  ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "Okay. ", "Bob Wells", "", "Well have to get back with you on that, Jeff. ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "Okay.  And lastly, does your sales guidance for the year include Becker? ", "Bob Wells", "", "No. ", "Jeff Zekauskas \u2013 JP Morgan ", "It does not.  Okay.  Great.  Thank you very much. ", "Bob Wells", "", "Thank you, Jeff. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Saul Ludwick of Northcoast Research. ", "Saul Ludwick \u2013 Northcoast Research", "", "A couple quickies.  The interest number, how much did that include?  I mean, that is where you took the hit for the debt repurchase.  How much was that?  ", "Bob Wells", "", "That was just about $15 million, Saul.  ", "Saul Ludwick \u2013 Northcoast Research", "And so interest expense going forward is going to be $11.5 million? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Yes.  I would say that, yeah, you\u2019re looking at, without it, it would be about flat to where we were this quarter.", "Saul Ludwick \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay.  And is there any inclusion in your guidance, Sean, for asset impairment, goodwill?  I mean, last year in the fourth quarter you had a big chunk in the stores, there was a big chunk in global group.  Does your guidance include recurrence of those either asset impairment, goodwill write offs?  You know, things that are not of an operating nature, but hit the income statements? ", "Sean Hennessy", "", "Yeah.  Not a material number. ", "Saul Ludwick \u2013 Northcoast Research", "But some? ", "Sean Hennessy ", "", "Yeah.  But I mean, [inaudible].  There\u2019s always some [inaudible] number with the way we value the goodwill and we have goodwill from many, many acquisitions and so forth.  But it\u2019s going to be deminimious.  ", "Saul Ludwick \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay.  And then this is a trivial question, but you know, in the first quarter you had $110 million diluted shares, and in the second quarter you had almost $110 million.  But the six-month diluted shares was less than either the first quarter or the second quarter.  ", "Sean Hennessy", "", "I\u2019ll have to get back to ou on that, Saul.  I don\u2019t have the calculation in here with me.  ", "Saul Ludwick \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay.  Very good.  Thank you very much. ", "Sean Hennessy ", "", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from Amy Zang of Goldman Sachs", "Amy Zang -  Goldman Sachs", "", "Thanks, guys.  Can you hear me now? ", "Chris Connor", "", "Yep. ", "Amy Zang -  Goldman Sachs", "Two quick follow-up questions.  The first one is the consumer segments, obviously.  You mentioned several times you delivered very strong results in the quarter.  But one of your major competitors in the retail channel reported the month less robust in trends last week.  ", "So I\u2019m just wondering what contributed to your volume of performance relative to competitors in that channel.  Is that because some market-share wins, or some new contracts, or something like that? ", "Chris Connor", "", "Amy, I think, again, the significant less in the quarter for our consumer segment was more on the segments industrial and institutions business.  Our retail traditional business in that segment probably performed close to market, maybe slightly better. ", "Amy Zang -  Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  And the a follow-up question in consumer business.  I know on April 1st, you guys roll out price hikes across the paint stores, and I\u2019m wondering, did you take any actions on the consumer segment as well by implementing price hikes? ", "Bob Wells", "", "We announced a price increase to our architectural businesses across all channels, with consumer and storage groups.  So absolutely. ", "Amy Zang -  Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  So if you [inaudible] from the pricing actions, I guess that\u2019s a trend, and that\u2019s the same trend for the consumer business as well? ", "Chris Connor", "As Shawn commented on the earlier portion, you know, our track record here, and this price increase has been coming in pretty much consistent with cash price increases.  It takes a little while for us to get announcements out to negotiate and start to see the effectiveness.  And some time on the consumer side with that lag, stores start early by full implementation. ", "Typically, across all segments we see somewhere in the 70 to 80% implementation. ", "Amy Zang -  Goldman Sachs", "Got you.  And my final follow-up question is, the guidance, just a clarification.  The guidance you issued in April, that guidance didn\u2019t include the $0.08, the charges relative to the [inaudible], right? ", "Chris Connor", "", "That\u2019s absolutely correct.  That was an opportunity that presented itself in the quarter that was on any previous guidance.  ", "Amy Zang -  Goldman Sachs", "So on the actual basis, you actually didn\u2019t lower your underlying guidance, you just included that $0.08.  That means that $0.08 is a rare occurring item?  Is there \u2013 ", "Chris Connor", "", "That\u2019s correct.  You\u2019ve got it correct. ", "Amy Zang -  Goldman Sachs", "Okay.  Thank you so much. ", "Bob Wells", "", "Thanks, Amy. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our next question is coming from [RonViswanahan] of Susquehanna", "[RonViswanahan] \u2013 Susquehanna", "", "Hey guys.  Thanks for taking my question.  How are you guys doing? ", "Chris Connor", "", "Doing great.  How are you?", "[RonViswanahan] \u2013 Susquehanna", "Good.  Just a couple quick questions.  First off, I guess a little bit more high level.  It looks like, as everyone said, you\u2019ve kept the guidance the same, but expectations for top line seem to be moderating both from you guys and the rest of the market.  And existing was out today and it was slightly worse than expected. ", "What gives you the confidence, I guess, that you can keep the guidance the same?  Is it mainly just the cost side and so on? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Well, you know, if you went back to our full-year guidance on sales for the full year, three months ago we gave guidance for the year.  It was mid-to-high single digits.  So we really haven\u2019t changed the sales guidance for the year, nor the EPS guidance. ", "So we feel our sales are going to come in pretty much where we thought we would be three months ago.  ", "[RonViswanahan] \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay.  But why are you confident of that, I guess is my question given the recent moderation in the market information that we\u2019re seeing? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Well, I think the other leverage that are played here, Ron, are in good shape.  We commented about the SG&A control, the company, the improved efficiency as a result of the top things we did a year or so ago to get some of our plants down.  The margin performance, while down 60 basis points in this rapid raw-material environment with more pricing implementation from previously announce pricing, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll be in that range.  ", "[Ron Viswanahan] \u2013 Susquehanna", "Okay.  I guess similarly along those lines, you did see the margins expand, you know, as you noted in consumer as well as slightly in paint stores just on the segment side.  How much further can those go from a segment basis? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Yeah.  I think when you sit there and take a look at improvement in operating margins, you know, two, three years ago our storage group was over 15 \u00bd%.  Consumer is not as consistent as store, but it\u2019s actually been as high as 19 at one time. ", "So you know, our thoughts are that eventually we\u2019re going to get back those levels and go higher.  When you look at the global group, now we believe that eventually we\u2019ll be around 80% of where stores can be, which would tell you that we think it\u2019s going to be in the low double-digits, low teens.  So when you think about it, that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for for the segment. ", "[Ron Viswanahan] \u2013 Susquehanna", "And you feel like you can do that in this kind of moderate sales growth environment even, or even declining? ", "Bob Wells", "", "Over long-term when we look at those types of things, we believe that there will be some sales growth.  But we still think we can get a margin improvement in moderate sales growth. ", "[Ron Viswanahan] \u2013 Susquehanna", "Right.  Okay.  Thanks. ", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  Our last question is coming from Robert Gooch of Mac Capital ", "Robert Gooch \u2013 Mac Capital", "", "Hi.  Good afternoon  I think you guys said that on the new home sales, you\u2019re sort of looking at 500,00 to 600,000.  Could you comment on both existing size as well as on the non-resi side? ", "Chris Connor", "", "Yeah.  Let me deal with non residential first.  In non-residential, square footage put in place through June were down in the mid-20% range.  We think that that rate of decline has moderated somewhat from last year.  We don\u2019t think we\u2019re on bottom yet.  We think that\u2019s probably a good number for the balance of the year, is we\u2019re going to finish the year down in the 20%, 20-plus percent range.  ", "In terms of sales of existing homes, it certainly softens somewhat also after the expiration of a tax credit because that was driving some resales as well.  What is important to us Robert, in looking at those numbers is not just the sheer volume, but the quality of the transaction.  ", "Foreclosed and distressed properties being acquired out of foreclosure by investors really doesn\u2019t drive our end markets as well as existing home sales by an owner-occupant to a new owner-occupant.  ", "So to the extend that we can \u2013 I mean, if volume is flat from last year, and the quality improves because of the decline in foreclosure transactions, that\u2019s good for us.  We know that there\u2019s certainly more pain to come in the foreclosure market, but it\u2019s been fairly orderly and we\u2019ve seen a steady rise in the quality transactions.  ", "But a flat number in existing home sales with improving quality would benefit our business. ", "Robert Gooch \u2013 Mac Capital", "I got you.  Just one followup on that very point.  I mean, with the modifications that have been going on on the mortgage side, and I think it\u2019s mixed results.  Maybe people were thinking a little further out, they\u2019re just going to fail again.  ", "My last question pertains to the previous question.  You mentioned your key margins were in both the consumer groups as well as the store group.  And that was also a very high [inaudible] and a good quality on the existing, and certainly on the new stuff.  ", "I guess, I\u2019m just thinking about this, I guess you\u2019re looking more on the cost side, whether SG&A initiatives or others to offset what\u2019s going to be sort of \u2013 seems to just a lower volume than what took place three or four years ago. ", "Chris Connors", "", "You know, I would say it\u2019s cost, but it\u2019s also productivity.  It think when you think about the stores group, Bob mentioned that we opened over 160 stores in new markets.  When we take a look at that we had to close some redundant stores.  ", "As we continue to get more pentitration in markets we get more productivity in markets.  And so when you take a look at the makeup of our store\u2019s organization two or three years from now versus three years ago, we\u2019ll have higher store counts and we\u2019ll be more productive.  And we can probably hit the peak margins at weaker sales.  That\u2019s what we believe.  ", "We also believe the same thing in consumer group.  We think that as we continue to get more productivity, what we have said is that we think we can hit our peak margins without hitting our peak sales.  ", "And then you look at the global group.  It\u2019s the same thing.  As we continue to get more mass in individual countries, we\u2019re going to be able to get that margin up.  ", "And on the first part of your question ,clearly there is more pain to come in the housing markets and we haven not called the bottom on the housing markets.  We think that foreclosure activity to come is going to keep pressure on home values and that won\u2019t right itself for a while yet.  ", "We should point out thought that a lot of the vitality we\u2019re seeing in the residential repaint markets are not so much driven by the traditional drivers, which are existing home turnover, but they\u2019re being driven by pent-up demand from postponed maintenance activity by people who are staying in their house.  And we think that that\u2019s what\u2019s driving some of the goodness in the market today.  ", "Robert Gooch \u2013 Mac Capital", "", "Got you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much for answering my question.  ", "Operator", "Thank you.  I\u2019d like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing comments. ", "Chris Connor", "", "Great.

For the full year, sales increased 9.6% to $7.78 billion. Sales from acquisitions increased consolidated net sales 8.7% in the quarter and 3.4% for the full year.

For the full year 2010, SG&A expense increased $193.3 million but also decreased as a percent of sales to 35.1% from 35.7% in 2009. Incremental SG&A from acquisitions, higher service costs resulting from increased sales and higher freight and distribution costs account for the majority of the SG&A increase in the quarter and year. ", "A fourth quarter asset impairment charge of $4.5 million was offset by a reduction in environmental expenses related to the disposition of closed manufacturing sites in the quarter. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter last year, asset impairment charges and a loss on the dissolution of a foreign subsidiary reduced diluted net income per common share for the quarter by approximately $0.13 per share.

For the year, interest expense was $70.6 million, an increase of $30.6 million over 2009. The incremental interest expense related to the repurchase of long-term debt reduced diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.04 in the quarter and $0.12 for the full year. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2010 increased to 29.7% from 19.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009.

First, a Wisconsin Court of Appeals upheld the judgment in favor of the defendants in the Thomas case, a personal injury suit tried in 2007. Second, a federal court judge in Wisconsin ruled the risk contribution theory adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in the Thomas case to be unconstitutional, violating defendant's right to due process. This ruling is now on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. ", "That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2010, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2011. Chris?", "Christopher Connor", "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody, and thanks you for joining us today. I think we're going to look back on 2010 as a positive transition year for our company and the domestic paints and coatings industry as we bounced off of the bottom. The U.S. recession that began in 2008 technically ended in mid-2009, but the recovery in most of our end markets didn't begin until almost a year later and its strength and sustainability remain in question. ", "We finished 2010 with consolidated sales growth in the high-single digits, thanks in part to three acquisitions and multiple price increases taken in response to persistent raw material cost pressures. All three of our reportable segments grew sales organically in the year. Volume growth was modest but also positive across all segments, the first time in several years I've been able to say that. There was considerable disparity in the strength of demand across end markets, distribution channels and geographies. In North America, sales to our residential repaint contractors and DIY customers through our paint stores show the greatest improvement. Non-residential repaint activity also picked up moderately in the second half. The strength in our Global Finishes Group business was more broad-based with sales growth across most product lines and in most geographic markets. ", "If 2010 did mark the end of the four-year slide in domestic coatings industry volume, we believe the recovery from here is likely to be slow and erratic. Most forecasts for new construction in the coming year call for modest increases on top of the low base established in 2010. Home maintenance and remodeling activity, which was a relative bright spot last year, should continue to improve the overall economy and consumer confidence. Industrial coatings volumes will grow in line with the somewhat more robust recovery in manufacturing and infrastructure investment. Unfortunately, the one area that we are most confident we will see significant year-over-year increases is raw material costs. Strong global demand for certain commodities, most notably titanium dioxide, as well as limited capacity will keep upward price pressure on these materials for the foreseeable future. Key petrochemical feedstocks, such as propylene, have risen sharply over the past month, which will have an adverse impact of the market price for monomers, latex and solvents. These conditions will drive the market basket of raw materials higher in 2011. Based on what we see today, average raw material cost for the paint and coatings industry is likely to be up in the low double-digit range in 2011. ", "We cannot control the economic environment we operate in, but we can effectively manage our response to it and we have. Throughout last year, we took many difficult steps to help minimize the impact of rising commodity costs and raw material shortages on our customers and our business. These included: redistributing raw materials and finished goods between plants, distribution centers and stores; implementing priority production plans; combining certain materials on the spot market to maintain acceptable service levels. The resulting higher operating costs combined with rising raw material costs put pressure on our margins, and we responded with necessary price increases. The normal lag between rising input costs and the realization of our price increases resulted in declining gross margin each of the past three quarters. Our full year SG&A expense as a percent of sales declined 60 basis points on a consolidated basis and was lower across all three segments. Much of the incremental SG&A spending in absolute dollars was a result of acquisitions and expansion of our paint stores platform, investments that we're confident will drive future top line and bottom-line growth. ", "For the year, we generated $707 million in net operating cash, slightly more than 9% of sales. Free cash flow, which is operating cash minus CapEx and dividends, came in at $425 million. During the year, we invested approximately $360 million to complete three acquisitions. Two of these companies strengthen our position in the global finishes market and provide a strong platform for growth in Eastern and Western Europe, as well as Asia-Pacific. The third acquisition establishes us as the market leader in architectural paint in Ecuador. Our working capital ratio increased 11.9% of sales at year end from 10.7% at the end of 2009. Backing out the working capital from the three acquisitions completed during the year, working capital at year end was essentially flat at 10.8% of sales. ", "Last year, we also continued to invest in our control distribution platform, opening 49 stores in new markets to drive penetration and share growth. At the same time, we consolidated an additional 13 redundant store locations for a net increase of 36 stores. Our paint store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean now stands at 3,390 locations compared to 3,354 one year ago. Our plan for 2011 calls for net new store openings in the range of 50 to 60 locations. ", "In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1.53 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full-year total of 5 million shares at an average cost of $75.14 per share and a total investment of $375 million. At year end, we had remaining authorization to acquire another 5.75 million shares. Over the past year, we also returned more than $156 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2010 marked our 32nd consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of a dividend payout rate for 2011 that'll keep our record of consecutive annual dividend increases intact. ", "Looking ahead to 2011, the outlook for many of our end markets is stable to improving, and we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow share. Counteracting this improving demand environment is the fact that raw material cost inflation is likely to remain a challenge, and volume will be negatively impacted due to the loss of architectural paint gallons at Wal-Mart. ", "Our outlook for the first quarter of 2011 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid- to high-teens compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.48 to $0.58 per share compared to $0.30 per share earned in the first quarter of 2010. For the full year 2011, we expect net sales will increase by a high-single digit percentage versus 2010. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for next year will be in the range of $4.65 to $5.05 per share compared to $4.21 earned in 2010. Again, thanks for joining us this morning, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.", "Kevin McCarthy", "If I look at your sales growth and back out currency and the effect of acquisitions, looks like it was up about 9.5%. I was wondering if you could comment on how much of that would be attributable to volume versus price given the various increases you've had flowing through?", "Robert Wells", "Yes, Kevin, the balance would be a little more volume than price.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Okay. And then, Chris, with regard to your outlook for 2011, what is embedded in that with regard to the U.S. architectural industry gallonage that you would foresee this year?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, Kevin, we don't have a lot of economic forecasting thinking that we do here. We look at the same information that you see. We think that housing starts are likely to be up slightly, perhaps in the low 600,000 range. We think existing home turnover will probably be fairly flat, plus or minus about 5 million units. So it's all those things kind of baked in there and a more normalized kind of maintenance schedule, probably is going to look more traditional in the range of low-single digits, what we would see in a typical environment, albeit off a lower base.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Great. And then lastly if I may, on acquisitions, you mentioned a $0.05 dilution in the fourth quarter. Can you, I guess, comment on the integration there and how you would see the accretion flowing as 2011 progresses?", "Sean Hennessy", "This is Sean Hennessy. And when you take a look at the progress we're making, we feel pretty good about the progress we're making. But as we mentioned on the last call, we believe the acquisition, in total, will be slightly dilutive in the first quarter. And for the full year, they will be slightly accretive for the year. And when we look at that, slightly means less than $0.05 a share.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I think you said that in 2011, you expect your consolidated sales to grow by a high-single digit rate. And I was a little bit puzzled by that because if your prices are up roughly 4% to 5% and there's a 3% acquisition benefit, and you think the market is growing 2% to 3%, you get numbers like 10% or 11%. So is it the case that your forecast really includes no volume growth for next year? I don't know how else to make sense of your high-single digit change.", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, let me just take the first pass at it, Jeff, and I'll let Sean comment as well. I think the headwinds that we're seeing going into next year are going to be around the market uncertainties. We have commented that things are looking a little better. We like to believe that next year will continue to show some recovery, but the recovery that we have experienced has been extremely choppy. And so as we sit here now, to be able to indicate that all of next year is going to be a steady, smooth recovery, we're not quite sure we're prepared to make that comment. Also as we discussed with the investment community at some length during the middle part of this year, Wal-Mart's decision to eliminate our architectural paint program is going to have a significant impact on the consumer segment. We commented that it would be less than $100 million, but still that's going to be a substantial gallon numbers for us to overcome. So those two things have some headwind. Sean, do you have some other thoughts for Jeff?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, I think Chris said it perfectly. I think, Jeff, when you continue to do your model and you try to back into some kind of a unit volume, that's when you realize the Wal-Mart effect on the volume.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then lastly, when you think about what you might earn for next year, are you including additional increases in acrylics and TiO2? Or does your model really just include all of the increases that we've seen so far as they come into the New Year?", "Christopher Connor", "Are you talking about the cost impact to us or the pricing that we might take to the market?", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "In other words, you think that you'll earn somewhere between $4.65 and $5.05, and that's based on some kind of sales growth and some kind of raw materials expectation. And I was wondering whether your raw materials expectation anticipates additional TiO2 prices, the increases that we haven't seen yet or additional acrylic prices increases that we haven't seen yet. Or does it simply include what we've seen so far?", "Christopher Connor", "It includes what we have seen so far plus what we think will happen in the raw materials. So as you know, when you're doing a forecast, what you know so far is 100% certain. But we do have forecasts in there for different materials and so forth, and we're looking at the basket of raw materials for the paint industry to be up in the double-digit area. So when you take a look at that, that will include some type of a forecast for certain things and certain increases that we think will come throughout the calendar year 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Sean, looking at the working capital, looks like it was managed very well in the quarter and the year, especially with the higher unit sales and rising raw material costs. Can you talk about what's working there and what the outlook might be for 2011?", "Sean Hennessy", "Chuck, we were. We felt pretty good about the year. With the acquisitions, we were in the high 11s, 11.7%, up from 10.7% last year. Without the acquisitions, we were at 10.8% with those factors. That did cause us to be a source of -- use of cash this year versus last year, a source, but we think two things are going to occur over time. We think the acquisitions, we're going to be able to, again, start to approach 11% in total. Just think a couple of years ago, it took us a couple years, they're not as quick on outside domestic borders as well versus the international. But we think, eventually, we're going to get back down into that 11% range. And domestically, we're pretty happy with what we were able to do with the inventory and our receivables. And when you look at the receivables, we feel pretty good thinking about the market that we've just come through. But again, we think it will take us a couple years, but we'll get back down in that 11% range.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "I guess part of the offset with the rising raws is payables go up as well, as well as the inventory on hand?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. Our payable numbers did come in very strong.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. You've got short-term debt of $388 million, an increase from last year. What are your plans for that? And where do you think that'll go in 2011?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think we've been trying to get into this 60-40, 60% fixed, 40% floating. We were able to get closer to that. Last year, we were about 98% fixed. The two things we're trying to get to are floating, to take advantage of the short-term rates; and secondly, to get some non-domestic debt to create some natural hedges in some of these countries that we're in now for currency hedges. So we look at the gross debt, was around $1,050,000,000, net was just below $1 billion. We think that next year will be slightly higher than that $1,050,000,000. So somewhere in the $1,050,000,000 to $1.125 billion, but we also expect our EBITDA to grow. So we think that our leverage will not be much higher than we are today.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. Chris, a question for you regarding DIY sales in the fourth quarter. Are those re-emerging as a more significant, or is that re-emerging as a more significant end market given what's happened to housing starts?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, as we commented, Chuck, in the body of the call, the strength, particularly in the stores business has been in res repaint, which would include both the professional and painting contractors and DIY. And we had a very strong DIY, actually, third and fourth quarter in our stores this year.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Is that due to it getting stronger because people are choosing to do more? Or there is just less new home construction allowing it to show up a little more clearly?", "Christopher Connor", "I think the rebounding consumer confidence and the deferred maintenance and decorating that we've been talking about for a number of years is starting to have an impact more than the new residential home construction starts.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And then last question back to you, Sean, you've got a lot of things going on in the other income area, with somehow dividend and royalty income becoming an expense item versus an income item a year ago. You had the interest expense up quite a bit partly because of the share repo. But it all boils down into a very big increase in the administrative cost line that you show in your segment reporting. Can you put together what the pieces are that expanded that number? And how much of it was non-cash? And what are the gains from the sale of closed manufacturing assets that appeared in the P&L?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. The year-over-year change in the Admin segment appears large due to the fact that in 2009, Chuck, our administration expense was down as a result of adjustments in compensation and related expenses, including stock-based compensation. The change is less dramatic when compared to 2008 and '07. The primary contributor to the higher administration expense in -- the higher interest expense, including the repurchase of those long-term debts and the year-to-year change in compensation and benefits, including the change in stock-based compensation. You also bring up a couple other things there. We did sell three non-utilized assets, and we had a gain on that. That was cash positive. We took the proceeds in, and we were able to reduce some accruals that we had there for ongoing maintenance of those sites, as well as the gain on sale. We also had a hit in our rabbi trust for that long-term deferred compensation, which is not a cash use. It's just accrual. And over time, we would probably get that back over time because of investments that we've made.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "So getting back to those three plants, the proceeds from them, we'll see in the cash flow statement. But the gains showed up in what line item?", "Sean Hennessy", "All Other.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All Other? Okay, so the gain's there. So the compensation, year-over-year compensation adjustment...", "Sean Hennessy", "Is in the SG&A in the Admin segment.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Yes, okay. So that's a very big item then?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna International Group.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Chris, question on sort of channel shifts. Paint stores' volumes were up for the first time this year. You were flat for the first nine months when the market was up. So are you regaining share through the Paint Stores Group? Or do you think that you'll continue to see more competitor big boxes?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, Don, we're confident that the Stores Group has in fact gained share this year across a number of segments that we monitor. Our volumes were actually up third and fourth quarter through that segment. And as we commented, while we've seen some nice performance out of the residential repaint, contractor and DIY, even in the segments that were off for us, new residential construction, commercial contractors, et cetera, we're confident the results we showed were stronger than what the market felt. So that source model continues to be a shared ramp for us.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "And to what extent do you think you're benefiting from a decision by other people to reduce their overall stores count?", "Christopher Connor", "Well clearly, we monitor that carefully, Don, the gap between our total store count versus the other folks that we compete against in the space. This has been a rough three- to four-year cycle. We've seen quite a number of independents go out of business and a number of the other super-regionals reduce their store count. We've continued to have a positive store addition number each and every year to the cycle.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "And a question for Sean, what do you see as a full year benefit in 2011 from your manufacturing rationalizations in the Consumer Group over the last 18 months or so?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think that what we've said is, because you're going to see it in the gross margin, but we think it was a little, slightly higher than $20 million to $25 million.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Gregory Melich with ISI Group.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "I wanted to talk a little bit about the outlook on the cadence of your price increases. So we had 15%, a lot last year. Looks like you got a normal amount of that through so far. So as you go into this year, do you expect gross margin to -- it seems like in the first half, you expect them to be down as much as they were in the second half of 2010. Is that a fair way to think about it or am I...", "Sean Hennessy", "We're going to try to avoid going down the model, Greg. And this is Sean. We've tried that, especially at the beginning of the year, we try to give you some outside looks at the sales of what we think in the sales and EPS. But a lot of times, as in the past, we mentioned, after the second quarter call, we've given you some type of guidance on gross margin and other things when we have a better view of selling prices that, what you're asking about, and also raws, back to what Jeff was saying, we've got a better view of what's going to hit in the current calendar year. But I think we're going to avoid giving any kind of guidance on gross profit at this time.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "So maybe then a different question, which is just looking at the pricing. In the past, it's usually taken maybe a year to, sort of, get through your normal 75%, 80%. Do you think that's still the case? Or has something changed in the last year or two in the market out there, where it's either it's able to happen faster or slower?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, as you mentioned, we put three price increases in. We put the first one in April and then again in August. And both of those are really reacting just like as historical. We feel that we've got enough time looking at the market. We think that it's running correctly or just like the normal. When you take a look at December 6, it's not that we've seen anything abnormal, it's just that December is our slowest month. And we'll probably give you a little more color on that at the end of the first quarter. But it's just, since it's December 6, and December's our smallest month, I'll avoid talking about that. But we think that the market forces are still in place, that when the raw materials go up, eventually we will get it back in the selling price.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "And then a follow up on the Consumer Group, the big expansion in margin there. Would you say that the benefits that you saw, if you quantify them in dollars, is that now pretty much behind us, where you've been able to take that business up to a new level of efficiency at this run rate?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. I think that we've realized 100%. It did come in tapered. We did start to see some in late '08, throughout '09 and now '10. We're at a fairly good run rate.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay, great. And then lastly, on the SG&A dollars last year, up I guess a couple hundred million, I think you said a majority was acquisition, any more precision on that, like 2/3 or a dollar amount would be helpful.", "Christopher Connor", "We commented, Greg, that it was between the new stores and the acquisitions, but that's as much guidance as we're giving.", "Gregory Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. But a majority, the acquisitions I think were a majority of it, was that right?", "Christopher Connor", "That's fair.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with Buckingham Research.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research Associations", "There were still a lot of small competitors in the industry that I would assume have a harder time maintaining service levels in this environment and are not as sophisticated in pricing. So why not take the Wal-Mart volume and try to accelerate your professional stores volume, add more stores this year, do something strategic?", "Christopher Connor", "John, that's been the goal every year for the last 145. We certainly aren't throttling back on that at all. We talked about a net new store count this year in the 50 to 60 range. There'll be some still remaining closures from our big acquisition run in the middle of the last decade, but we're getting up to a closer kind of a gross opening run that we've had historically. And rest assured, that team is aggressively out looking to grow gallons.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research Associations", "That just doesn't seem like they're growing enough to absorb the Wal-Mart capacity that you've got available.", "Christopher Connor", "They're never growing fast enough. You sound like us.", "John Roberts - Buckingham Research Associations", "Okay. And then, secondly, could you talk about the things that are in your control to do, to sort of mitigate some of the raw materials like changing container strategies or changing suppliers or changing formulations? What are you doing internally that's within your control?", "Christopher Connor", "We'll comment on some of the broad themes of controls that we do have. At the outset, let me comment that the significant raw material supplier relationships that we have, for the most part, are really critical to the final manufacturing products that we make. So the ability to drastically change those relationships is not strong, nor do we want it to be. And so we're really talking about some of the items around the fringe. And you mentioned a number of them. Through formulation, we can find some way to optimize formulas, to use less of these. We can bring other raw material suppliers up to paint-grade levels and quantify and qualify their raw materials as a source. We're capable of moving some of our purchasing from various suppliers. We're able to bring some of these raw material productions in-house, as we do make some resins inside the company. So there's a variety of strategies at play here, none of which will be significant to put a real dent in the numbers that we've commented on.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Rob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire", "This is actually Brian Maguire on for Bob. As you mentioned, raw material prices have continued to move up so far in 2011. We've seen propylene and titanium dioxide continue to go up. Is it too early to think that we might see another price increase in the spring? Or do you think that the December one kind of covers you for the first half of '11?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, we've been real clear about this, Brian, in terms of giving the Street great transparency into our pricing activities, when we take them, the amount that we've taken, et cetera, when we announce it down to the specific date. Sean just commented on December 6. However, on prospective price increases, we don't comment on that, not until we've thought through the process, spoken with our customers first, et cetera. So the pricing that we've announced in the fourth quarter of last year is intended to carry us into this New Year, and we'll just have to wait and see how the raw material pricing unfolds and whether or not additional pricing is required. I think you can rest comfortably that historically, you can see the company has always had the same discipline here, that pushing back against raws first, trying to see if we can mitigate that internally through our own operations and then finally, failing those two steps, we will go to the market for pricing if we need to. At this point in time, there are no intentions or plans for further price increases.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. And I was also wondering if you've seen any disruptions or loss of sales so far from the kind of adverse weather we've had kind of so far in January?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, the eastern seaboard has particularly been hard hit. Our stores do in fact feel that. There's days when there -- struggle to get them open, or lack of customers through the front door. You'll rarely hear this company talk about weather. We believe that weather comes every year. You're going to have these storms that are going to go through. They may impact a given week or month or even quarter but over the greater year, it's just not a thing we're concerned about.", "Brian Maguire", "One just housekeeping item, what kind of tax rate are you guys assuming for 2011?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, this year, we're around $31.7, and we think it's going to be slightly higher than that. But we still think it will be in the mid- to low-30s.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Stephen East with Ticonderoga Securities.", "Stephen East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC", "When you talked about, Chris, you talked about raw materials overall being up low-double digits. What percentage of your selling price is that as you look out into '11?", "Christopher Connor", "Last quarter, you talked about TiO2 being 20% to 30%, and so it was impacting about six percentage points, something like that. As a rule, Stephen, the basket of raw materials in a typical architectural gallon of paint accounted for about half of the selling price. So the 12% raw material cost increase would dictate a 6% selling price increase on a like gallon of paint to keep the gross margin dollars consistent on that product. Is that the question?", "Stephen East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC", "Yes, that is the question. And if you look at your guidance, obviously you're looking at a decline in margins, at least net margin versus 2010. Two questions on that. One, is that sort of the new normal, or is that just the temporary until your pricing can catch up to your raw materials? And is it primarily occurring, that decline in margin, primarily occurring at the operating margin? Or is there a lot of below the line noise for us?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, when you take a look at, first I'll mention the gross margin. We don't think it's changed. I think when two years ago, we hit -- last year, we hit 46%. In 2009, our long-term goal is that we think that we can eventually get back at and above that to a new peak. When you look at operating margins, we feel the same way. We don't think it's a new norm. When you look at 2007, 2008, we've commented eventually, we think that we've put the company in a position that we can get at and above those margins. So when you talk about the guidance for next year, I think when you first go out there at the beginning of the year, you have a lot of puts and takes, and you don't have just one scenario. You'll have three or four. And it used to be, at least a couple years ago, we actually got it to 12%, but our guidance was as wide as $1, between $3 and $4. So we're at $0.40, we have about three or four different scenarios. And what ends up happening is we start to see how the year starts out. And we start to get a better feel for what we think the raws are going to be at for the year and the selling prices, and it's a lot of other things wrapped in. And then we'll start squeezing it down and give you a little more answer and color on that. But that's really where we're at with the guidance.", "Stephen East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC", "Okay, that's fair enough. One, could you talk about the commercial trends? And then two, Sean, I appreciate fixed versus floating and trying to capture the low-floating rates, but we're at generational lows for interest rates. At what point do you all say, for the better good of the company, a little bit longer term, we probably need to move away from that 60-40 split, fixed versus variable?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think when you take a look at it, a couple years ago, we went out and did a five-year deal at 3.1%. We're monitoring the market right now. And we watch commercial paper and the dealers right now. We're able to get one, three, six-month commercial paper, as well as overnight. So we feel the commercial paper market is still fairly robust, at well below 0.5 point of interest. So we think that's still pretty good for the shareholders. When we start to see that tighten up, we probably would do what you said.", "Christopher Connor", "And then, Stephen, your question was on the commercial market trends?", "Stephen East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC", "Yes, sir.", "Christopher Connor", "Our expectation here, again, same caveat about the lack of economic forecasting that we hold ourselves accountable for in looking at the same kind of industry data that you can see, we believe that non-residential construction, the spending to that will be flat to down moderately. It's been pretty low, there's not a lot more to fall there. And we do think however, that non-residential occupancy rates and turnovers are going to improve a little bit and that will help on the stronger market, which is the maintenance side of it anyway. So all in, perhaps, the commercial side of this business should have a flat to slightly up year.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill", "Just firstly, Sean, without getting into specifics for the year and not looking for an absolute number here, but if we think about the price increases going through the way they typically would, and what you've seen already with raw materials and how those will flow out of inventory, can you talk to the pace of margin contraction or expansion through the year? What would be the most challenging period for the year if things play out under a normal scenario based on what's already happened?", "Sean Hennessy", "Well, I think in a normal scenario, you would say the first quarter would be the best situation because we're anniversary-ing three price increases overall. So after April, we start to anniversary that first price increase. So the actual effect of selling prices on the volume will be the highest in the first quarter. And then as we annualize them, it'll be reduced. So when you take a look at steps, the year-over-year sales and then the year-over-year selling price increases. But really, when we take a look at how the raw materials flowed in and out, it's been anything but normal. So I think it's hard right now to say exactly which quarter is going to be the highest or where we're going to see the lowest peaks.", "Dennis McGill", "Just to help maybe clarify that from the raw material increase, the double digit for the year, can you give us a sense for those that exited 2010 on a year-over-year basis?", "Sean Hennessy", "It's below that double digit. And the fourth quarter raw materials were the highest quarter increase that we had.", "Dennis McGill", "Meaning the year-over-year increase in the year was higher than the other?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Christopher Connor", "It was accelerating through the year, exactly right.", "Dennis McGill", "On the Consumer segment, just to clarify, Sean, did you say the $20 million to $25 million from restructuring was the benefit in '10 or the carry-through into '11?", "Sean Hennessy", "2010. What we realized in 2010. And now, and I've also said it, we've realized 100% of that.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And so when we think about '11, realizing you'll have the volume challenge of Wal-Mart, you didn't mention pricing in your comments of the benefit in the fourth quarter there. So I know you don't want to speak by segment for price, but when you think about profitability in that segment looking forward, is there a scenario where you can see operating margin improve without replacing the Wal-Mart volume?", "Sean Hennessy", "Well, I think so. I think that, that segment is also working on selling price increases. And so they're out there today working on that and they're getting some. So that's part of the effectiveness that we talk about when we say what over time we eventually get to, and why it takes a little bit longer. But when you take a look at it, that segment's out there implementing price increases.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And then just lastly, Chris, I don't know if you have to take a stab at this or if you know specifically, but on the non-res buildings, construction or commercial, what would be the split between the maintenance and your construction for your business today?", "Robert Wells", "Dennis, this is Bob. New construction will be a very small piece of the commercial market, probably similar to new construction in residential versus residential repaint, maybe 20% or below.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "On a bigger scale, during the downturn, you tried to get more DIY business in your stores. Was that DIY business done at a lower price point than where a contractor would come in?", "Christopher Connor", "No, the opposite.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "Because you had lowered some prices to get the DIY consumer in...", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, I think the DIY consumer is moved by promotional activity. That's been a forever marketing strategy in our industry. We were aggressive on our promotion schedules to the DIY consumers through our stores this year, P.J. That, again, has been consistent. However, the DIY pricing starts at a considerably higher level than what a professional painter would buy similar products for. So even with discounting, that mix would have been positive as we switch to DIY.", "Sean Hennessy", "I can tell you, in each of the four quarters, the DIY gross margin was higher than the painting contractor gross margin in the Stores Group. And that was true for every quarter last year, even with the discounting.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "And just quickly, are you developing any paint that uses less TiO2? And was wondering if you've done new trials and what the findings were?", "Christopher Connor", "Sure, all of the time. We're working on both types of opportunities. And there's a lot of nice technology out there that's helping extend the use of titanium in formulations so that less can be used to achieve the same types of performance. So some of those products are winding their way to market, some are in tests. And I think there will be continuing science in that regard, not only from the paint manufacturers themselves but other raw material suppliers that see the same kind of tightness in the titanium environment. This, too, P.J., has been historic in our industry. And as we've gone through these titanium cycles in the past, other raw material technologies emerged that help mitigate the use of that. So I would expect we'll continue to see more of that going forward.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "Now what would you say, this low TiO2 usage, would that be 5% of your paint? Would there be less or more than that?", "Christopher Connor", "No. Again, when I think -- there was another question about what strategies do we have, and we made the comment that these types of movements are really around the edges of the core body of products that we sell. So I'd be hesitant or reluctant, or even unprepared, to comment on that percentage. But I don't think you're far off in terms of thinking it would be very de minimis in the under 5% range.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "I was wondering if you could make a little bit of sense of your earnings guidance. The 1Q increase on a year-over-year basis is relatively material especially in light of the full year increase you're talking about. When you think about the acquisition impact, which is dilutive in the first quarter and then on the balance of the year becomes much less dilutive than it was a year ago, year-over-year incrementally impactful to earnings, I guess I'm just trying to figure out what factors are influencing what appears to more cautious 2Q to Q4 guidance relative to the 1Q guidance?", "Sean Hennessy", "When you take a look at the first quarter, Eric, this is Sean, first of all, the Obamacare. In the first quarter last year, we really had to take a $0.10 hit in our tax rate in the first quarter. And so a couple things, the $0.30 really is $0.40, and so the increase is not as dramatic. And the first quarter, $0.10 in the first quarter, makes dramatic because it's our smallest quarter. So when you take that in consideration and some of the things that went the other way, where we were able to sell those assets, we're going to go up against that in the fourth quarter. We have some other things that were going to go up against other quarters. It just seems like this, probably, was one of the biggest movement quarters quarter-by-quarter. We had a lot of different moving parts, but when you take a look at that Obamacare, it's dramatic in the first quarter.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "But even if you take out that, and you take out the, I think the roughly $0.25 of net expenses that impacted '10 that won't recur in '11, even when you pull that out the full year earnings on an operating basis are up roughly $0.40, I think at midpoint, and $0.15 of that is in 1Q. It just seems that, even looking it on that [ph] degree and pulling up what you rightly pointed out was the 1Q effect, it seems like there's more in 1Q than you're assuming in 2Q to 4Q on a disproportionate basis. Is there any factor that influences that?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, couple of other things that really affected it. We also had -- in another quarter, we actually had a $9 million sale of -- we sold an asset, and then -- a small asset, but that was $9 million worth of goodness in one quarter. I'd mention again, in other quarters, where we're going up against the sales and then environmental expense. We're going to be doing a lot of remediation this year in our Chicago site, hopefully completing that this year or the first quarter of 2012. So those are the type of things that are going on and that can change quarter by quarter. But the first quarter was, again, the fact that Obamacare -- but I understand what you're saying, but there's just a lot of other things that we take a look at. And at the end of the first quarter and second quarter, then we'll probably have better idea of what's happening with selling prices and raw materials.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Okay. And then secondly, just some clarity, were the volume growth in 4Q similar to 3Q or better than 3Q?", "Sean Hennessy", "Slightly above.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And was that broadly based? Or was there one piece of the business that contributed to that?", "Christopher Connor", "No, I don't know. It's pretty broadly based. All three segments, as we commented, Eric, had improving volumes. And to Sean's point, these are slightly above. These are modestly positive volume numbers in the low-single digits. So all three went the right direction.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "When you look at the margins that we saw in the fourth quarter, particularly in the Consumer and the Global Group, or the decline in sequential margins was less than it was a year ago and you mentioned some one-off things that seem to have impacted the performance last year. Was it all related to that? Or is it that the businesses has changed fundamentally? And the reason why you didn't lose money in the one operation that was actually able to deliver margins that were better than 50 basis points than the other operation.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think when you look at the consumer segment, there's sort of a combination of both. We had some one-time hits last year, we also had the sales in there. But also I go back to the full annualization of the rationalization. So I think there was some business changes that we were able to maintain and so forth, but that's really the big piece there, and the big piece of consumer was those one time. And that's why you saw it go from 1.9 to 10. 1.9 was probably understated because of the hits and so forth. And Stores Group, the 50 basis points, 13, 13.5, that was, I mean, you sit there and see that impairment last year, that was probably the majority of that 50 basis points.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Yes, no, the Store Groups I understand, I was just -- the Consumer Group and the Global were...", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, on the global side, I would tell you, again, in the fourth quarter, we went from minus 0.3% to 4.5%, again last year, really, the impairment. But even with that impairment, we did see the improvement in ROS. So we think that, that's probably a good run rate. Last year, we we're talking about that 3.9% was depressed. This year, 5.9%, again, without the acquisitions. And if you add back there, we had some nice improvement in the ROS, and we think the ROS is on its way here in the Global Group.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Sounds good. And then just a question, if you look on the balance sheet, you've seen the days sales outstanding have increased throughout the year and kind of finished up, what, is it, almost seven days higher than they did a year ago. Inventory turns have dropped a little bit and were a little bit slower than normal throughout the year. Is this just a function of raw material inflation? Or a function of acquisitions and the margins and the working capital requirements that those businesses bring with it?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. And every time we do an acquisition, we see this. If you go back, when we did Duron and Purdy, our working capital went from around 11% to 13.5%. As we continue to integrate those, we actually got it back close to 11%, and we did seven acquisitions a few years ago, and that drove it back up to 12.5%, 12.7%. We actually were able to get back down to the 10.7% last year. So without the acquisitions, our DSO was up slightly, and our inventory days were actually down slightly. And as Chuck pointed out, the raw material inflation that we've seen in our raw materials, really was offset a little bit by the payables number. So the payables covered the inflation somewhat, but we feel pretty good about our working capital with our balance sheet.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got you. And then just final question, are you kind of net long some of the key raw materials given the experiences with some disruptions and lack of availability last year? Or is there just not even enough material available in the market for you to build a little bit of a cushion against future price increases or availability issues?", "Christopher Connor", "We take a look at our production plan, we got asked this a few years ago, we pre-buy. And today, we just don't have the warehouse space. But what we're doing is we've adjusted our production plan to try to -- usually in the first quarter, this is where we build our inventory, to go into the highest sales season, and we're going to do everything we can to slightly be higher than what we would've been normally and higher than we were last year.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of [ph] Ryan Buckus with Citigroup.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on the acquisition landscape and how you see yourself with your current ratings and potentially giving up the current ratings to make an acquisition of a larger scale?", "Christopher Connor", "First of all, Ryan, I think our ratings are fine. And Sean commented earlier about the capital markets, availability to us and we feel like we have terrific access if there were deals out there that were appropriate, strategic and added significant value for our shareholders. Having said that, the type of deals that we've historically done have been much more bolt on and additive to our existing businesses and haven't required significant capital resources to get done. So we don't really find ourselves or feel that we're constrained at all in that regard. The acquisition environment is still better than it was three, four years ago. We're looking at a number of deals. We've talked about consistently our interest in continuing to build out our controlled distribution footprint in North America, as well as adding to our industrial coatings strategy on a global basis. And there are a number of opportunities out there for us to think about it.", "Operator", "Our last question is coming from the line of Andrew Dunn with Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Andrew Dunn", "Just real quickly, going back to the pricing issues, you guys are pretty close to your contractor customers. And as you deal with them, do you get any sense kind of what level of price increasing you might get a pushback from them saying we just can't push this through to our customer base anymore? And then just as a real quick follow-up on the kind of store count issue, I think you guys had talked about kind of the northwestern part of the United States, maybe even Canada moving forward. Are you guys still pretty optimistic on those areas?", "Christopher Connor", "Well, first of all, Andrew, on the first part of your question, the pricing that we get pushed back on from our contractors is 0.5% I mean these are not folks that are excited to get these, nor are we excited to pass them on. So they are doing their job as they should, which is to push back a little bit. As we've talked about the economics of this industry, you recall the typical paint job is 80% to 90% labor cost, 10% to 20% materials. So distasteful as these are, their ability to absorb it, modestly rate their pricing and cover their higher material cost is something that's been easy for them to do. So as Sean said earlier in the call, the price increases that we've implemented last year have all continued to go in on a fairly historic level, and we would expect that to continue going forward. In terms of our store count, you're accurate. And we've talked often about on our density mass at the western part of the United States, partly [ph] Western Canada as well as all of Canada for that matter, are areas that we can heavy up our store. You're seeing that both in our new store openings, as well as our acquisition interest.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the floor back over to Mr. Bob Wells for closing remarks.", "Robert Wells", "Terrific, thanks again, Claudia. Let me wrap up the call this morning by asking you to save the date of Thursday, May 12, 2011, on your calendars. That's the day that we will host our Annual Financial Community Presentation this year at the Waldorf Astoria in midtown Manhattan. The program will consist of our customary morning presentations with questions and answers, followed by a reception and luncheon. Again, that date is Thursday, May 12, and we'll be sending out invitations and related information in the weeks ahead. As usual, we will be around today and tomorrow to take your follow-up calls.

", "After the review of first quarter results, we will open the session to questions. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Robert Wells", "Thanks, Jackie. As usual, in order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter press release. Summarizing overall company performance for first quarter 2011 versus first quarter 2010, consolidated net sales increased 18.5% to $1.86 billion due primarily to acquisitions and selling price increases. Acquisitions increased consolidated net sales 9% and positive currency translation added 1.2%. ", "Consolidated gross profit increased $105.4 million for the quarter to $797.4 million. Gross margin decreased 120 basis points to 43% of sales from 44.2% in the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $78.2 million over first quarter last year to $691.1 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 37.2% this year from 39.1% last year. Interest expense decreased $895,000 compared to the first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $35.2 million or 59% to $94.7 million.", "Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 27.9% compared to 45.2% in the first quarter of 2010. And as a reminder, last year's first quarter tax rate reflected a onetime increase in income tax expense, $11.4 million related to the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which raised our effective tax rate by 19.2% for the quarter.", "For the full year 2011, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range compared to last year's rate of 31.8%. Consolidated net income increased $35.7 million to $68.3 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 3.7% this year compared to 2.1% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased to $0.63 per share from $0.30 per share in 2010. The tax impact of health care legislation reduced last year's first quarter EPS by $0.10 per share.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in first quarter 2011 increased 9.2% to $929.3 million from $850.9 million last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales open more than 12 calendar months, increased 8.9%. The increase in sales for the segment was due primarily to higher selling prices and improving demand in residential repaint and protective and marine market. Regionally, in the first quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions followed by Southeast division, Eastern division and Midwestern division.", "Segment profit for the Group increased 44.2% to $68.9 million in the first quarter 2011 due primarily to selling price increases that were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Segment operating margin increased 7.4% from 5.6% in the first quarter last year. ", "Turning to Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter increased 1% to $294.9 million. The increase was due primarily to selling price increases and the timing of seasonal shipments to some customers that were partially offset by the loss of business at a large retail customer. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased 9.7% in the quarter to $41.1 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 13.9% from 12.8% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued tight expense control and price increases that were partially offset by raw material cost increases.", "Finally, for our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 49.6% to $630.2 million in the quarter due primarily to acquisitions, higher paint sales volume, selling price increases and favorable currency translation rate changes. In the quarter, acquisitions increased net sales by 33.3% and favorable currency translation rate changes added 3.6%.", "First quarter segment profit increased 60% to $36.8 million due to higher sales volume and good expense control. Foreign currency rate changes and acquisitions increased segment profit by $1.6 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 5.8% from 5.5% in the same period last year. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2011 was $1.34 billion including total short-term borrowings of $678.4 million. Total debt on March 31, 2010 was $1.04 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $53.9 million compared to $91.2 million at the end of the first quarter 2010. Total borrowings to capitalization were 45.4% at the end of the quarter versus 41% at the end of the first quarter 2010. Long-term debt-to-capitalization declined to 22.4% at the end of the first quarter this year compared to 31.4% last year due to the repurchase of $137 million in long-term debt back in 2010. ", "In the first quarter of 2011, we spent $27 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $37.3 million and amortization expense was $6.4 million.", "For the full year, we anticipate capital expenditures will be approximately $150 million to $160 million. Depreciation will be about $140 million, and amortization will be approximately $40 million. ", "I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. In the California public nuisance suit, no timetable has yet been set for discovery. Since our year-end 2010 call, the city of Los Angeles has withdrawn from the litigation while Ventura County has joined. On April 19, the Mississippi State Supreme Court heard oral argument on our appeal of the $7 million personal injury award in the Gaines personal injury suit. We expect a decision in the next 90 to 120 days. ", "That concludes our review of the results for first quarter 2011, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. Chris?", "Christopher Connor", "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. We anticipated that 2011 would get off to a strong start, and that was reflected in our first quarter guidance. This expectation was based on the relatively easy comps we faced over the first three months and on the actions we took last year to manage our cost structure and implement necessary price increases. ", "Our first quarter sales of $1.86 billion was the largest opening quarter in our company's history by almost $50 million. What makes this milestone a little less gratifying is that very little of incremental sales came from core volume growth. The majority from acquisitions we completed last year, the multiple price increases we took in response to rising raw material costs and moderately favorable currency translations. Core volume was only slightly positive in the quarter. ", "There were some relative bright spots. Domestic residential repaint sales, both DIY and pro continued to outperform the other architectural segments. Protective and marine coatings demand is picking up in many markets. And our automotive finishes, product finishes and Latin American coatings businesses all delivered solid volume growth. But the continuing volume declines in domestic new construction and many nonresidential repaint segments, coupled with the loss of business at one of our retail accounts, erased most of this positive volume momentum. At this point we remain cautious in our outlook for domestic market demand over the remainder of the year. In the second quarter, we'll also begin to annualize some of the price increases and acquisition revenue, which will make comparisons more difficult going forward.", "First quarter was also a strong quarter in terms of our earnings improvement. Even after adding back to last year the $0.10 per share tax impact of the health care legislation, first quarter 2011 earnings per share was up more than 57%. Consolidated gross margin declined 120 basis points year-over-year due to the rapid increase in raw material cost and gross margin dilution from acquisitions.", "Looking ahead, the impact of higher raw material costs will likely get worse before it gets better. On our last call, we predicted that in 2011, the coatings industry would experience annualized year-over-year raw material price inflation in the low double-digit, 10% to 13%. Given the recent upward trend in propylene and the aggressive pricing actions taken by many of the major raw material suppliers, particularly the TiO2 producers, we now believe a mid-teens percent increase is more realistic. ", "If you look at year-over-year input cost comparisons by quarter, raw materials began to rise in the second quarter last year then accelerated in the third and fourth quarters. Given the rate and timing of increases so far in 2011, the year-over-year increase in raw material cost is likely to be greater in the second quarter, with the rate of increase moderating somewhat in the back half, which means raw material costs are likely to be an even stronger earnings headwind over the balance of the year. ", "First quarter SG&A spending was up over last year and most of this increase was reflected in our budget. The largest contributors to SG&A growth were the three acquisitions, new stores opened since the first quarter last year, the timing of advertising expenditures and increases in compensation expense in Global Group and Paint Stores Group. As a percent of sales, SG&A declined 190 basis points in the quarter compared to last year. ", "Our working capital also increased in the quarter. Backing out working capital from acquisitions, our core working capital increased to 13% of sales from 12.4% last year. Most of the increase was the result of a concentrated effort to build inventory ahead of raw material price hikes and protect against potential material shortages. Of the $189 million increase in finished goods inventory, only $47 million of that was from acquisitions. Raw material inventories also increased $45 million, net of acquisitions.", "During the first quarter, we continued to invest in our controlled distribution platform. Paint Stores Group added 7 net new store locations, bringing our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,397 locations compared to the 3,357 a year ago. Our plan calls for Paint Stores Group to add approximately 50 to 60 new store locations during the year, while the number of store closings should fall back in line with our typical low to mid-single digit pace.", "During the quarter, we used the company's cash to buy back 1.1 million shares of our stock and increase the quarterly dividend rate to $0.365 from $0.36 last year. At March 31, we have remaining authorization to purchase 4.65 million shares of our stock. Our balance sheet remains fiscally sound and capable of financing our planned business operations and growth for the foreseeable future.", "In spite of the challenges we're likely to encounter over the balance of the year, our plan calls for continued improvement in sales and earnings. We anticipate that our consolidated net sales in the second quarter will increase 8% to 13% compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.75 per share compared to last year's record earnings performance of $1.64 per share.", "For the full year 2011, we expect consolidated net sales to increase above 2010 levels by a high single-digit percentage, and with annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our guidance that diluted net income per common share for 2011 is expected to be in the range of $4.65 to $5.05 per share compared to $4.21 per share earned in 2010. Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two things. First of all, on the price cost situation, can you just give us a sense -- you had commented about gross margins in 1Q and 2Q, but can you comment about your thoughts on when and how you get caught up in a balanced recovery and gross margins?", "Sean Hennessy", "Eric, this is Sean Hennessy. Back to your point, just to remind everyone, when you look at the company as a whole, the price mix, we had slight positive volume, most of it was price. When you take a look at it, the other thing that we probably would point out to you in our gross margin is the gross margins on these acquisitions were really the majority of in the first quarter of the decline, the 44.2% down to the 43%. And our core was close to making it up in the first quarter. But as Chris pointed out, with the rapid increases in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, we think that for the full year, when you take a look at our gross profit with the acquisitions and so forth -- and we've shown you that slide in the past. When you have these rapid raw material increases, when we first get those, we do have a decline in our gross profit.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And so to sort of -- to finish that, knowing that this is historically how it works, that it goes down and then it goes back up, can you just talk about sort of the confidence and perhaps the kind of the recovery in the second half?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think when you take a look at the second half of the year, we start to anniversary the acquisitions. And when you start thinking about the way this has worked in the past, we feel very confident that eventually, we will be able to recover the raws and probably with -- from my comment, I would say that we're now starting to talk about 2012 before the gross profit percent gets back into the 2009 and '10 and -- or I'm sorry, 10% and 11%.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then just a follow-up if I can. On the volumes, through Q2 to 4Q last year, you saw some volume growth. You commented that there was just slight volume progress this quarter. Can you talk a little bit about what's going on in there and perhaps about what's going on excluding the impact of the Wal-Mart business?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, I think that the volumes for the company, Eric, were slightly up in the quarter as we commented. Our store volumes through our comp stores was essentially flat. I think kind of what we've been seeing as we've been commenting for a while that there is some strains in the residential repaint segment, but we're still seeing year-over-year declines in demand and new construction market and some of the non-res repaint commercial specifically. And all those things are kind of giving us around this flat volume kind of sense of where we're headed. I think our guidance for the second quarter would indicate if you can kind of back out sort of the acquisition impact and the pricing impact and other modest volume expectation in the second quarter as well. And that's really the visibility that we don't quite have yet for the remainder of the year to see if that's going to rebound or not. At this point in time, we think it's going to be a -- will be a modest year for volume.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JP Morgan.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "You had up operating profit in your Consumer business even though your sales were flat and your raw materials were up in some double-digit rate. So how did you do that?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think with a couple of things, Jeff. You see, the inventory increase, I think we had a really nice conversion rate in the first quarter because of the amount of gallons that we made for a lot that into the efficiencies with their process when we transferred. And secondly, the price -- what they were able to do with some of the price. You just think about the Wal-Mart, we've talked about that being in the range of $70 million to $80 million. And if you take a look at it by quarter, that pretty well speaks -- if you're straight line on that, you're pretty close. They had a 1% sales gain even going up against that Wal-Mart. So we think that has more to do with timing. But they did pretty well with getting the selling price in the volume and then their costs were pretty -- they did a nice job on it.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then lastly, do you guys have a strategy now in titanium dioxide in the sense that none of the small TiO2 players really have the financial strength to build new capacity and DuPont seems, at least at this juncture, a little bit slow in adding capacity. So what will you do? I mean, do you just grin and bear it? Or do you try to work with some TiO2 producers to get to it de facto vertical integration? Or what do you do?", "Christopher Connor", "There's a number of things we're working on, Jeff, to deal with the increasing raw material cost pressures, grin and bearing it among them, by the way. But there are a whole host of projects underway from a technical standpoint to improve the efficiency of titanium's performance in a can of paint, so we can use less of it. There are lesser quality titanium manufacturers that are stepping up. Their consistency, they can get those products into paint grade. There's a whole host of activities underway. And I think what invariably ends up happening, when we see historically the same kind of the titanium cycle when pricing and operating margins in the business get too inflated, capacity comes back on. More people will cut price and look for market share gains inside the industry. DuPont's earnings was released this morning. The numbers on their performance chemical segment were off the charts, incredible. And I think that bodes well for some additional activity in this industry, whether it's capacity coming on or some price variance. So we'll see what happens. History is our guide here. This is a cycle that will have a back end to it. And it's our intention to be in pretty good shape when we get there.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "If you look at your raw materials into three buckets, you have resins, pigments and solvents. Can you just size for us how much of -- how much are these -- each of these broken up?", "Christopher Connor", "We haven't broken it down that way, P.J. Generally, we just -- first, obviously, we always talk about industry raw material experience rather than our own. And we prefer to keep it as an overall basket of materials because there's a lot of movement within the basket, and we prefer not to get in at that level of detail. Suffice it to say that there's been pretty -- it's been pretty well documented how much TiO2 is up. And if we see kind of the mid to upper end of that range of inflation applied to TiO2, it gets us to the 8% to 9% inflation on the total basket. So with our mid-teen outlook, it tells you we anticipate pretty significant cost pressures across the rest of the basket, and most of that is propylene related.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "And is the Consumer Group seeing less price increases than the Paint Stores Group? And is there kind of resistance you are seeing from the -- in the Consumer Group from customers?", "Christopher Connor", "No, I think, P.J., we've been consistent when we take price into the market. We're very transparent with the investment community relative to the pricing that we announce through our Stores Group. We give you, kind of, the tenth [ph] of a percentage point and the exact date we take it out. We don't share that same transparency with the Consumer Group given the ongoing discussions we have with various retail partners. But take comfort in the fact that these raw material cost pressures we're feeling are across all of our products, and our disciplines here would be intact, and we would expect our Consumer Group to be in the market with pricing in the same relative range, at the same relative timing that we announce through our stores, and that, in fact, has been the case. And they have been successful in getting pricing this year.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "Sure. And one quick clarification question. Sean, did you say that you've pulled forward some production in the Consumer Group from 2Q into 1Q?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. When you look at our inventory, we did allow our inventory to rise. Last year, we wanted to do two things. We wanted to make sure that we service our customer. Last year there was a lot of concerns about whether we're able to do that with some of the raw material shortages after the Rohm and Haas and Dow conversion. And so we brought -- we build the inventory higher and also helped us strengthen the raw materials before the big rise.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Yes, thank you. A couple of questions on volumes and your channel shifts. As I look at the DOC information, it seems a little puzzling. They show up 7% last year, still have yet to find a coatings manufacturer with 7% volume increases. But I know you've assumed it was up a few points, your Paint Stores were flat. They seem to be flat in the first quarter. So does this reflect again DIY taking share away from the contractor? And I would have thought that with Glidden closing a lot of stores that you'd be the best positioned to benefit from that shift as well. So maybe you can comment on market share shifts and market shares.", "Christopher Connor", "Of course. And by the way Don, as you know this, we agree with your assessment that the Department of Commerce numbers for 2010 don't make a lot of sense. If you look at our customer mix within our Paint Stores Group, you know we're 85% contractor and roughly 15% DIY. Our DIY business has actually been growing pretty dramatically. So if we were the same mix as the market, we'd probably be gaining share across all segments. We're confident that we are not losing share. We're gaining share in the contractor market. But it's just the mix that's causing us to probably -- to grow at a rate equal to or maybe slightly behind the market as opposed to losing share in these segments.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "And then what about the impact of Glidden closing stores. Why wouldn't we see more of a benefit in your Paint Stores Group?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, I think the -- Glidden has in fact, over the last several years, been reducing their store count in North America. I think you see in some pockets where there was a Glidden store of some volume gains that we'd see that spread over the stores that are in that same market. Again to Bob's point, these big commercial store locations that would be gathering business from that are still feeling the impact of the slower nonresidential market out there. So the repaints for institutional and commercial properties are lagging in the construction for both new res and new commercial is lagging. And we're weathering through that storm at the same time that we're able to generate our own substantial earnings improvement.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Trey Grooms of Stephens Inc.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc.", "Yes, this is actually B.G. taking in for Trey today. I have a question on consumer promotion within the Stores group. It seems like -- we're hearing that -- through channel checks that you guys are going to be doing a little bit more promotion on consumer side. I know that two weeks ago you ran a 3-day sale nationwide. It was 40% off on all stains and paints, which I believe was a lot higher than what you had previously been running. We're also hearing that the frequency of these promotions might be occurring more often. So just wanted to get your thoughts on -- if that is in fact the case and then also kind of what you're seeing were the results of that?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, I think Bob briefly commented that we have seen a really nice rebound in our DIY business to our stores platform. That really began sometime in the middle of 2010. And the company did adopt a little bit more of an aggressive promotional stance at that point in time in an attempt to trigger buy and we have found that the DIY consumer particularly in this downturn is a little bit more sensitive to price promotions. And so we've implemented a little bit more of aggressive program there. Stains and paints off, percentage off, has been typically the way that we've gone at that. The percentages off have been pretty consistent throughout our promotional history, so 40% is not dramatically out of line with what we've done historically. And starting a little bit earlier this year than we might have in the past, our first quarter promotion, the one you're referencing that we ran a few weekends ago is a little bit early for us, but throughout the remainder of the year, these will be fairly consistent, pretty much lined up with exactly the same kind of promotional periods we had in 2010. And I don't think this is any significant shift in change in terms of how we market or what our expectations would be. Suffice to say, that the margin performance that we have in this DIY business is terrific. And so generating more footsteps to the door, even at these percentage discounts, is really good business for the company.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Great. Just a follow-up question related back to the TiO2. Can you guys get into just how you typically contract? Is that 90 days? I'm hearing in the industry there may be some changes there. Can you just comment on how -- that contract, I guess?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think that this has changed over the last decade or so. It used to be you would contract your volume out at around 80% to 85%, and you'd be in the spot [ph]  Market for 10% to 15%. Now I think it's a more fluid situation. You're making agreements of how much you're going to be able to get from different people at different prices and -- we don't basically have a contract per se any more. They're probably more agreements that you look at. And so I think pricing, though, I mean, they're pretty public about when they're going out with these prices. They've also salvaged -- I've heard from different people where they say that there's 60 to 90 days for the pricing protection, which we've never said, but we've heard that they've said. And we didn't disagree with it. But whether that changes or not, we don't know. But I would say it's more on a quarterly-by-quarterly basis right now.", "B.G. Dickey - Stephens Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Greg Melich of ISI.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Thank you, guys. Two questions. First, on the SG&A, you were down about 200 bps year-over-year. Could you just tell us how much of that was from acquisitions, the way you did on gross margin, which was helpful. Then I have a follow-up on pricing.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, you know what, Greg, I don't have that in front of me, quite honestly. I mean, the only thing -- because we really didn't do much work to break that out. We note -- what we -- just like from Chris' comments, it is a large piece of it, but we don't have that broken out.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Okay. So it wasn't [indiscernible] like it was in gross margin, but also SG&A would have still been down even if you back out acquisition?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Because you gain leverage on the price.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "And if I remember in the fourth quarter call, it was too early to say whether the 8% price increase late last year was sticking and or behaving normally. Now we're a few months into it. Is it sticking? Is it behaving the way it normally does?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. That price increase went in well. In fact of all 3 price increases last year, it was probably the most effective.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Was the last one?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, the 8%.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "And does that mean then that if raws continue doing what they're doing that you could consider going earlier? Or is the fact that the volume [indiscernible] another one or is the fact that the volume remains sort of so-so in the industry that you feel like that's limiting you at all?", "Christopher Connor", "Well, we've always commented, Greg, that our pricing activity to our customers is always a raw material-driven event. So we've taken pricing in periods of declining volume in the industry as well as accelerating volumes. So that won't have that much of an impact on it. We will be paying really close attention to this continuing raw material cost index, and if it continues to run ahead of us, we'll probably have to take additional pricing.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc.", "Right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Sean, a couple of questions on the tax line and the fluctuations there. A quarter ago, I think you pointed to mid- to low-30s. It looks like you've come in closer to 28. I was wondering if you could comment on the variance there? And if I understood your comment this morning correctly, it sounds like you'd expect it to perhaps resurge in the balance of the year. I'd be curious as to what might be driving that as well?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, the way the tax rules change -- the accounting for the tax rules about 5 to 7 years ago, discrete items which used to be, I would say smoothed over the year, no longer the case. And so as discrete items come in and -- we had a couple of discrete items come in, in the last two weeks of March that caused us to be a little lower in the first quarter than what we originally thought. It's not a great deal, but because the first quarter, the profit before taxes, the lowest number of all four, when you get a discrete item, the effective tax rate could change dramatically with the same dollar amount in the first versus the second versus the third. But you're right. When we said there look at our full year, what we think and the guidance we gave, which is the low-30s, that will tell you that our tax rate's going to be over 30, when you put the last three quarters together.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Okay. And then a second question if I may for Chris on the Consumer segment. I apologize in advance. It might be tough to answer because it's a bit general. But with regard to the prior loss at Wal-Mart, do you see today attractive opportunities to replace that volume in a counterpunching sort of fashion? Or is that perhaps sub-optimal and better to remain disciplined given the sacrifices you might need to make to do that?", "Christopher Connor", "Well, Kevin, I'm a specialist at answering generalist questions, so don't worry about that. Obviously, we are selling into a really consolidating retail customer base there. There are just a handful of people upscale left in that industry versus a decade ago where there were dozens and dozens of fairly robust regional home center chains and we really have a consolidated group. We have been very consistent in our comments that we have compelling products and brands and opportunities we think to add real value to one of those major players. We continue with an aggressive calling effort on them constantly. They're good customers of us today with our Minwax and Thompson and Krylon and other products that we sell into them. And if there was ever an opening, we'd be happy to fill it. What's the caveat to your point of maintaining our discipline here. So we have a growth strategy in this company in North America through our own Paint Store channel that provides us a lot of runway ahead. But we'd be happy to be a partner with one of these folks under the right circumstances. Time will tell.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Chris, repeatedly we've been hearing more and more about the marine business in your report as one of the stronger industrial coatings areas. Can you talk about that a little bit what's driving it?", "Christopher Connor", "Our protective and marine business has been performing nicely over the last several quarters. I think we have talked consistently with the street relative to the fact that in down cycles, this is an area that maintenance really can't be deferred for long periods of time. A lot of the stimulus money that went into our country and other countries around the world is starting to wind its way into paint portions of those projects. And so we're seeing a nice lift in that business literally around the globe, both in the U.S. businesses as well as our Global Group segment. In our vernacular, Chuck, because the industry refers to it protective and marine, we're much heavier in the protective side of that than the marine side of it. So while we do have some businesses that have some application characteristics or parts of ocean going and groundwater vessel, our lift in this business is mainly coming from the protective side where we're coating steel and concrete in a corrosive environment.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. Just clear up a couple of things. The Wal-Mart business impact in the first quarter, Sean, did you say that was more or less annualized after the rest of the year.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. What I was saying is we've given you the annual number of $70 million to $80 million and that's by quarter it's relatively streamlined.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Got you. All right. Now also, I look at my notes and I could be wrong, but I thought your original guidance for CapEx was about $20 million lower for 2011. Is that the case? Have you raised CapEx guidance?", "Sean Hennessy", "We raised CapEx around $20 million. You are 100% accurate. We've looked at some of the things including possibly in our flight department that needed to be upgraded. And so with the way the industry -- that industry we might take advantage of where prices are to do a couple of things there.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Any other parts of the company that are going to get the additional capital balance?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, that's the majority of it.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. You had a -- it looks like a $4.4 million gain -- I'm looking at my notes. Yes, $4.4 million gain from an asset sale. What segment was that contained in?", "Sean Hennessy", "That's in admin. And basically that was the old paint [indiscernible] that we had in Newark in New Jersey. We had some of the entries in the fourth quarter last year. And this year was the rest of it. But that's the end of it.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "So it didn't fall through any of the three operating segments.", "Sean Hennessy", "No, not at all.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. Okay. And then the debt is up quite a bit year-over-year. All that went into working capital and inventory?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. But first of all, you have to realize we did take on quite a bit of debt, non-domestic debt, when we did those acquisitions outside the country, especially the Europeans. So we have those. And secondly, just because of the ramp up in the working capital, we were -- our cash flow, our net operating cash, was actually -- that was $153 million versus last year's approximately $100 million. So the working capital demand made us have a little more debt on the books.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. And then last year, in the quarter, we had added back -- or for our purposes, we added back $0.08 as nonoperating guidance mainly for that debt retirement cost or debt repurchase cost you did in the second quarter. Anything like that going on in the second quarter of this year we should be aware of or even all the rest of the year?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, not at all. I think that that's -- we don't see anything to that magnitude. The other thing we did point out though is -- I know everyone added back $0.08, but we had a few things going the other way that would reduce that $0.08 that we have to go up against. But I fully -- I know where you got the $0.08.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. Thank you very much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "I just want to make sure that I understood what you were saying about the store pricing going off. It looked like if I kind of back out flattish to maybe up 1% volume growth, maybe a little bit of mix improvement as more DIY traffic come through, that pricing was up about 7%, 7.5%? Is that about the range that I should be thinking of for the rest of the year?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, you're in the range, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, very good. Secondly, on the corporate expense line, you see a lot of volatility there over the last few years. Can you give us some of kind of the bigger moving pieces that we possibly can use to forecast what your corporate expense would be?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think some of the bigger pieces that over the last couple of years we've done a few things and we've tried to do a few things. And #1 is environmental expense. And I would say that we've really made a conscious effort in the last 7, 8 years really to try to get, for a lack of a better term, no further action letters from the local and the national EPA. But some of the larger locations that we've had that we've put in our Q and if you get a chance to read the footnote regarding the environmental expenses. And so two years ago, we went down a path of a piece of property in New Jersey, Brownsburg, New Jersey that worked with EPA to try to get to the point where long term it's no longer a contingent liability. We also did it late last year with the Newark, New Jersey paint plant. We also did a lot of this work in Chicago, as well as at Emeryville. So we're hoping that in the next few years, we're going to be through the majority of those assets. So that has been in the -- caused a lot of the fluctuation. And then we've had a lot of different things in that admin line that have gone back and forth with the interest expense and some of the other things and what Chuck just mentioned. The warrants that last year in the second quarter was $0.08. And I'm sure if Chuck was still on the phone, he would tell you in the fourth quarter, there was also a piece there, so -- and then we've also taken a look at the assets. And last year, we're able to sell a couple of assets, some plants when we went through the rightsizing of the company a few years ago. There was a couple of pieces of real estate that we felt that really we didn't need anymore. So depending on where we were on the book value, we were selling different assets throughout. So the inventory of those type of assets are down. We're getting closer to the end of it. Our interest is -- I think we're done doing adjustments to our debt. So I think going forward it could be a lot less volatile than we've had in the last three to four years.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "So in terms of modeling and for quarterly purposes, can I assume that it's going to be somewhere in the low 50s?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think that's probably that. When you take a look at the full year, I think the full year, you still have to go against those warrants that Chuck mentioned in the second and fourth quarter. But I think that it's probably not that bad of a modeling.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "You also mentioned in your prepared remarks, in the second quarter, besides the accelerating raw material negative comps that you're going to see, you're also starting to annualize acquisitions and price increases. I understand the acquisition part of it, but to the extent that you got new pricing in your stores somewhere close to, let's call it, mid-single digits, 6%, 7% something like that in December, January period of 2010, which price increase annualization were you referring to? Because that sounds like it's just getting started.", "Christopher Connor", "In April 1 of last year, we took approximately a 4% price increase through our Stores business. So until we get back around April 1 of this year, we have that price increase flow into the system. There was another 4% in July and then an 8% in December. So we've been essentially operating in 3 price actions, Dmitry, over these last several months. And the most -- furthest back one of those is now going to anniversary off. So we're essentially running on two price increases then.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. I understand. Thanks. That's all the question I have. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill of Zelman and Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "A Thanks again. The one thing kind of I was hoping you could help me with, on the gross margin impact from the acquisitions, you mentioned the sequential impact. But I think that the acquisitions would've been on the majority of the fourth quarter. So I'm just trying to understand is that a seasonal difference between the core business and the acquisitions? Or why would there still be a sequential impact with that mix?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, when you take a look at -- let's go back April 1, we're also anniversarying the Sayerlack acquisition, the one acquisition. So we're going to start -- last year, the Sayerlack -- the acquisition gross margins are lower than our core. And so when you start to go up against on a comp basis we went ahead in the second quarter last year and we have in the second quarter this year.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "I know. You add this sequentially. Yes.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, when you take a look at it sequentially, the acquisitions don't have the biggest sales -- bell-shaped curve as well as our other business. Our core business in the first quarter is one of the lowest. It's at the end of the bell-shaped curve. Theirs is more of a straight line. So you're right. They're going to have more impact in the first quarter than they're going to have in the second, third or even the fourth.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "So if anything, does that mix shift then go the other way as we move into the middle part of the year because [indiscernible]...", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. [indiscernible] but you just have a larger piece of the core and a higher gross margin. And so that's why it won't have as much of an effect.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Right. Okay. And then just more generally, Chris, if you want to take this. Just commenting on the residential repaint business as you move through the quarter, did you guys see any differences? And can you talk at all -- a little bit about the spring and how the spring has opened up typical to -- versus typical seasonality?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, the first quarter, obviously, the very low quarter for res repaint, there's literally no exterior house painting season through that portion. So I think the kind of volume numbers that we've been counting on in our Paint Stores Group, particularly where we see that the majority of that business is relatively flat would indicate that it was not falling off the charts and certainly not rebounding dramatically. We're just getting into the season now. We have had some rough weather. We see that in the fact that our exterior paint sales are lagging behind where they would typically be at this time. So hopefully that's indicating some kind of demand, and we'll have a much better feel for that at the end of the second quarter, Dennis.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire", "It's Brian Maguire on for Bob this morning. Just to come back to pricing, and I know you guys don't like to tip your hand on pricing before you make the public announcement, but just thinking philosophically about how you think about pricing and has that changed over the last year? And as you said, some of your suppliers, your TiO2 suppliers have been more public in announcing their price increases and they've also been pretty open about the frequency with which they should be coming down the line in the next year or 2, periodically every 3 months or so, has that changed your thinking about your timing of announcing price increases and maybe doing them more frequently and on the basis of some kind of formula when you do see your raw material go up? And then also as the biggest architectural paint company in the U.S., is your kind of thought around being a leader on pricing in this kind of a raw material environment changed over the last year?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, I would say, Brian, that our philosophy on pricing has not changed, that again we remain a raw material-driven pricer. When we get these pressures, we've always begun with the process by pushing back to see if we can mitigate it from the supplier to us. Secondarily, what efficiencies we can bring in house to absorb it. And then third and finally, taking it to the customer base. In terms of, are we thinking about going on a more frequent timing basis, I would say 3 price increases in calendar year 2010 will be indicative of a willingness to go on a more frequent basis when the market demands us to do that. And finally, you're absolutely correct that our practice here has been to be careful about talking to our customers first and then advising the street of exactly what we've done by percentages on dates, et cetera. And at this point in time, we've not announced any additional pricing for calendar year 2011. We will be monitoring the raw material environment, and if we feel that we need to do that, we have shown in the past a discipline and the courage to get out and take the appropriate pricing when we need to. In terms of whether we're leading or following, that's never been a concern or a thought for us. Again it's really driven on where we specifically are in our raw material basket issue.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Thanks. And then one follow-up on TiO2 supply and availability. And I kind of understand the industry is running close to 100% operating rates now even in a period with demand especially in North America for architectural coatings still way below prior peaks. Can you comment on your ability to continue to get TiO2 supply if we were to have a sharp rebound in demand? It doesn't seem like it's coming in 2011, but you guys just being one of the bigger ones in the industry, I think you'd be okay. But how firm are those contracts? I know you're having discussions.", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, I think Sean's comment on the notion of a contract with these suppliers that really isn't perhaps the right way to think about it. However, I would tell you that we have great confidence and comfort that the titanium dioxide that we need get through this year is in good shape. No availability concerns.", "Brian Maguire", "And beyond this year? A little out...", "Christopher Connor", "That's a little further out than we have -- our relationships, our negotiations with these suppliers, I would expect that these folks will be able to keep pace with us for the foreseeable future.", "Brian Maguire", "Okay. Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from Greg Bernard [ph] of UBS.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Say, I was wondering if you would comment on the game plan to get the margins up on these -- the acquisitions that you went through 2010. Several times in the call you mentioned their contribution to revenue and then their contribution to EBITDA was quite disproportionate. So I mean, are you expecting improvement with the market? Is there some self-help programs that you're going to do? Could you walk me through that a little bit, please?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think what we've mentioned in the past, when you look at this wood business, this wood coatings business, the product finishes, we lump Sayerlack, we lump -- when we look at this business we talk about Inchem, Becker and Sayerlack acquisitions over the last few years. And over time, we think that we've looked at the infrastructure and we've looked at the type of sales they're making through these facilities, and we think that most of it is wood, but there's some opportunities for other substrates, whether that be plastic or metal. And when we -- as we do a few more acquisitions, when you take a look at some of the other things that we've done over Europe, we think that over time, we're going to be able to put more products through these plants, and we're going to get the sales up. The gross profit percents may not grow dramatic, never get to the exact position where we are in our core, but we think they -- it will run at a lower SG&A as a percent of sales and eventually, we can get up the margins. What we've talked about is that when we do an acquisition in the United States, when you think about Duron, MAB, Columbia, even smaller ones like VHT, over time, we can do those relatively quickly. We're just start hitting the margins up 12 to 15 months. What we've said is our game plan is going to be a little bit longer because we don't have the other assets in Europe or Southeast Asia that will do it. So we think a little -- it's going to take us a little more time, probably almost double the 15 months that it takes us inside the United States, but eventually, we'll get there.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. There are no restructuring options that could accelerate that process?", "Christopher Connor", "Yes, there is restructuring opportunities, Greg, and we were less than a year into these acquisitions and there's all kinds of integration activities underway, and consolidations and those will continue to run for a while. And typically, when you first undertake those, there's a cost associated with them, but you would see the lift in the backside of it. So we're still very optimistic about these acquisitions. They're performing ahead of our expectations at this point in time, and they will be a contributor.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Okay. Thank you very much, all.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Wells.", "Robert Wells", "Thanks, Jackie. I'd like to close today by reminding you that our annual financial community presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 at the Waldorf Astoria in Midtown Manhattan. If you have not signed up but would like to attend, there's still time. Send me an e-mail at rjwells@sherwin.com, and I'll reply with a link to our registration site. We'd love to see you there.

I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thank you, Claudia. As always, in order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website, at sherwin.com, under Investor Relations third quarter press release. ", "Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2011 versus third quarter 2010, consolidated net sales increased $312.7 million or 14.4% to $2.48 billion due primarily to selling price increases, acquisitions and improved organic volume growth by our Paint Stores Group and Global Finishes Group. ", "Acquisitions increased consolidated net sales 4.1% in the quarter, and favorable currency translation rate changes added 1% to net sales. ", "Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $66.7 million to $1.04 billion. Gross margin decreased 290 basis points to 41.8% of sales from 44.7% in the third quarter last year. ", "The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to higher year-over-year raw material costs and the dilutive effect of acquisitions completed during the past 12 months.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 8% to $760.2 million due primarily to incremental SG&A from acquisitions, higher service costs resulting from increased sales and currency translation rate changes. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 30.6% in the third quarter this year from 32.4% last year. ", "Interest expense decreased $858,000 compared to third quarter last year, and consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $4.9 million or 1.9% to $250.3 million. ", "Profit before tax as a percent of sales decreased to 10.5% from 11.8% last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 30.9% compared to 31.4% in the third quarter of 2010. ", "For the full year 2011, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30% range, excluding any impact of the IRS settlement, compared to last year's rate of 31.8%. ", "Consolidated net income increased $4.6 million to $179.9 million compared to $175.3 million in the third quarter of 2010. ", "Net income as a percent of sales declined to 7.2% from 8.1% in the third quarter last year. ", "Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 6.9% to $1.71 per share from $1.60 per share in 2010. Acquisitions and favorable currency translations combined had no significant impact on diluted net income per common share in the quarter.", "Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter increased 10.2% to $1.42 billion. Selling price increases and improving domestic architectural paint sales volumes across most customer segments accounted for most of the increase in sales. ", "Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 8.2% in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year. ", "Regionally, in the quarter, our Southwest division led the sales performance, followed by Midwest division, Southeast division and Eastern division.  Sales by all 4 Paint Stores divisions increased in the third quarter compared to last year.", "Segment profit for the group increased $11.8 million or 5.2% to $236.9 million in the quarter as sales growth from selling price increases and volume improvement was partially offset by higher year-over-year raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margin decreased to 16.7% from 17.5% in the third quarter last year. ", "Turning to our Consumer Group, sales in the third quarter increased 3.3% to $351.6 million due primarily to selling price increases that were partially offset by the elimination of a portion of a paint program with a large retail customer.", "Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $18.7 million or 31% in the quarter to $41 million due primarily to higher year-over-year raw material costs that were partially offset by selling price increases and reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses.", "Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 11.7% from 17.5% in the same period last year.", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 31.2% to $714.4 million in the quarter due primarily to acquisitions, selling price increases, higher paint sales volume and favorable currency translation rate changes. ", "In the quarter, acquisitions increased Global Finishes Group net sales in U.S. dollars by 16.3%, and favorable currency translation rate changes increased sales in U.S. dollars by 3.2%. ", "Third quarter segment profit increased $11.6 million or 36.3% to $43.5 million. Higher paint sales volume, price increases, good expense control and favorable currency rate changes were partially offset by higher raw material costs and the negative effect of acquisitions. ", "Currency rate changes increased segment profit by $3.6 million, while acquisitions reduced segment profit by $2.5 million. ", "As a percent to external net sales, segment profit increased to 6.1% in the quarter compared to 5.9% in the third quarter last year as selling price increases and higher sales volume outweighed the increase in raw material costs.", "Turning briefly to the balance sheet. Our total debt on September 30, 2011, was $1.169 billion compared to $1.066 billion in the third quarter of 2010. ", "Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $46 million compared to $64.9 million at the end of third quarter last year. ", "Total borrowings to capitalization were 41.7% at the end of the quarter versus 39.4% at the end of the third quarter 2010.

", "Long-term debt to capitalization was 23.2% at the end of the third quarter this year compared to 26.3% last year.", "In the third quarter 2011, we spent $28 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $38 million, and amortization expense was $10.1 million. ", "For the full year 2011, we anticipate capital expenditures will be approximately $150 million to $160 million, depreciation will be approximately $150 million and amortization will be about $30 million. ", "I'll conclude my remarks for the quarter with a brief update on our status on Lead Pigment Litigation. ", "On September 8, 2011, the Mississippi Supreme Court, in an 8-0 decision, overturned the jury verdict in the Gaines case and rendered judgment in favor of Sherwin-Williams. Previously, a jury had awarded the plaintiff $7 million for alleged injuries claimed to having resulted from ingesting Sherwin-Williams lead-based paint. The plaintiff asked the court to reconsider its decision, however, we believe it is unlikely the court will change its unanimous ruling. ", "That concludes my review of our third quarter results, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us. I think our third quarter results were encouraging in many respects, and I'll elaborate more in a moment, but first, let me take a few minutes to address the 8-K we filed last night. ", "Following the market close yesterday, we announced that we reached a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service regarding their audit of our employee stock ownership plan for the 2003 through 2009 tax years. You may recall from the 8-K we issued back in May, as well as the subsequent note in our second quarter 10-Q, Sherwin-Williams received a notice of proposed adjustments from the IRS, challenging certain ESOP-related federal income tax deductions and proposing substantial excise taxes and penalties. The settlement announced yesterday fully resolves all IRS issues relating to federal and state income taxes, including interest, though will result in an after-tax charge totaling approximately $75 million or $0.72 per common share and a reduction in shareholders' equity of approximately $51.2 million, both of which will occur in the fourth quarter. These charges were not included in Sherwin-Williams' previous fourth quarter and full year 2011 earnings guidance.", "Although we do not believe the deductions in question violated any tax laws, we firmly believe this resolution is in the best interest of our shareholders. This is a one-time charge that will increase our effective tax rate for the current year only and will not affect rates in future years. ", "Importantly, this settlement avoids the potential for years of management distraction and eliminates future risk and uncertainty.", "Third quarter 2011 was a record quarter for Sherwin-Williams. Revenues of $2.48 billion make this the largest sales quarter in our company's 145-year history, and $1.71 per share is an all-time high watermark for earnings per share in any quarter. ", "I think the most encouraging aspect of our results was the progress we\u2019ve made in growing sales and volume. After backing out acquisitions and favorable currency, consolidated sales were up more than 9% in the quarter, and volumes increased both sequentially and compared to last year. ", "All 3 segments reported higher year-over-year revenues, and Paint Stores Group and Global Finishes Group delivered solid organic volume growth.", "On our last call, we've said we expected domestic market conditions to improve in the second half compared to the first and that market volume would likely turn positive. Even assuming modest improvement in the market, the sales and volume performance of our Paint Stores Group in the quarter is convincing evidence that our continued investments in new store openings and superior store staffing is translating into market share growth. ", "Our strategic investments outside North America are also bearing fruit. For the third quarter and 9 months of 2011, our Global Finishes Group recorded positive volume growth across all lines of business. ", "SG&A spending increased $56 million in the quarter, however, our core SG&A expense, net of acquisitions, was up a little more than half that amount. Most of this core increase supported new stores opened in the past 12 months. The balance went towards maintaining staffing levels in existing stores and funding organic growth in our Global Finishes Group.", "In total, we reduced year-over-year SG&A as a percent of sales by 180 basis points, which partially offset the significant increase in raw material costs. ", "Our disappointment in the quarter is that we're still being impacted by the rapid increase in raw material costs. The recent decline in petrochemical feedstocks, such as propylene, will provide some cost relief in the coming quarters. However, the pricing actions by the titanium dioxide producers are likely to continue for the balance of the year and in to 2012. ", "Despite our efforts to help offset these higher input costs, including around the price increases that went into effect in early October, the lag between raw material cost inflation and higher effective pricing has pressured our gross margin in the second and third quarters and will again in the fourth. ", "Implementation of our price increases is progressing as expected, and we remain confident that we will ultimately close the gap on input costs, but our margin results in the interim are nonetheless disappointing. ", "Although the input cost headwinds continue to suppress our earnings, we managed working capital efficiently and generated strong net operating cash in the quarter. ", "In the third quarter, we generated $338 million in net operating cash compared to $241 million in the third quarter last year, bringing our 9-month net operating cash to $446 million. The increase in the third quarter cash was primarily due to $100 million reduction in working capital. Nine-month free cash flow, net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $233 million. We continue to invest the company's cash to expand our control distribution platform, complete appropriate acquisitions, increase our dividend and purchase shares of stock for treasury. ", "During the quarter, we bought back 2.64 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $74.26, bringing our year-to-date total to 4.24 million shares. ", "On October 19, last week, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization for an additional 20 million shares.", "In the first nine months, our Paint Stores Group added 31 net new stores, 13 of which were opened in the third quarter. This brings our total store count in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean to 3,421 stores compared to 3,368 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for Paint Stores Group at approximately 60 net new store locations during the year. A number of store closings in the year will be more in line with our typical low to mid-single-digit pace.", "On July 1, we completed the acquisition of Leighs Paints based in Bolton, England. Although relatively small in annual revenues, Leighs brings some very important technology to our global protective and marine product lines. Leighs is a market leader in intumescent or fire-protective coatings. When applied to structural steel or concrete, these coatings prolong the building structural integrity in a catastrophic fire, which provides more time for evacuation. Intumescent coating specifications are increasing globally, and we have high expectations for this new addition to the Sherwin-Williams family.", "While it appears that overall, architectural demand in most market segments in the Americas and global demand for most industrial coatings should remain positive over the balance of the year, raw materials will remain a challenge for the foreseeable future. ", "Our outlook for the fourth quarter 2011 is for consolidated net sales to increase 6% to 10% compared to last year's fourth quarter. We expect fourth quarter diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.87 per share before the one-time charge of $0.72 per share relating to the IRS settlement, all compared to $0.67 per share in 2010. ", "For the full year 2011, we expect consolidated net sales to increase in the low-teens percentage range compared to last year. With annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our 2011 full year guidance for diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $4.65 to $4.85 per share before the IRS settlement or in a range of $3.93 to $4.13 per share due to the settlement compared to $4.21 per share earned in 2010.", "Finally, last week, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.365 per share, up from $0.36 last year, which completes our 33rd consecutive year of increased dividend. ", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Stephen East with Ticonderoga Securities.", "Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "Chris, if we look at the TiO2 outlook, what you talked about, I appreciate the commentary. One, what are you all seeing coming through the pipeline, and two, what type of alternatives do you all have? And I know we've talked about this in past quarters, but are you to the point where there are other sources that can move the needle or different formulations, that type of things?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think we've commented, Stephen, that our expectations for the industry is that raw materials would finish for the year somewhere in the high teens, the low 20% range. Clearly, titanium has been the driver primarily of that growth this year, and we see numbers from other analysts in the range of around 40% year-over-year pricing in titanium. I don't think much change is in this forecast relative to how the year tracks regarding those numbers. 2012 remain to be seen, the amount of pricing, but from my earlier comments, you can see that we expect to be dealing with titanium price increases going into next year. Sherwin-Williams, our competitors and other raw material suppliers have all spoken about various replacement technologies, but I think the reality is that our industry is going to be relying primarily on this important raw material for a long period of time to get to come [ph].", "Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "From a geographic perspective, are you seeing alternatives in sourcing that could make a difference in 2012?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Again, I think we've talked publicly about some of the emerging titanium producers and technologies around the world, and some of those are, in fact, winding their way into our operations. But again, I don't think there's substantial enough volumes to make a significant difference in the overall market environment.", "Stephen F. East - Ticonderoga Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the other question I have is on the consumer side. Your margins got pushed down quite a bit. Is this -- do you see it as a lack of pricing power or just really trailing, having a much longer time in getting those pricing through?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, Stephen. This is Sean Hennessy. Just talking about the consumer margins in the quarter, one of the things that happened this year is we really changed the production plan and really front-loaded our production plan for the year, which resulted in higher inventory in the first and second quarter. And what happened in the third quarter is our inventory in this area came down. It was reduced. So usually, you'll see that in the fourth quarter. So what happens is that in the third quarter, our inventory production plan was lower versus last year's third quarter, so the operating margin was depressed in the third quarter. And our fourth quarter margin will not drop sequentially at the same rate as last year's. Couple other effects of that was the cash. You saw, as Chris made his notes, cash was up over $100 million, and that was a direct -- correlated exactly to the same issue.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "This is Dan Jester sitting in for P.J. I just want to talk a little bit about the sort of segments of your business that are more industrial-focused, like maybe product coatings or protective marine. Have you seen any slowdown sort of given what we've seen in the broader economy over the past few months?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, Dan, those businesses are performing fine for the company. They tend to be more at the higher end of the kind of volume numbers that we've been talking about.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then in terms of the price increase you announced in October, could you just give us a sense of how large that is? And then looking back to the June price increase, how much of that has been implemented, and can you give us a trajectory for how you expect the rest of that price increase to go through?", "Christopher M. Connor", "The October price increase was announced through our stores organization. I think as the investment community know, that's the one that we're usually the most transparent on. The pricing was around 8% to 9%. That's on top of pricing taken, as you mentioned, earlier in the year. In fact, this was the fifth price increase that we've taken in the last 20 months. All told, those 5 price increases cumulatively amount to just shy of around 30%. Historically, our net effective tax -- net effect of price increase has been in the 75% range of what we've gone out for. This last price increase is off to a good start and tracking right in line with those past historic performances.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Bob Court with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Brian Maguire on for Bob. Just on that last question on the price increases, one of your peers talked earlier this week about some price fatigue setting in with customers, and you mentioned this is the fifth price increase in the last 20 months. And I'd imagine those conversations get harder each time. What are you kind of seeing in the channel, maybe more in the consumer business than in your own stores? How are your customers downstream adjusting to all these, and how much of the announced price increases do you expect to get going forward?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I'll take the first half of this, and then I'll let Sean comment as well. Clearly, there's price fatigue. There's price fatigue on our part as well dealing with the raw material cost pressures that keep coming in. The frequency of the pricing activities that we've just talked about, again, as a reminder, is through our stores organization, so we don't take pricing as frequently to some of the other customer segments. We tend to go in smaller increments and more frequently, and I think as we've shared with the investment community over the years, the unique business model that we have servicing professional painting contractors and through our own stores, we strive [ph] a little better, run the market for us to implement them. Sean, I know you got some thoughts as well.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. I think we need to take a look at -- I'd just like to point out a couple of numbers. If you look at the operating margins, really, in the stores group, we were down 8/10 in the third quarter, but for the 9 months, we're 2/10 below last year. I do think that there probably is some fatigue, but I think that gives you some comfort that pricing is going through and we're managing through that. ", "And again, when you take a look at the consumer margins, as Steve asked earlier, our margin year-to-date is down over 300 basis points. But I think that's going -- again, that was due to some timing of production and inventory. By the end of the year, I think that will be tremendously closer than it is today. So I think those numbers give you some kind of comfort that we're really starting -- we're still able to have pricing power in the market.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just a follow-up on the inventories. How are your levels now compared to kind of normal seasonality, and would you expect to be doing some more prebuying or differentiated normal seasonal patterns on your inventory build if you expect raw materials to continue going up? Is there any thought of maybe taking advantage of the seasonal slowdown in the industry and building some inventories in the fourth or first quarters?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, finished goods inventories, when you go back 2 years, really, because last year, we had different kinds of finished goods inventory problems. But if you look at it compared to 2 years ago, we feel pretty good about our finished goods inventory. With the reduction in the third quarter, we're probably real close to where we should be. Raws, on the other hand, are slightly higher, and I think you pointed that out. And I would suggest that we're going to run high until we start to see the raw materials turn. And that's how we're managing that. But I think you're going to see raw materials higher in the short term.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to get at little bit more into the timing of the progression of gross margin. If you look in the quarter, how much of the sequential 100 bps gross margin was the production issue? Was that basically all of the issues, Sean?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, but it was the majority when you look at that 100 basis points. And I think that what we look at in the third quarter was -- that's really going to be the lowest gross margin that we'll report on a quarterly basis this year. And we actually think that sequentially, you'll see our gross margin rise in the fourth quarter. And If I was to give you a forecast, we're at 42.7. Year-to-date, I think we'll get close to the low end of the range that we talked about, the 43 to 46.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And the fourth quarter, qualitatively, that progression improvement, is that coming from the production shift, or does it actually come from the raw material pricing playing out the way it should?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would say it has a lot to do with the pricing. As Chris has mentioned, we just put a price increase the first week in October in stores, but we are going to have some positive because it's going to basically -- we had to take the positives or the negatives some time with the production plan. We took it in the third quarter versus fourth last year, so that will help us in the fourth quarter.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And if I can have just one more question on the acquisition, I think in the past, you talked about adding maybe $450 million in total sales, but we lost a little money in the quarter related to acquisitions. Is that $450 million still the right number? Is there a sign of any volume shifts in Europe, in particular, that should be aware of?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, that's a good number, Greg. We're tracking right on it.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think the loss, Greg, really, when you take a look at it, came from the acquisition we completed in the third quarter, the acquisition, the inventory step-up and so forth. Really, 100% of the loss actually came from the lease acquisitions that Chris mentioned during his comments.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky with North Coast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Chris, when you look at the pricing resistance issue a little more, can you differentiate between how architectural contractors are dealing with paint price increases versus industrial contractors, especially in North America?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I don't think there's a lot of difference between the 2, Chuck. I think we're blessed with a customer, in both of those segments, who appreciates quality materials. They're loyal to that, have a higher labor component to a finished job and just the material cost. For the most part, pricing actions across both those segments are tracking as they have historically for us.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And then following up on the volumes, could you talk about in Paint Stores and Global where you saw the volume increases, which end markets were strongest, and can you be a little more quantitative about how high volumes did increase?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I'll give you kind of a color on the segments and customer pieces, then I'll let Sean comment a little bit on just to get you closer in kind of the numbers. In terms of the stores business, as you know, we break out DIY as one big group. Within the contractor segment, we break out pretty much across all the other pieces, parts. ", "And as we've been commenting for some time, the residential repaint activities are the strength of the market. We've seen that. Obviously, DIY is essentially a residential repaint market in and of itself, but the painting contractor segment that's focused on that has continued to show some signs of strength for the company. We were pleased to see some growing signs of vital strength in the other segments. We've commented earlier in the year regarding the importance of property management. We're actually seeing some of our commercial repaint activity pick up as well, and the protective and marine has been fairly strong for the company throughout the year. The one segment, obviously, that remains a little bit of a lagger would be in that new residential area.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. And when you look at the stores group, we were up 10.2% for the quarter, comp store growth about -- we were up 8.2%, Chuck. When you take a look at it, we feel pretty good about where we are with the selling prices. But as Chris mentioned, as some of the segments have changed, you're starting to see not a mix change by customer. Customers, they're not changing the mix, but because of that, it does change how much the average selling price will increase just because of different bases. But our selling price increases in the mid -- in that 5% to 7% -- 4% to 6% selling price increase in the quarter, then there's a little difference on the on the comp stores gallon gain.", "Christopher M. Connor", "And then just to conclude the question, Chuck, regarding the Global Finishes Group, all 3 segments that we report there, product finishes, vehicle refinish and the protective segment, all were very comparable and very nice solid gallon performance and the strong revenue that we already commented on.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "And just to go back to Paint Stores, so taking 4% to 6% away from the comp number gives us some comp volume growth?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. And would you see that level of volume, similar level of volume growth in the Global Finishes segment?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Christopher M. Connor", "At least.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Eugene Fedotoff with Longbow Research.", "Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC", "Can you comment on the trends that you see in the markets and the global group, particularly in Brazil and Mexico? And also, if you can comment on the performance of your newly acquired businesses in Europe and your expectations for the businesses in fourth quarter.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think we've talked about the Latin American market, where Brazil and Mexico reside. It's embedded in that Global Finishes Group, which, as we indicated, was at the high end of our sales performance of our 3 segments. And the Brazilian and Mexican businesses are very much in line with the kind of numbers that we commented on. I think regarding the acquisitions, specifically, we don't break them out individually. There was an earlier caller that asked us if we were on track around this $450 million impact, and we said we were. So I think, Eugene, these are all kind of performing on pro forma and as expected.", "Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then on the price increases, Chris, you said that you announced 8% to 9% price increase in October. Just wondering if you're playing -- if this price increase is going to be enough to close the gap if raw materials and pricing cost start to stabilize here and there, too, may continue to increase? Or are you playing for additional price increases towards the end of the year or maybe early next year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think Sean commented earlier that we felt that by year-end, we would probably be in the range of the margin guidance that we've provided for a while now, in the 43% to 46% range. Historically, the company has operated at the peak of that range, and we're guiding that we'll probably be in the lower half of it. So that would indicate that we don't have all the pricing required to be back at the historic level. The company does not comment on perspective pricing actions, and we'll wait to see how the market responds on a number of fronts and give guidance to the street if and when we decide to take more pricing in the coming year.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "So first of all, on the volume front, I think the store volumes were down 2 or 3 points in the second quarter and up 3 points roughly in the third quarter. Can you just provide a little more color in terms of what changed and then also if this up 3% is kind of the new volume run rate we should assume as we head into 4Q and perhaps into '12? If you talk there, that would be great.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, Eric, I think just to remind everyone, last year, we felt that the government put a program out for new homebuyers that really pulled some sales forward. If you remember, and I'll remind everyone, March was very strong and April was very strong. May was very strong. And then you started to see the slippage in the third or fourth quarter. From our standpoint, we believe that the total year volume was probably not affected, but what happened was the timing of that, we had to go forward. This year, we are going against that. In the first and second quarter, we went through that and, as you said, really caused that decrease. ", "Having said that -- and we think that fourth quarter will look a lot like the third quarter. Having said that, when we talk about sequentially and so forth, we still feel pretty good about the second quarter volume in the stores group. Second to third quarter, we think that there was some increases there. But we think that just because of the major dramatic changes that that program caused in the second and third quarter last year caused major portion of the negative to positive.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then secondly, Sean, can you explain -- I understand how the consumer downtime hurt the margin in the third quarter. I guess I don't understand why you then produced more in the fourth quarter now that you've made this progress with inventory.", "Christopher M. Connor", "We don't.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We don't. What happened -- once we've got our inventory down, you're not going to see it come down, but what happens is when your inventory comes up the balance sheet, your expensing that conversion in a different quarter than what you produced it, and that's what happens to us this year. And that's why I think that when you see the quarterly -- last year, our drop between the third and fourth quarter in the Consumer Group went from 17 down to 10. You're not going to see that same dramatic decrease of the 11.7 that we produced this third quarter.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "But that's on a sequential basis. On a year-over-year basis, it's going to look similar. It just won't drop sequentially. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think that -- I usually don't do this, but I would tell you that the segment probably will have a higher operating margin in the fourth quarter, even with the raw material headwind.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Why is that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Because of this drop that we took in the third quarter that won't repeat in the fourth.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then lastly, on gross margin, do you have visibility ability -- or how should we think about, understand the 43% to 46% range? At what point do we get to where we have stabilization in gross margin on a year-over-year basis?", "Christopher M. Connor", "So a lot of this, Eric, is obviously predicated on the raw material costing environment. So if you can answer that part of the formula [indiscernible], we'll tell you where we're going to stabilize. As you know, we're going to continue to put pricing into the market on the heels of raw material cost pressure to us, and so it's going to take some time for us to recover.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill", "The first question, the effect of raw materials as we think about '12. Chris, I think you said we'll see -- kind of you're not sure where some of the forecasts go, but just given where cost and how cost plays in this year, if you just held sort of raw material cost constant, what would that sort of imply for the basket next year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think that, Dennis, to that point, if we were unable to freeze raw material cost right where they are today, we'd still see a mid-double-digit kind of price increase next year, in the teens.", "Dennis McGill", "A mid-double-digit increase on the raw materials side?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes.", "Dennis McGill", "Yes, okay. And then sort of separately, and I'm not sure how much you want to get into the details of kind of competitor actions, but realizing one of the home centers pushing more aggressively into the pro side or the paint  [indiscernible] and seen increased presence of -- maybe going after your contractors. Can you just talk about how you guys think about that as a competitive threat, whether these are different types of contractors that might be doing multiple things as opposed to just paint or other ways to kind of frame that versus any other threat you usually see in the market?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Sure. Well, we have terrific respect for all the big-box competitors that are in this space. We have watched for decades, essentially, Dennis, and see the same demographic shift toward the paint that we've watching in a number of initiatives and programs that have been introduced to attract that customer into their footprint. It's incumbent upon Sherwin and the other operators of the specialty paint store chains to continue to do the things to keep that customer loyal to our channel. I think those actions are afoot. You see that simply as we continue to open more and more convenient store locations, as well as the caliber and the talent we put inside the store and the technology and the product that's being introduced. ", "So all those things continue to keep this customer loyal to the channel. Having said that, we think that these are very compelling competitors, and we have to continue to pay attention. You make reference to the more -- not so much the painting contractor, specifically, but more of the remodeling contractor or what we sometime refer to as the handyman, who might be buying multiple home improvement products, not just in the same category, and that's a more appropriate customer [indiscernible]. We think that's happening, and time will tell where these all shakes out. We remain committed to being the retail location and choice for the professional painting contractor, and we like our chances going forward.", "Dennis McGill", "And you said that you can measure volumes in the quarter at least holding share. Do you feel comfortable with that sort of 30% volume is similar to the market or better than the market?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "With regard to your protective and marine coatings business, can you advise us how that would split in terms of OEM versus repaint and also how protective per se versus marine? I would've thought you'd see a little volume pressure on the marine side, but it looks like it's netting out to positive.", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, that's been a pretty solid category for us, Kevin. And as with the architectural business, the amount of new build -- or the degree to which new build is driving that category is way down. So normally, it could be as much as 20% of volume going into new build. We would suspect that in this environment, it would be close to half of that, maybe 10% to 12%. The repaint side, the recoat side is the piece of the business that's holding up quite well.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "How would it split, Bob, between protective and marine?", "Robert J. Wells", "The market, I'm not sure of the split in the market. In our business, we are skewed very heavily toward protective.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Sean, with regard to the board's new authorization of an additional 20 million shares to be repurchased, can you comment broadly on the expected pace of execution there relative to your old 30 million authorization put forth in October of '07? Is there any reason to believe it would be different over a multiyear period?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I'm glad you mentioned that '07 because this 20 million is really not anything new to this management team. We also received 20 million in 2005 and 2003. So it's been an ongoing program. I think the way we've been purchasing the stock is pretty consistent to what you're going to see in the future. I think that it's not that we're always trying to do 4%. But it's interesting, when you look over the 10-year period, annually, it's been at least 4% every year. I think that, again, the cash we're producing, we're going to be looking for acquisitions or the dividends are important to us, the CapEx and, and where there are acquisitions, you're going to still see us buying stock. And as Chris mentioned, one time in -- 41 straight quarters, we've purchased stocks. So I think you'll still see us in the market every quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Chris Nocella with Barclays Capital.", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just going back to the question on volumes. Given your architectural coatings you're managing for many years now, how do you think of the potential for pent-up demand given that people have delayed remodeling projects? So basically, do you see the potential for higher volume even if the housing market turnover specifically remains pretty depressed?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Chris, we have been commenting that the residential repaint market will be rebounding and, as Bob said, mainly on the maintenance side, and a good part of that is because of this pent-up demand. The number that I can maybe share with you that will give you some comfort around that is that we've been talking about the U.S. architectural coatings industry at its peak 4 years or so ago, produced 800 million gallons, and that number's dropped to just below 600 million  gallons. ", "And if you back out the housing bubble impact, it had new home construction and new commercial construction kind of in more normalized historic run rates, not bubble rates. The industry should be somewhere in the 725 million to maybe as high as 750 million gallons. So we think that as the new construction comes back, it doesn't account for all that growth in 600 million to mid-700s. There's obviously pent-up demand on maintenance, both residential and some commercial as well, and I think that will be the strength of this market for the next several years.", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And as those volumes improve, how do you think of the need to add cost in this environment?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I'm sorry. I didn't really get the relationship there. Can you ask the question again, please?", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, if you have improving volumes, your need to add SG&A costs?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think when you take a look at it, there will be some incremental, really, but I think that SG&A at this level, we think that over 90% is fixed. And the reason it's so high is that we consider manpower in the store being  [indiscernible] is a fixed cost. You don't open a store without a manager, a system manager and the right staffing. So when we look at what we are able to do between 2002 and 2007 and look at the incremental -- how much we brought down to the bottom line and incremental income, we think that we could actually be slightly higher than that if it goes back up to that 725 million to 750 million range. And we think our capacity -- where we're running that capacity gives us some nice incremental flow-through.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Jeremy Brunelli with Consumer Edge Research.", "Jeremy Brunelli", "This year, we've had an unprecedented number of major weather events, Hurricane Irene, most recently, the tornadoes Midwest, et cetera. Do you have any sense of the acceleration in volumes and maybe paint projects in your domestic market, whether they have anything to do with these weather events? And then just a second question, when you look at kind of the repaint in architectural demand, is any sense that there is an increase in average project size or total number of projects that you're getting maybe from the survey work that you do at the Paint Store level?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Jeremy, first comment on the weather, I think that yes, Irene certainly impacted up and down the eastern seaboard, but as a country, we think some form of hurricane weather activity. Every year, we take various rains and snow storms, et cetera, so it's rare that the company comments on weather having either a negative or positive impact on the organization. We have seen from time to time geographically some impacts on these, but Irene has been the caliber hurricane that would have done that. Katrina moved the needle for us in the southwestern part of the United States. Various other hurricanes historically in Florida might have, but I don't  think that those things will move the needle or having an impact in the third quarter volumes that we've been talking about. In terms of the repaint projects we're seeing relative to average size or scope, I don't think there's a lot of change in that at all.", "Robert J. Wells", "The only thing I'd say on that, Jeremy, is that given that residential repaint has been where most of the strength in the market has been over the last few quarters, those tend to be smaller projects than the commercial projects. So if we see a meaningful rebound in commercial volume, that probably suggests larger product size.", "Jeremy Brunelli", "And do you have any sense that whether these are kind of projects that are done jointly with other parts of the projects, so maybe like a kitchen remodel, or are these projects mostly focused around just doing a paint project and that's it, no other aspects of the project?", "Robert J. Wells", "Well, given that large-ticket home improvement projects are down, I would say that the growth we're seeing in the residential repaint market, which has been modest, but it's been positive, are likely maintenance painting projects and redecorating projects as opposed to the tailwind of large capital improvement projects.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Silke Kueck with JPMorgan.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "On average, the volume growth on mature wins looks higher than what's reported by some of your global competitors. Can you talk about, like, where you may have gained share?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think, Silke, that clearly in the painting contractor segments that we've been talking about, we're pretty confident that this has been the share-gaining cycle that we've been through in the third quarter. We'll confirm that as well. I think our DIY performance through our stores group also has been a share-gaining performance. It's been performing right in line with these high revenue numbers that we've been commenting on through the stores, and the volume performance has been nice there as well, too. ", "Obviously, we have commented publicly about our Consumer Group's loss of a significant retail partner, so I think all in, when you look at the DIY segment, the puts and takes are probably more in the flattish area. But clearly, again these professional painting contractors across all the segments, will continue to gain share.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then in terms of raw material costs, I think you earlier said that if raw materials stayed flat where they are today, they would be up low or mid-double digits in 2012. And does that factor in any decreases in propylene cost? Because when you look at any of the projections for propylene cost, one would think that eventually, your quoted cost would be down double-digit if stay where they are today.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we don't disagree with that. But I think the question was if the raw material costs, to us, stayed consistent, where would our overall input cost be throughout calendar 2012, and that was the comment that we'd be in the low to mid-teens. If propylene turns over and we start to see that feedstock pricing comes through our raws here, this thesis is correct.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "What's normally -- I mean, anybody can look at propylene prices, so if you look at what propylene price is doing, how long it takes the quoted prices to change?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, we should be seeing the drop in propylene flowing through that portion of the raw material basket in the next quarter or 2.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Gregg Goodnight with UBS.", "Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Would you comment on -- price aside, would you comment on TiO2 availability in inventories you're  seeing out there both now and your commitments for sourcing TiO2 for the important 2012? Do you see any issues there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We've got no issues with that at all, Greg. Supply is fine for this year as well as the foreseeable future.", "Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of inventories and availability, are things fairly balanced?", "Christopher M. Connor", "In terms of our inventory?", "Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, well, your reading on the industry.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think we're fine. I don't hear any stress in the industry where we're unable to get inventory on raw materials.", "Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Second question. Bob, in terms of lead paint, is the Gaines case the final battle there, or do we -- is that the last chapter on lead paint?", "Robert J. Wells", "There are a handful of personal injury suits still pending, Gregg. I think we have one maybe in Mississippi and a couple in Wisconsin. There is also the matter of the public nuisance complaint still pending in California, which we are in a discovery phase now. And it's slated to go to trial late next year, but we'll see if we stick to that timing.", "Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. Sean, TiO2 year-over-year increases, what percentage of your year-over-year, total year-over-year raw material increase did the TiO2 contribute?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think most of the time we do talk about the basket. We still believe that the basket will increase in the high teens, low 20% range. When you take a look at that, the majority of it is that titanium dioxide.", "Gregg A. Goodnight - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Last question, if I could. The experts are talking about TiO2 price increases switching from a TiO2-constrained to an ore-constrained situation. In fact, they are talking about retail prices averaging $720 a ton this year going up to $2,000 a ton by 2013. My question to you guys is: Have you looked at the ore situation? Do you believe the ore prices could potentially fly up by a factor of 2 or 3 for the high-grade ores?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Greg, we are aware of the orefication, I would say, for the first time probably in 3 or 4 of these titanium runs that I've been involved in. We've actually been a little bit more work through, the providers of TiO2 to the ore manufacturer. So we are marginally up to speed on some of the economics that are facing that. I don't think we really have an opinion or comment on that at this point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "First question is just on your guidance. I mean, the $0.67 to $0.87 is a pretty wide range for the fourth week in October. Just wondering what put you at the top, what put you at bottom. And I know you had an improvement in volumes this quarter, but obviously, you're coming out of some tough comps in the first half. So is it volume upside you see? Is it just something breaking on price realization going through quicker than expected? Just what drives that wide range so late in the year.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, Don, really just one factor, and you're very accurate. We feel pretty good where we think the sales will come in, what we think is going to happen with the SG&A, what we think our interest expense and so forth will be. ", "It really comes down to this cost thing and how much cost will come in and the effect on our LIFO reserves for the year. That's probably the #1 reason that the range is -- the range, without that volatility in the gross margin -- really caused by the 2 things. We'll see what our costs of goods sold are in the fourth quarter. And as you know, with LIFO, that's last in, first out, so we'll see what happens. And then the LIFO reserve as well as the raws are causing that.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And then a follow-up on the Consumer Group, I guess you're close to lapping the loss of color plates business. Was that much of a volume for you in the fourth quarter of last year? Because I guess at that time, you knew that that would running off anyway. So was that part of the improvement in consumer margins as well as the comps get a little easier?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Not actually in the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter was still a fairly strong quarter for us, not only for the color plates that we were providing, but if any of the other 3 vendors had any type of issues as far as providing, we were doing the providing for their product. So fourth quarter was still a pretty good quarter for us with that Walmart business. Really, in the fourth quarter, you're going to see the annualization.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And, Chris, you've talked in the past about the potential for, perhaps, becoming a second source of supply to one of the big-boxes. Any progress there? I know in the past, there's been hang-ups over branding and things like that, but is there any update you can provide us there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, nothing to comment on that at this time, Don.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And then final question, you talked about how you've gained share. Is that a case of your gaining work of a contractor business, or do you think that this contractor versus big-box dynamic has sort of played out? And as you've said, some of the handyman and remodelers who buy from big-boxes, that's taken some share of the contractor market. So I'm just wondering whether these were just market share gains that you had or whether it's an improvement in the overall contractor big-box?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we talked publicly about the split in the market between the contractor, painting contractor purchases and all other categories, which would include DIY, primarily, but also some of this remodeler. Anybody that doesn't generate more of than 75% of their revenue from applying paint, we don't consider a painting contractor. That shift has moderated at 55% of all purchases for painting contractors. It's the second year in a row. So after seeing it fall for a couple of years due to the falloff in construction, that's moderating. ", "Relative to the shift between that and the big-boxes, we haven't seen any movement from the contractor toward the big-boxes. So the share gains that we're speaking of -- and when we talk about share, we're going into the individual segment, have we gained more share specifically against the res repaint contractor, the commercial contractor, et cetera. And that's where we told you that we're quite confident that this has been a share-gaining cycle for us against all those subsegments.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Just on a little bit further detail on the share gains. I'm just trying understand what you would see is driving that. Is this better quality, better service that you're seeing people shifting away from competitors, or is it -- would you qualify as competitors kind of saying, \"We just can't really maintain the business as it is. We don't have the control distribution. It just doesn't makes sense for us.\" or they're leaving the marketplace?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, again, speaking specifically about the painting contractor market in North America and their strong preference for the specialty paint store channel, we think during this cycle that we've seen north of a thousand locations close. That would be a small mom-and-pop, independent dealer, as well as some of the larger national and regional chains that we compete with in close locations. ", "So just on a door count alone, the share position has improved. I think when you look inside that -- in each of our calls over the last several quarters, we've talked about the strategic decision the company's made to keep staffing levels in these stores at high levels. That's why our SG&A peaked, and I think, again, that's the key component of keeping contractors loyal to that footprint. So all those things would be part and parcel of why that share shift is moving towards the Sherwin-Williams store footprint.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then with regard to overall pricing mix, next year, you said, of course, that raw materials, seeing them up even if they stayed flat in the teens. Is there any way, even as you try to get to price increases just on the raw materials side, to improve your mix so that overall, whether or not you recover your raws, you're still getting stronger pricing?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Over the course of time and through all of these, usually, we do see us a positive mix change for us on the gross margin side, as well as the -- towards the higher quality products. And then with new products, that, again, occurs. So I think that next year, we're going to be more of the same. I think we're going to see positive mix for us in 2012. And as Chris said, when you annualize where we're at just currently, you do have a raw material increase. And with the pricing that we did in October, that's going to be annualized next October. I think you're going to see price still be a good size factor for increasing sales next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question. On the consumer side, do you expect the same production trends next year, so meaning a buildup of inventory in the first half and then working it off in the second half, or do you expect to continue or go back to where it's been historically?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think right now, we're going through that planning process, and it really has to come down to what we think is going to happen to raws and so forth. But I would tell you, it's probably -- even if we repeated it, it would not be as dramatic as it is in 2011. Will we be all the way back to where we were in 2009? I don't know, but we're finalizing those plans right now, but I don't think it'll be as dramatic as this year.", "Operator", "Our last question is a follow-up from Chuck Cerankosky with North Coast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Sean, I'm looking forward, too, to 2012 about the Consumer Group. I'm just trying to get a little more input from you with the complete cycling of the business decline at Walmart and maybe a new production cycle at the Consumer Group in 2012. What should we be thinking about in terms of sales increase and the cadence of the margin shifts year-over-year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think that over time, we've talked about long term. We think it's going to be flat, up slightly. I think that when you take a look at the Consumer Group right now, probably, it's going to have a little more price than normal in next year, but I would say with a more normalized production rate. I think you're going to -- that's what I would say. In the near-term, you're going to see from consumer.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Would you expect year-over-year margin improvements in consumer?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "In 2012, yes.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Yes, versus '11?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We're working on that game plan right now, but just as company, I think we expect margin improvement. Right now, we haven't finalized the plan, but I would say that our operating team, I don't think we'd come up here without a margin improvement next year.", "Operator", "Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the floor back over to Bob Wells for closing comments.", "Robert J. Wells", "We'd like to thank you, all, for your participation on the call this morning, on this very busy reporting day for you. As always, I will be available over the balance of the day and week to take your follow-up questions. We appreciate you joining us this morning, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time all lines are in a listen only mode.  Later there will be an opportunity for your question and instructions will be given at that time.  (Operator Instructions)  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Chief Financial Officer, Ms. Lori Walker.", "Lori A. Walker ", "Welcome to our earnings conference call.  Today we\u2019ll be covering results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2011.  Gary Hendrickson our President and Chief Executive Officer is with me on our call this morning.  Before we begin I\u2019ll direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning which contains much of the information that we\u2019ll be covering in the call.  This call is subject to the forward-looking statements language contained in our press release and our comments may include forward-looking statements as that term is defined by securities law.", "This morning I\u2019ll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results.  Details are provided in the press release we issued this morning which is available under investor relations on our website at www.ValsparCorporate.com.  Gary will follow with his comments including our outlook for 2012 and then we\u2019ll respond to your questions.", "Fourth quarter sales totaled $1.05 billion, a 19.4% increase from the fourth quarter of 2010.  Adjusted for currency and acquisitions, sales were up 5%.  Adjusted net income per share for the quarter increased to $0.84 in 2011, a 50% increase from $0.56 in 2010.  Our press release includes details showing the reconciliation between our reported and adjusted results.  ", "As you saw in our press release, during the quarter we reported a non-cash impairment charge of $363.4 million, that was net of tax, for goodwill and intangibles associated with our wood coatings and gelcoat product lines.  The action is a result of our annual impairment analysis of goodwill.  As a result of that review, we concluded that the economic outlook for the end markets served by these product lines that are closely tied to US housing starts is not likely to change in the foreseeable future.", "After adjusting our forecast for these dynamics, the carrying amount for these businesses exceeded their fair value.  The charge is subject to finalizations of fair values which we will complete before filing Form 10K for fiscal 2011.  The non-cash impairment charge has no impact on the company\u2019s liquidity or our bank credit covenants.  ", "Both the wood and gelcoat product lines came with the acquisition of Lilly Industries in 2000 and performed well for the company when the US housing market was growing.  The gelcoat product line which is reported as part of other is small and not material to our overall results.  Our wood product line is part of our coatings segment.  We\u2019ve taken steps in this product line to rationalize production, lower the overall cost structure and organize the business to serve our customers well.  Looking ahead, we expect the wood product line to deliver positive earnings and cash flow.  ", "For fiscal year 2011 sales totaled $3.95 billion, a 22.5% increase from fiscal year 2010.  Adjusted net income per share increased 18.8% to $2.65 in 2011 from $2.23 in 2010.  Again, please refer to our press release for the reconciliation to our reported results.  For the fourth quarter our gross margin excluding restructuring charges in both years was 32.9% down 40 basis points from 33.3% in 2010.  Margins were impacted by rising raw material costs which were partially offset by pricing actions.  ", "Excluding restructuring charges in both years and one time acquisition fees related to Wattyl in 2010, our operating expenses as a rate to revenue were 22.1% down slightly from 22.2% in the fourth quarter of 2010.  Quarter-over-quarter operating expense dollars increased to $36 million due primarily to the addition of Wattyl operating expenses.  ", "Now, I\u2019m going to talk about our tax rate for the quarter and for the full year.  Both will exclude the after tax non-cash impairment charge.  The tax rate for the fourth quarter was 16.3% compared with a rate of 32.5% in the fourth quarter last year.  Our tax rate for the full year was 26.7% compared with 30.4% in 2010.  The improved tax rate for the quarter and the full year was due to a more favorable geographic mix of earnings and a onetime non-recurring benefit from favorable tax rulings and statute lapses.  These onetime events contributed approximately $0.09 per share to earnings in fiscal 2011.  For fiscal 2012 we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 30% to 31%.  ", "Average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 95.2 million, down 5 million from last year due to repurchases which were partially offset by options.  During the fourth quarter we repurchased 750,000 shares for approximately $23 million.  For the full year, we repurchased 6.75 million shares for approximately $242 million and have 8.25 million shares remaining under our current authorization.  We estimate average shares outstanding for the first quarter to be approximately 95 million.   ", "Recapping our sales performance for the quarter, and this is adjusted for currency and acquisitions our overall core growth was 5% driven by high single digit price increases which offset a mid single digit decline in volume.  Currency was 3.1% and acquisitions added another 11.3% for total growth of 19.4% in the quarter.  ", "Turning to our segment results, this again is adjusted for currency and acquisitions, coating segment sales increased 7.9% in the quarter and were up 10.6% for the full year.  Sales in this segment benefited from pricing and new business.  Paint segment sales increased 1.4% for the quarter and 3.7% for the year reflecting the impact of pricing.  Sales and other increased .4% for the quarter and 4.5% for the full year primarily due to pricing.  ", "I\u2019m now going to move into a discussion of our EBIT margins and all of the numbers that I\u2019ll be discussing exclude the non-cash impairment charge, restructuring and acquisition related fees.  For the fourth quarter our coatings segment EBIT margin was 15.5%, up 70 basis points from 14.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010 due primarily to pricing.  Our paint segment EBIT margin was 9.9% down 140 basis points from 11.3% in 2010 due primarily to the lag between higher raw material costs and the impact of our pricing actions.  The EBIT margin for our other category was -24.6% compared with -20% in the fourth quarter last year.  As a reminder, other includes our corporate expenses.  The total company EBIT margin for the quarter was 10.8% compared with 11% in the fourth quarter 2010.  ", "Looking at margins for the full year, our coatings EBIT margin was 13.3% down from 14.1% in 2010.  The paint segment EBIT margin for the year was 9.9% down from 13.2% last year.  The EBIT margin for other was -8.9% compared with -12.9% in 2010.  Total company EBIT margin for the year was 10.5% compared with 11.8% in fiscal 2010.  The overall change in company and segment EBIT was due primarily to the lag between higher raw material costs and the impact of our pricing actions.", "Moving to the balance sheet, our net debt at the end of the year was $859 million, a decrease of $133 million from the end of the quarter and an increase of $88 million from the end of fiscal 2010.  For the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $186 million compared with $89 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  The positive change in cash flow this quarter was primarily the result of improved working capital performance.  ", "For the full year we generated $291 million of operating cash flow compared to $266 million in fiscal year 2010.  Working capital as a rate to revenue improved 130 basis points to 13.6% which compares with 14.9% in fiscal 2010.  On a full year basis we generated $157 million in free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less cap ex and dividends and we estimate free cash flow in the range of $160 to $190 million in fiscal year 2012.  Our net debt to capital was 41.5% and we ended our quarter with $602 million of reserve liquidity and that includes $424 million in available committed credit facilities and $178 million in cash.  ", "Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $24.1 million compared with $32.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2010.  For the full year, capital spending was $66.5 million versus $67.7 million in 2010.  Our forecast for 2012 capital spending is approximately $90 million.  Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $27.1 million up from $20.1 million in the fourth quarter 2010.  Excluding $7.7 million of accelerated depreciation related to restructuring, depreciation and amortization for the full year totaled $90 million.  Our full year forecast for 2012 is approximately $90 million.", "Just a brief comment about our restructuring actions, as we detailed on our third quarter earnings call the total cost of the overall efforts will be $0.30 to $0.35 with 60% in cash and 40% non-cash.  We incurred $0.13 of the cost in Q4 for a year-to-date total of $0.24.  We expect the majority of the remaining $0.06 to $0.11 of the costs to be incurred in the first half of 2012.  The savings from these actions are included in our guidance.  As mentioned in our release we currently expect our fiscal 2012 adjusted net income per share to be in the range of $2.87 to $3.07 which excludes restructuring.  ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gary for his comments.", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "We had a good quarter.  We delivered double digit growth in both sales and earnings and we continued to perform well in all regions.  We were very pleased with our acquisitions and strong new business efforts which helped us to offset soft markets in North America and Europe and inventory adjustments by our customers in North America in our paint segment.  In our coatings segment we gained new business in all our product lines particularly in general industrial and coil.  In the paint segment sales benefited from our Wattyl acquisition and our growth in our consumer business in China.", "During the quarter we continued our pricing in all geographies and product lines and on a year-over-year basis we continue to make progress in restoring our margins.  However, we still need more pricing before our margins are fully restored.  We also did a great job in managing our cost, lowering our inventory levels and improving productivity so overall a very good quarter.  ", "Turning to the full year, we once again delivered double digit earnings growth, $2.65 per share an 18.8% increase and our third consecutive year of double digit earnings growth.  Even excluding the one-time tax benefit of $0.09 per share that Lori mentioned, our earnings per share were up nearly 15% over last year.  This was a significant accomplishment by Valspar employees worldwide given the substantially higher raw material costs and challenging market conditions in the US and Europe.", "During the year we made solid progress on our long term growth initiatives, our investment in brands, innovative technologies and strategic acquisitions.  In the US consumer awareness of the Valspar brand continues to grow and third party data indicates that we are outperforming the market.  The consumer business in China performed well and delivered another strong year.  Regarding Wattyl, we\u2019re on track with the integration in our plan to bring Wattyl\u2019s profitability in line with our corporate average.  ", "So 2011 was a good year for driving growth through our investment in brands.  Throughout the year, we were successful at securing significant new business in our coatings product lines, particularly those serving industrial markets.  We continued to deliver new technology and we achieved our target for net new business.  We also completed the acquisition of Isocoat a Brazilian based manufacturer of powder coatings that further strengthens our presence in Latin America and broadens our range of technologies for the general industrial markets.", "We made good progress towards restoring our operating margin through pricing and productivity.  We secured almost 10% in pricing globally in response to markedly higher raw materials costs.  And as we pointed out in the past there\u2019s a lag between raw material cost increases and the impact of our pricing actions and we still need more pricing.  We also took significant action to increase our cost structure and improve productivity.  Finally, we returned cash to shareholders by increasing our annual dividend per share by over 10%, the 33rd consecutive year of a dividend increase and by repurchasing 6.75 million shares.   ", "Looking ahead to fiscal 2012, our guidance is for adjusted net income per share in the range of $2.87 to $3.07 which once again represents double digit earnings growth.  The assumptions behind our performance outlook include modest sales growth driven by new business in all product lines and regions, a moderating raw material environment.  We do expect raw material inflation for the year but don\u2019t anticipate the dramatic inflation that we experienced in 2010 and 2011, and a continued focus on operational and pricing discipline along with productivity improvement which includes savings from our restructuring actions.", "With those comments, I\u2019ll open the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Saul Ludwig \u2013 North Coast Research.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 North Coast Research", "I have a couple of questions about your influence on 2012 outlook.  To what degree are earnings being helped by lower amortization of intangibles as a result of the onetime charge that you\u2019ve taken?", "Lori A. Walker ", "Not at all, there\u2019s no change to amortization.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 North Coast Research", "With regard to price versus raw, to what degree did pricing \u2013 what was your headwind?  Did price versus raw materials hurt you $20 million, $30 million, $50 million or how much and how are you thinking about that ratio in your 2012 guidance?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Let me answer it in terms of the year.  We had raw material inflation in the year of mid to high teens.  We obviously agreed to a lot of pricing with our customers in the year and we made about 85% to 90% recovery.  Net year we still have that 15% to 10% to recover which is inflation that we didn\u2019t recover in 2011 and our expectation for raw material inflation in the guidance that we gave and in our plan is for inflation somewhere around [inaudible] raw material inflation and our working estimate is mid-single digits at this point.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 North Coast Research", "Do you think that 85% to 90% recovery would be better in 2012 but not reach 100%?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "That depends on what actual inflation occurs.  We obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball and we don\u2019t know what will happen.  If raw material inflation were flat in the year I would say that we\u2019d reach close to 100% recovery in 2012.  If we have continuing inflation then we\u2019ll have obviously the normal lag that  we have as far as agreeing to pricing with our customers to cover that inflation and it wouldn\u2019t be 100%.  ", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 North Coast Research", "Then just finally, you\u2019ve been very successful with the new business, could you give us some quantification to what degree new business helped your top line and is there lags to this new business pattern?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I\u2019ll answer the second question first and say that there are lags and all of our businesses have nice plans for growth next year.  Much of that is based on technology innovations.  In the year, it was I think I mentioned on our third quarter call that our net new business was about 3% in the year and that\u2019s the number.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Prashant J. Guptar \u2013 Citi.", "Prashant J. Guptar \u2013 Citi", "If you exclude the Wattyl acquisition, it seems that the paint top line was up maybe 1% or maybe it was flat.  Can you give us a price volume breakdown that you typically do?  And then I think you said you continued to gain share in the US, does that mean at Lowes and was there any impact from PPG Olympic ONE paint?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I think we were up slightly in the paint segment overall and that\u2019s a combination of our business in China, our business in the US and several channels.  You asked me to exclude Wattyl.  Our business in China grew nicely.  Our business in the US frankly, was soft.  We think the overall market in the US, the DIY market was soft in the year.  It wasn\u2019t a great painting season, spring started late, there was unusual weather, a lot of rain during the painting season and fall came early.  So we think the overall DIY market in North America was down volumetrically in the year.", "We\u2019ve done well with our products in both the main channels that we serve and the third party data that I referenced indicates that Valspar was outperforming the markets.  But I will say we outperformed the market in a weak market. ", "Prashant J. Guptar \u2013 Citi", "Then just a quick  question on the goodwill impairment charge of $360 million, Lori it sounds like the charge was quite big compared to the total amount of goodwill which is about $1.4 billion so was a big chunk of that goodwill tied up in wood coatings alone?", "Lori A. Walker ", "Yes, and just to make it clear the charge is goodwill and intangible so if you look at the combination that was roughly $2 billion prior to the write off and yes, that is associated then primarily with the wood coatings product line.  That\u2019s the one associated with the acquisition of Lilly back in 2000.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank.", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Gary, just on raws for next year what are you forecasting for TiO2 to be up year-over-year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I don\u2019t know David, I think there\u2019s another nomination for shortly after the first of the year.  It\u2019s certainly not as significant as they have been in the past so it\u2019s possible that we\u2019ll see continued pricing from the TiO2 suppliers but I certainly don\u2019t expect it to be to the extent that we\u2019ve seen in the past.", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just on your propylene based acrylics and other resins, are you yet seeing any declines in those pricing for you guys?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "They\u2019ve come down some.  The derivatives of propylene and ethylene have come down from their highs.  I think we\u2019re forecasting for the first quarter or two that they\u2019re probably down [inaudible] that we\u2019ll see some modest depreciation of those types of products.", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Just in Q4 the sequential increase in coatings is that all recapture of pricing here?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "It\u2019s a combination of that and a fair amount of new business which is differentiated business that\u2019s coming into particularly our GI and our coil business at nice margins.", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "The last thing Gary, just the cap ex increase year-over-year can you highlight some of the major projects?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Are you talking about 2011 to 2012?", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Yes.  ", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "It\u2019s about a third maintenance, a third growth and a third what we call strategic.  So the strategic part is the most interesting part for us where we\u2019re making some substantial investments in our plants in China.  We\u2019ll be building a new plant in China to support the growth of the Huarun business and we\u2019ll be expanding two of our other plants in South China to support the growth of our industrial businesses.", "David Begleiter \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Gary why was Huarun up year-over-year in 2011?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Well, we break it into two pieces.  We break it into the consumer piece and we break it into the industrial piece.  The consumer business was up high teens in terms of revenue and the industrial business was up somewhat less than that.  I don\u2019t remember the exact number.", "Lori A. Walker ", "It\u2019s low double digits.", "Operator", "", "Your next question today comes from Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing generally in Australia?  Is that sort of a flat market and the cost take outs are driving the results or is there some thread of growth there as well?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Well, the housing market in Australia is soft.  Interest rates are high and it\u2019s not a robust housing market so the volume expectations that we had going into the year were not realized on our core business.  However, we did secure the majority of the shelf space in the new Masters Store which is a between Lowes and Woolsworth.  Five of those stores are open and they appear to be performing extremely well, certainly our paint sales are performing well.  In our model, that\u2019s the principle growth engine that we have for the first couple of years.  Relative to the cost outs, we\u2019re on track.  That was a big part of our restructuring that we did in 2011 and relative to our plan we\u2019re on track or maybe slightly ahead of our plan.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "On the resin side you guys have some vertical integration there.  Can you remind us what kind of resins you make and is that a novelty in the paint space so maybe you\u2019re seeing some quicker raw material relief than some of your competitors?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "We make two types of resins, solvent based and water based and the water based is the much larger component of it.  That business did well this year but it was challenged with volume because we\u2019re selling into the US architecture market which I said earlier was a weak market this year.  Just in terms of recovery we would not expect to see it at a faster pace than our competitors would.  It comes at more or less the same pace.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "The impairment charge on the wood coatings business, is that all the goodwill or what part of that will be asset consolidation, or closure, headcount reduction, or other restructuring efforts?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "It\u2019s 100% goodwill and intangibles.  There\u2019s no people involved, there\u2019s no cash involved, it\u2019s a balance sheet adjustment.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Then the last one for Lori, I\u2019m a little confused, I don\u2019t think I recall seeing a company that had a GAAP share count that was decidedly different from the non-GAAP.  Can you just explain what that difference is.", "Lori A. Walker ", "Sure.  We\u2019re in a reported loss situation therefore GAAP requires that the basic and diluted shares are the same and that\u2019s what you see the shares the same.  But once you exclude the goodwill impairment loss then the appropriate diluted shares you should be using is 95.2 million.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Analyst for John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse.", "Analyst for John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "A few quick questions, overall volumes last quarter were down about 1%.  Were volumes down around the same this quarter or a little bit worse?  And also, what do you see by way of volumes in 2012?", "Lori A. Walker ", "The volumes were down a little bit more in the fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter.  We had talked about it being more in the mid-single digits versus the 1%.  And as we look into 2012 from a market growth perspective we\u2019re expecting the US and Europe to be flat to slightly positive growth with more mid-single digit growth in the regions of Asia and Latin America.", "John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Another quick one on volumes, were volumes roughly consistent throughout the quarter or did you see any type of slowdown as you went through the quarter towards the end?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "They were roughly consistent through the quarter.", "John McNulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Last quick one if I may, on raw materials could you talk a little bit about qualifications for Chinese TiO2 in terms of what progress you\u2019ve made and the viability of this alternative?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "We\u2019ve made a lot of progress.  Our technical people have done a great job in substituting Chinese TiO2 for what was formerly the chloride based TiO2 source from the multinationals.  We\u2019re doing the same thing in Europe and China.  It\u2019s been a notable success for us.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Gary you mentioned that some of your North American customers made inventory adjustments.  Could you comment more on that?  And just to review some of your comments about the market, you talk about how DIY was down for the year and obviously it\u2019s been tough with first half comps in calendar 2011 because of the first time homebuyer credit last year.  Are you saying even in calendar Q3 that the overall market was still down?  I thought DIY, at least the big boxes had been taking some share from the contractors so again, maybe you can comment on some of those dynamics in the US architecture market?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I\u2019ll just say Don that all the data that we have about the US DIY market says it was down this year and it was down certainly in the painting season is the third and fourth quarter for us and it was down on a year-over-year basis in the third and fourth quarter.  The inventory adjustment that we saw in our paint segment in North America I think was a normal reaction to a weak market.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "So you think your customers are going into year end with less inventory than they were a year ago relative to end market demand levels?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "This is non-material for them but for us, as the paint supplier, it was a reasonably large number.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "So based on that you think you\u2019re numbers could snap back next year and grow above the market rate if your customers go to a more normal inventory pattern?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I mean, the normal inventory pattern is that when the market is strong our customers tend to carry more inventory Don.  And this is obvious, but when the market is weak they tend to carry less and so the answer to your question depends on what kind of a market we have next year.  If we have an early spring and people are painting then I think that inventory will snap back.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Final question on pricing, what kind of mix benefit are you seeing from some of your new product initiatives thinking specifically of high def in the US and obviously that carries a much higher price point than the product it replaces so is mix a material contributor to your pricing gains?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "You mean to our earnings improvement?", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial", "Yes.", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I would say operating leverage has a higher impact than that.  All of the restructuring activities that we\u2019ve undergone really since 2008 have positioned us well with a cost structure that is highly leverageable so the new products, the new business that we\u2019re bringing in, in our industrial, particularly in our industrial segment is coming in at a very satisfactory level of profitability.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Chris [Mozilla] \u2013 Barclays Capital Markets. ", "Chris [Mozilla] \u2013 Barclays Capital Markets", "Just looking to next year if you could break your businesses down into sub segments industrial, packaging, coil, architectural, etc., where do you expect to see the most growth next year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Industrial.", "Chris [Mozilla] \u2013 Barclays Capital Markets", "And that would be more globally or how do you look at that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I think we\u2019re going to have a very good year in China.  I think we\u2019re going to have a very good year in Latin America, and I think we\u2019ll continue to grow in the US but at a lower rate than those two geographies Chris.", "Chris [Mozilla] \u2013 Barclays Capital Markets", "And you originally expected Wattyl to be accretive in 2011, do you know how much it was and what the expectations are for next year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I don\u2019t have that number.  It was accretive but I don\u2019t have the specific number.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "For FY \u201912 have you guys got an idea of how many basis points the restructuring in Wattyl might add to the paint segment?", "Lori A. Walker ", "The way I would answer that is even with the improvement in the Wattyl operating margins with the restructuring actions that we\u2019ve taken it will still be lower than the overall paint segment.  So it would still be depressing the paint segment margins.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "Maybe we model in 100 to 200 basis points of improvement in that segment in paints from Wattyl.", "Lori A. Walker ", "I don\u2019t have a specific number off the top of my head.  I mean, I think you can look at it in terms that we\u2019ve talked about the fact that when we bought that business it was about a $385 million business with 4% operating profit and we\u2019re looking at getting that business up to the corporate average in less than five years so it\u2019s going to be modest improvements for the next few years.  ", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "But your number is too high, it\u2019s not going to be that much.  That\u2019s a big segment.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "Just as a follow on, with respect to Europe you mentioned it was soft there.  I guess first question there is would your volumes have been positive in the quarter without the impact of Europe?  Then if you could just remind us what your strongest product lines are there?  I believe it\u2019s mostly  packaging but I just want to confirm that.", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "You\u2019re right, it\u2019s packaging and that\u2019s the majority of the business that we have.  But, we also have a general industrial and coil business, those two businesses were fairly week.  The packaging business in Europe this year was a little bit weak as well.  It wasn\u2019t a great pack season for the food pack and so unusually our packaging business, the volumes were actually down slightly in Europe last year which we think is probably not repeatable.  We think that with a decent spring and a good food pack those volumes will snap back.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "And so in the quarter if you exclude Europe \u2013 in other words the majority of your product lines in Europe are more resistant to the downturn that\u2019s occurring there right now?  Is that safe to say?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Yes.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "So without Europe your volume in the quarter would have still been negative?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "It probably would have been because we had a similar issue with packaging in North America in that it was a bad planting season for farmers, for the vegetable pack and our food business, which is a very significant part of our packaging business in North America also had the impact from the poor pack season.  So I think it still would have been negative.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research.", "Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research", "A quick question on what you\u2019re seeing in China both with respect to the existing Huarun paint business as well as how your new Valspar paint going into China kind of what are the goals for that premium product?  Do you hope that it will get as big as the Huarun internal paint sales or how should we think about the opportunity for your premium line in the region?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Well, we talk about it but I think we also said that our expectation for it were modest.  We\u2019re trying something new.  We\u2019re in the large cities not the smaller cities were the Huarun is.  We\u2019re selling it through one specific channel which is the developers channel for high end developments and we\u2019ve been pretty successful so far.  We\u2019ve got a backlog of new business.  We\u2019ve won a bunch of business.  But as to whether we\u2019re able to translate that into a large and sustainable business I think it\u2019s too early to tell.", "Huarun is a large and sustainable business and had another good year this year.  We didn\u2019t grow it frankly as fast as we did in the previous year but the market was a little bit softer in China this year than it had been in 2010, but we did grow it.  Our distributors are continuing to invest.  We grew our store count by about 500 stores in the year and I would say on balance it was a good year.", "Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research", "So the 500 stores what\u2019s that in terms of percentage and how many stores do you have currently?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "We\u2019ve been in the process of closing underperforming stores and adding stores that make more sense.  In terms of the overall base, this is a rough number, but let\u2019s say we grew the store base by 20%.", "Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research", "So the 500 stores was that net or without the closure?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "That was without the closures.  The net number would be smaller.", "Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research", "Secondly, just to follow up on a similar question with the product that you\u2019ve launched in the UK with a partner, can you talk about the successes or lack thereof you\u2019re having in that region and whether or not that\u2019s changing your thinking about perhaps getting into another European market with the right partner?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Well, the test and it\u2019s still a test, a limited number of stores, but the test has gone extremely well.  We\u2019ll be talking with our partner over the next several months about whether we expand the test to a larger number of stores.  I think  the second part of your question as to whether that changes our point of view depends on how successful we are with this first test.", "Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research", "So this will be more kind of an end of 2012 type of decision at the earliest?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "It\u2019s probably early calendar 2012 that we\u2019ll have a decision.", "Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research", "Final question, you\u2019re restructuring your wood coatings business, you\u2019ve taken a fairly large impairment charge from the Lilly acquisition that largely had to do with this business.  How should we think about wood coatings as part of Valspar going forward?  Is this a business where you\u2019re just in the pruning mode and basically you think the market is gone forever or is this a business that you\u2019re trying to streamline hoping to benefit if and when the furniture market and other wood coating applications come back?  Can you give us a little strategic thinking on that business?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "First, there are two pieces to our wood coatings business.  We have our China business which is a combination of Huarun and our traditional furniture business.  The Huarun business has been a good business since the day we acquired it.  It is, as Lori mentioned, Lori had the number and we grew it into low teens again this year after growing it in the low to mid-teens in 2010.  That\u2019s a good business.  Part of our restructuring in China was to combine our historical business with the Huarun business.  It\u2019s now under one management team and we have the opportunity to supply the whole market.  Whatever type of coatings our customers would like to purchase we can do.  ", "In North America our outlook on the North America housing market is that it\u2019s not a market that will recover any time soon and so we\u2019ve scaled back our strategic plan numbers for that business.  We closed three of our five plants in North America.  We only have two now and we think we\u2019ve got the right size to have a sustainable business.  But the reason that we took the impairment is that is a smaller business and the fair value of that business given our current expectations is much lower than it was when we acquired Lilly.  But, as Lori said, it\u2019s a business that is sized right for the current market, one where we can satisfy our customers well and one that is profitable and returning positive cash flow.", "Dmitri Silversteyn\u2013 Longbow Research", "Just to finish on the strategic thinking, aside from the large acquisition of Wattyl that you\u2019ve done you\u2019ve also picked up a smaller business in Latin America, are there any parts of your portfolio that you may be looking to divest?  Small business, or regions, or product lines that no longer fit with your vision?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Possibly, but it wouldn\u2019t be anything that\u2019s material to the overall company results.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from [Mils Walen \u2013 CSLA].", "[Mils Walen \u2013 CSLA]", "A follow up question on China, property prices have come down significantly in Tier-1 cities and they\u2019re also coming down in Tier-2 certainly dampening the prospect for the property market and leading to uncertainty whether China is going to have a soft landing or hard landing.  What are you seeing in those businesses, particularly Huarun relative to the relative property price declines?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I think that\u2019s good for us.  The lower the price of property the more people can afford apartments and the more paint we can sell.  As I said earlier, our distributors are continuing to invest.  The people I think that can answer that question best are the people who are on the front lines trying to sell to those apartment developers and to consumers who are buying their first, sometimes second apartments and they\u2019re continuing to invest.  So the headline story is obviously as you described it but I think on the ground our distributors still have a great deal of confidence that the market will continue to grow and we have wonderful opportunities.", "[Mils Walen \u2013 CSLA]", "With respect to your guidance about some moderate growth in North America and Europe next year, how much of that is in general the actual economy growing versus maybe Valspar outperforming the market versus better price or mix?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Lori\u2019s comment related to our point of view on basically GDP, whether we\u2019re going to get growth in the overall economy.  We believe that in order for us to grow next year in Europe and in the US we\u2019re going to have to do it with new business and that\u2019s market share gains.  In Latin America and Asia our growth will be a combination of new business and market growth.  That\u2019s our plan.", "[Mils Walen \u2013 CSLA]", "Just in North America in terms of the architecture market in DIY, Lowes made some comments that it is planning on closing stores.  Is there any change to your strategy within your paint segment relative to that announcement?  Are you going to try and sell more through independents or how are you addressing that store growth decline?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I mean we sell a number of channels in North America including Lowes.  Our strategy won\u2019t change.  We want to occupy the premium price points with premium products in whatever channel that we sell in and we\u2019re just going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing.  As I said, third party data indicates that we\u2019re outperforming the market.  There\u2019s not a lot we can do about the market but there\u2019s a lot we can do to continue to establish our brand and the premium positioning.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Lori, I just wanted to follow up, I thought you said part of the depressed tax rate in the fourth quarter was the regional source of earnings.  Is there something that would make that mix different in \u201912?  Why wouldn\u2019t you see some greater benefit on the tax line next year?  I think you gave guidance in the low 30s?", "Lori A. Walker ", "30% to 31% is what I gave guidance for and I also mentioned in terms of some of the benefit in the tax rate when you\u2019re looking at the full year was due to onetime non-recurring and so if you look then forward, and we\u2019ve done a projection on our best estimate of what we think the geographic mix will be next year, it would calculate out in the 30% to 31% range.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I\u2019m wondering if we could get a little bit help on maybe Gary, what you\u2019re seeing in terms of regional trends in the packaging markets?  I seem to read different things about can demand in the US, Europe and then the rest of the world.  What are you guys seeing or what are you expecting going into next year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I mentioned to a previous question, North America and Europe this year were a little bit weak.  I think our customers have indicated that in their calls as well largely due to a poor planting season and vegetable pack this year.  I wouldn\u2019t expect that that would be the case again next year.  I mean it might be but I would expect that that market would recover.  Asia is booming, I think there are 30 plus can lines that are going into Asia Pacific today.  We expect that we\u2019ll get our fair share of that business and we\u2019ll have nice growth in Asia next year and for many years to come, maybe for decades to come.  And in Latin America it\u2019s the same thing particular in Brazil, that\u2019s a very strong market and we expect to grow there again next year.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Is there a technology at play there that you\u2019ve got in some of your other businesses?  Is there  water component or getting out certain materials that people don\u2019t want in the packaging coatings or has that been long played out?", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "I think I\u2019d just answer that by saying that we\u2019ve been the technology leader in packaging coatings in a number of segments for a long time and we\u2019re continuing to make the investments in our R&D and our technical endeavors to make sure we keep that leadership position.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions at this time.", "Gary E. Hendrickson ", "Thanks everyone for your questions.  To summarize, we had a great year and expect to deliver double digit earnings growth in fiscal 2012.  Our guidance is $2.87 to $3.07 per share.  The assumptions behind our guidance are modest sales growth driven by new business, a moderating raw material environment, and continued focus on operational discipline and productivity improvement.

The company finished 2011 on a very solid footing, and 2012 was off to a strong start. We're looking forward to sharing these results with you and taking your questions. But before we get to that, let me take a moment to comment on an important change in our reporting structure. ", "This morning, the company filed an 8-K announcing the change in our reportable operating segments. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2011, we increased our reportable operating segments from 3 to 4 due to the continued revenue growth, geographic expansion and end-market diversity of our Global Finishes Group. The Latin American Coatings Group, previously aggregated within the Global Finishes Group, will now be reported as a stand-alone segment. The remaining Global Finish Group businesses, mainly automotive finishes, our OEM product finishes, and protective and marine coatings will make up the Global Finishes Group reportable operating segment.

Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2010 increased 13.5% to $1.13 billion. For the year, net sales increased 9.1% to $4.78 billion.

So I'll turn the call back over to Chris who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2012. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, Bob. We began 2011 with a cautious sense of optimism, and on our year-end call last year, we predicted that we'd look back probably on 2010 as a transition year for our company, the domestic paint coatings industry. We described the outlook at that time for many of our end markets as stable to improving. And as you recall, we tempered this outlook by saying that raw material cost inflation was likely to remain a challenge. ", "I think it's fair to say looking back, the conditions we faced over the past year in both of these fronts were more challenging than we anticipated. U.S. market demand for paint and coatings continued to trend downward, following the exploration of the 2010 home buyer tax credit stimulus. Department of Commerce buying estimates for the architectural market in the first half of 2011 were down 8% from 2010. Most Latin American markets fared better than the U.S, but European markets likely fared worse. I don't think I need to belabor the point too much on raw materials. ", "Our outlook at the beginning of 2011 was for industry-wide market basket of inflation in the high single to low double-digit range for the year, and the actual inflation rate, as we all know, was probably double that. Yet, against the challenging backdrop of depressed market demand and unprecedented raw material cost inflation, Sherwin finished 2011 with record sales and record earnings per share. ", "We continue to invest in new stores and branches, and we made great progress towards integrating the 4 acquisitions completed over the past 2 years. We generated strong net operating cash that was reinvested in the business, used to buy back our stock and pay a record dividend. ", "By most measures, 2011 was a successful year. But I'd like to comment briefly on the progress we made in a few specific areas because I think they best underscore the strength and focus of our organization. First, our ongoing commitment to expanding our store base and maintaining appropriate service levels on our stores despite the difficult market conditions is clearly paying off. Paint Stores Group achieved positive gallon volume growth for the full year 2011, and the rate of growth accelerated significantly in the second half and even more so in the fourth quarter. This growth was broad based with nearly every customer segment showing positive volume. More importantly, in a flat to down market, we are confident that our volume growth during the year translates to market share growth. ", "In 2011, our Paint Stores Group added 60 net new stores, bringing our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,450 locations compared to 3,390 a year ago. Our plan for 2012, again, calls for net new store openings in the range of 50 to 60 locations.", " ", "Looking beyond the Paint Stores Group, our company achieved a noteworthy milestone in the fourth quarter, as we surpassed 4,000 total company operated stores and branches across all operating segments worldwide. The same competitive advantages control distribution brings to our Paint Stores Group namely direct customer interaction, responsiveness and the control over brands, pricing, inventory and growth are equally applicable to our Global Finishes and Latin American Coatings Group. For these regions, control distribution will continue to play an important and expanding role in these segments going forward. ", "Second, I'd like to take a moment to comment on our continued progress in working capital management and cash performance. At year end, our working capital ratio had dropped to 10.9% of sales compared to 11.9% at the end of 2010, convincing evidence that the integration of the acquisitions completed in the past 2 years is on track. ", "This tight working capital management contributed to higher cash generation. For the year, we generated $736 million net operating cash or about 8.4% of sales. If we add back the cash settlement paid to the IRS during the year, cash from operations for the year rose above 9% of net sales. ", "Free cash flow, operating cash minus CapEx and dividends, finished the year at $428 million. In the fourth quarter, we acquired just under 0.5 million shares of the company stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 4.7 million shares purchased at an average cost of $78.16 per share, our total investment of $367 million. ", "At year end, we have remaining authorization to acquire another 21 million shares of the company stock. Over the past year, we've returned more than $153 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2011 marked our 33rd consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue in 2012.", "The third and final area I'd like to touch on is our earnings per share performance for the year. $4.84 before the IRS settlement is a record for our company and a solid performance considering the stiff headwinds we faced in the market. If you believe the old expression that what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, emerging from 2011 a much stronger company than we were a year ago. And while we still have work to do in offsetting the raw material inflation we incurred this past year through a combination of productivity and price implementation, I believe that 15% earnings per share growth in this environment proves the resilience of the business model.", "Looking ahead to this year, there appears to be a growing sentiment in the market predicting better times ahead. Many see early signs of the housing recession that's finally nearing an end, while others forecast moderating rates of raw material inflation. From a demand side, we too see early but encouraging signs of improvement in the residential markets. Time will tell whether this momentum is durable and whether it will ultimately lead the U.S. housing market back to more sustainable levels in the coming years. ", "On the raw material front, however, we still expect significant cost headwinds in 2012, primarily from titanium dioxide. Couple this with the annualization of inflation from 2011, and we would expect the average year-over-year raw material cost increases for the paint and coatings industry to be in the high single to low double-digit percentage range in 2012. ", "With these factors in mind, our outlook for the first quarter of 2012 is for consolidated net sales to increase 9% to 14% compared to last year's first quarter. With sales of that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.74 per share compared to $0.63 per share earned in the first quarter of 2011. ", "For the full year, we expect net sales will increase by a high single digits to low-teens percentage versus 2011. And with annual sales of that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2012 will be in the range of $5.37 to $5.67 per share.", "Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question's coming from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Chris, just wanted to know what your assumption was for the U.S. architectural market behind your guidance range for next year and of course, the DOC getting away with it with their reporting. But you're talking about an 8% decline in the first half of '11, what's your assessment for full year and again, what's sort of your base case for calendar 2012?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Don, I think in terms of our expectations for the year going forward for the industry, if we build it up from the pieces parts. We would expect that the housing market is going to continue to show a moderate gain. We think all in on both single-family and multifamily this year, we're going to end somewhere in the mid-to-upper 600,000 units. We think that's going to potentially grow to the low to mid-700,000 units. That will be a little bit of a lift, and we think that the repaint market has also been improving moderately. So all in, I think our kind of expectation for the industry will be that we'll see flat to low single-digit volume gains for the architectural market.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And then a question on your new segment reporting, the old Global Finishes Group with so many acquisitions you were thinking of margin improvement from sort of the 6% range to maybe 11%, 12% by 2014. How does that change as you strip Latin America out, and what do you see is the margin potential for Latin America, which I guess is running around 9% now?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, why don't I ask Sean Hennessy, our CFO, to jump in with that, Don.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, Don, again we used to talk about the 12% when we talked about the Global Group. We still believe that both pieces will still be shooting at that 12%. I think that you can see Latin America Group is over 9%, which means that they're a little closer. We expect them to reach that 12% prior to the Global Group. But as we continue to do more things in Latin America with controlled distribution and so forth, after we hit 12%, we'll probably reevaluate that.", "Operator", "Our next question's coming from Chris Nocella of Barclays Capital.", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Your same stores growth is 12.7% in the quarter, what's the split there between price and volume?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, pricing for the stores group, Chris, was in the upper single-digit range. So that's the majority of it, however, we would note that the volume performance in the quarter really was strengthening for that business.", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And based on the already announced price increases, do you think you'll still have the greatest benefit in the fourth quarter, or could be -- first quarter be actually a little bit higher?", "Christopher M. Connor", "In terms of pricing or...", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. Yes, for the pricing, do you think the flow-through will be higher in the first quarter than it was in the fourth?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "For the store group?", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Correct.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, yes. In the fourth quarter, which has the second smallest EPS when you look at the absolute dollars, the adjustments that go through there, we had the impairment of some trade names and so forth that -- but, if you took a look at some of the inventory adjustments that go through in the fourth quarter, the flow-through is acceptable. But when you take a look at the fourth quarter, we should -- first quarter, we should not have that, those headwinds.", "Christopher J. Nocella - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just lastly, on the Latin America business, organic sales growth was about 11% 2011. What is your expectation for that business in 2012?", "Christopher M. Connor", "In the business, we'll continue to tuck along pretty well. We're going to have some FX issues in Latin America next year with the REI [ph], so I don't know if we've given guidance yet per se in the pieces parts, but it'll be a positive year for Latin American Coatings next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "In your Paint Stores Group, you had double-digit sales and flat operating profits, whereas in the Consumer Group you had flat sales and if you adjust for some non-recurring items last year, you had 50% improvement in operating profits. So why is it that in the business where you had all the sales growth, you didn't really have any operating profit growth, whereas the opposite took place in consumer?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, Jeff, this is Sean Hennessy. When you take a look -- if I can remind you the third quarter, and when you looked at the third quarter the Consumer Group was 11.7% versus 17.5% in 2010 third quarter. And at that time, what we've said is if you looked at our -- the way our inventory was coming down, usually we started to reduce our inventory in the third quarter. And when someone asked why was our margin in Consumers down as dramatic, we said that the reverse will happen in the fourth quarter. That was you take some of that inventory off your balance sheet that's debit going through the P&L because we're producing less. That occurred in the third quarter this year versus the fourth quarter in 2010. So as you can see 11.7%, we're at 12% in the fourth quarter, and the 17.5% was 10.2% in 2010. So that's how -- a lot of different things are happening in the quarter-by-quarter that sometimes the quarters are changing as you manage your inventory and the balance sheet and so forth. So that's why the 2 quarters in the third and the fourth quarter of Consumer were that way. And again, as I mentioned in the Paint Stores Group, with $133 million last year, second smallest quarter, and with the fourth quarter with inventory adjustments, LIFO and others and the trade names, that really would caused the reduction in the flow-through but without it, they showed acceptable flow-through.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just while we're on the subject, what was your gallon inch growth in 2011?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We said the gallons were positive for the company in 2011. And we said that, that had been trending throughout the year and are more favorable with the fourth quarter being our best gallon quarter.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, there are some -- or possibly there are some properties that are on the market with exposure to the auto repaint and auto OEM markets, is that something that if they were available at attractive prices would be of interest to Sherwin-Williams even though they may be of relatively large size?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Jeff, we've never commented on a specific M&A opportunity that's out there. I'm familiar with the property you're talking about. I think strategically you've heard us speak to the investment community about our interest in the automotive aftermarket segment but not the automotive OE segment. We'll just leave it at that.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Chris, you mentioned that you gained share in your Paint Stores business, so are you taking share from other independent store chains? And is that more than offsetting any share loss that you may have had to the DIY segment?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, P.J., I think that our comment here is broad based for the industry as opposed to any specific channel segment. Although I think you're right to talk about the smaller, independent paint store operator that struggled in this downturn. I think it's easy to see share gains from there, as well as some of the other regional paint store chain operators that we think we've made progress against. There's not been an offset for our DIY business. We've commented throughout the year last year that our DIY performance was strong. In fact, on all the consolidated numbers that we've given you both on sales revenue and gallon performance for DIY, our numbers were there or slightly higher. So a strong DIY year for the company through our store's organization offset a little bit by the loss of DIY business through our Walmart account. But overall, a pretty strong performance as we've commented. Looking at all the industry data we can get our hands, in order the gallon performance were pretty confident across all segments, there were share gains here.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then secondly, can you update us on your efforts to reduce your TiO2 usage in paint? And do you have any volume market expectations?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We have a number of initiatives underway to address the titanium issue. And we've talked about them in the past with the investment community relative to replacing titanium with either lower-grade sulfite type titaniums, internal formulations to reduce the use of it in sourcing perhaps some emerging technologies from other parts around the world. All of those activities are underway. I think we've given guidance that were those to all come to fruition, we'd be somewhere in the 5% to 10% range of our total titanium tonnage usage that could be replaced. And I'd say we're in the early days of making progress towards that.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And just quickly for Sean. Sean, you mentioned you think some FX headwinds from Latin America. And given that industrial production, IP has been slowing down in Brazil lately. Are you seeing any impact on volumes there?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Slightly, but not dramatic enough to not give us confidence that we're going to have improvement in Brazil, as well as Latin America.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "First question I have is, you've always been sort of conservative on your housing outlook, is there a sign in the market now or something in the market that is more directly related to the repaint business or your store business that maybe is more positive now than it was, than it had been in the past? Or is it just the general market that you're looking at that gives you some optimism going to 2012?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, I think the housing is more positive than it's been on the last 2 to 3 to 4 years. We hit bottom somewhere in the 400,000 to 500,000 units, and we're seeing 600,000 and change starts this year. Most of the economic forecasters that we look at, and we think this makes sense, show a number slightly better than that next year. We see that from permits that have been pulled and projects that are being bid on by our painting contracting customers. So that outlook looks a little bit brighter to us. And we've also just been watching the trend guidance. The residential and the commercial repaint markets, as a reminder, still account for approximately 80% of all the gallon inch that our industry sells. And that tends to kind of start to move and stay on the trend line. And it's been a really -- a good trend line the last couple quarters. And as we said briefly in our comments, the year's off to a good start, really driven by this maintenance painting project. So heading into the year with a fairly optimistic outlook about what we're going to see through that architectural volume through our stores this year.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then, Sean, in the Consumer Group, are you -- are operations and the inventory build, is that going to sort of move back to historical operating patterns? Or is it going to be similar to the first half of this year where it was -- a buildup inventory and then as you talked in the second half were sort of a -- you worked out the inventory?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. I think we're going to go more to the historical. And I think that's why when you look at the improvement that consumer had in the first quarter as they built inventory last year, we'll still build inventory. But I like your description, more of historical. And I think the bell shape curve will be closer to historical. So we probably will not see the changes by quarter that we did this year.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then lastly, what was that FX gain related to? And then, what do you expect your 2012 tax rate to be?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think our tax rate is going to be in the lower 30s like we have been for the past. If you take the change out in the tax rate with leveraging [ph] settlement, we're in the low 30s also. But the FX gain and really the gain in the quarter was really driven in Brazil and Mexico, but the FX plus year-to-date was really Mexico. And then the Venezuela, what happened at the beginning of the year with Venezuela.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Greg Melich of ISI Group.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to dig a little bit more into SG&A. Now that we cycled a lot of the acquisitions, is that -- that 4% year-over-year growth, I guess it's $25 million, $30 million year-over-year, should we think of that as a normalized run rate now that we've cycled the acquisitions and other things?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think that when you take a look at it, 4%, 4.5%, the 4.5% increase in the fourth quarter is more normalized. If you think that we've annualized the major acquisitions in Europe through the first 3 quarters, that's why the full year is probably a little different but I think you're right on with that analysis.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Chris, maybe a bigger picture question. In the past, you've seen over many years your -- the range of the gross margin that the business could do used to be sort of 42% to 45% and then sort of shifted up to 43% to 46%, but you've also been making acquisitions, you've been growing overseas. Do you think that 43% to 46% is still the right range? Or just given the acquisitions, given the business mix that maybe it goes back to 42%, 45% for a few years?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, we still feel good about that range, Greg. And I think, of note, we've announced yet another price increase for calendar year 2012. As you know, we give full transparency to The Street regarding the pricing activities taken by our stores group. And we announced an 8% price increase effective February 1 of 2012. So we're going to continue to move pricing into the market place. A great deal of it will depend on what happens with titanium for the rest of the year but if it holds in kind of the range that we have given for the year, for the industry for our basket going up, and we fully expect to be back to in the 43% to 46% range.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "First question is regarding impairment charges, Sean. I'm looking at the P&L and you got trademark impairment charges, which you talk about in the text of the press release, but you're also mentioning asset impairment charges. Are we talking about 2 separate line items or 2 separate types of impairment charges?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, I think we're talking about the same thing. It's really related to trade names. As you know, when we acquired [indiscernible] and the store group, you're looking at MAB, Duron, some others, [indiscernible], some of these trade names we keep for quite a while. But when you -- as you continue to stop using those brand names, you're doing the mark to market on your balance sheet, so you're doing it. Last year those impairments actually went to global and dealt with a long time acquisition from prior years.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Well, the reason I'm asking or focused on this, Sean, is the P&L. The amount for 2011 is bigger than $4.5 million of 2010, yet in the text, it's talking about a $0.03 hit this year versus $0.04 last year. I was wondering if you could reconcile that.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "That is -- I'll get back to you on that, Chuck, the question on the $0.03 versus the $0.04.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Yes, that's what had me confused there. All right. Got you. Now when we're looking at the new segment reporting, Sean, it's been astounding, at least to me, spread between the operating margin of the Latin America Group versus Global Finishes, and I'm wondering what accounts for that. Is it some allocation things or just the nature of the products? But regarding the latter, you'd think some of these protective coatings would have higher margins than architectural?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Chuck, I think it really has to do with the scale of the businesses. We've been in Brazil for many, many years, a lot longer than we have been in China. And some of these acquisitions that we did complete in 2010, as you know, when you take a look at the purchase price versus sales, it was lower than the dollar per dollar that we always -- that we refer to every once in a while. We've continually said those were at lower operating margins. So I think that it's a good change. You're going to see that, but I think that, that's really the reason why.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. Could you be a little -- give us any precision on what the volume growth in the fourth quarter was in paint stores?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think as we -- the earlier question when we talked about the revenue in the 12% range and that the pricing portion of that was in the upper single digit, not the high single-digit, the rest of that is going to be volume. So by mathematics, Chuck, that's going to get you in the mid-single digit range.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay, so similar to the third quarter?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Stronger than the third quarter.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "A little stronger?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Stronger than the third quarter.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. Now when you look at what your paint stores customers are doing, both the contractors and the DIY, when they're in the store, are you seeing anything that indicates less sensitivity to price increases or a willingness to build the market basket? For example, a contractor finally getting past the hump on buying an incremental piece of equipment or whatever it may be.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think as the volume comes, and we were commenting in the last couple of quarters that has been coming. And don't forget, that volume is building on the backs of essentially fixed price increases announced in the last 20 months. So there's a concern that pricing is having a chilling effect on demand? Once again proving that to be the case is more of the broader market issues that are causing painters to get going again. We'll see the lifts in the associated product sales and really the equipment sales are more of a end of first quarter start of second quarter. And we'll be able to comment a little bit more on that side of it going forward. But in terms of product mix and continuing to move up to better quality products, all those levers which are historically at play here, Chuck, are still behaving as they have historically.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Chuck, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to jump in here and answer that question on the $0.03 versus $0.04. The dollars that you quoted which is right from us is what hits the SG&A. Last year, in the $0.04 there was also a $2.1 million impairment that went to cost of goods sold. So that's why it was $0.04 last year and $0.03 this year.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "So $0.04 -- go that by me again, there's a...", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Included in last year's $0.04, besides the amount that we -- that you quoted is also a $2.1 million that went to cost of goods sold. And so that's what's in the $0.04. We didn't include it in the absolute numbers that you quoted earlier.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "So the $2.1 million is not in that EPS amount, but it is in the $5.49 million.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, no. We're talking about last year's when the number is higher. It also -- the $0.04 included a $2.1 million impairment hit into cost of goods sold. The other number you quoted is the SG&A piece.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. First, just a question on the raw material guidance. If I heard you right, I think you said high single to low double-digit raw material cost for 2012. I think on the third quarter call, you might have mentioned that if prices stayed where they were then, you'd be looking at more like low- to mid-teens. And I think we've since gotten a price increase in TiO2. So we're just wondering if something has changed since then, or maybe you're seeing something in the organic side of the bucket or the metal side of the bucket that you're expecting a decline there next year just due to the components of that raw increase.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Great question, Brian. And that's very intuitive to pick that up, because you're right, there has been a little bit of a change. And I want to ask Bob just to comment on what we're seeing here.", "Robert J. Wells", "Sure, Brian. The question that we answered on last quarter's call was if you took -- if you straight-lined raw material cost where we finished the quarter, in third quarter, what would it bode for 2012 as it annualizes. It's a little different question asking the same question at the end of fourth quarter because a good portion of the raw material basket eased somewhat during the fourth quarter. So we're starting from a slightly lower base in the fourth quarter. Annualized 2011 cost going through '12 today would amount to mid-to high single-digits for the industry. And then on top of that, we anticipate continued inflation in TiO2 as we indicated.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So was it mostly the resins that gave you some of the release in the fourth quarter?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then on the SG&A, I think it sounded like you're expecting continued kind of 4% to 4.5% growth year-over-year. And contrasting that against your high single to low teens sales growth guidance, that implies a lot of leverage in 2012. Do you think that will be enough to offset any gross margin compression that you might have from a raw material price increases?", "Robert J. Wells", "All right. I think that when you take a look at it, we really -- we try to give you sales and EPS guidance. I mean, we don't go down each component whether it's gross margin and give guidance especially at this time. But I think when you look at the high point to midpoint and the low point, I think that it bodes that we're going to have operating margin improvement next year.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then I think I heard you mentioned that the Eastern regions led the way on the same-store sales growth in the paint stores. Was that a change from what you've been seeing recently? Or is there anything kind of in the composition of where the same store sales growth is coming geographically that gives you some increased confidence that this housing recovery is meaningful and we're going to -- you'll actually have a recovery in 2012?", "Robert J. Wells", "This is Bob, Brian. I think the eastern division has kind of been lagging on the new construction side simply because there's not as much you new developments and space to develop in eastern geographic regions. I think the strong performance by Eastern division in the fourth quarter really suggests that the repaint market in the Eastern division were outperforming those in the other divisions. Although as Chris pointed out, all 4 -- or as I pointed out, all 4 divisions had double-digit sales growth in the fourth quarter. So we're kind of splitting hairs trying to determine difference between the 4.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's pretty broad based then?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chris, you mentioned in response to a previous question that you thought you might be able to reduce your titanium dioxide requirement by 5% to 10%, as one of your major global coatings peers has made similar remarks within the last 6 or 8 weeks. Just want to drill down a little bit on that. You mentioned it was early days, can you give us a feel for where you are today relative to that target range? Also, the timing that you would envision to achieve the range and how much you can get from new technologies versus, let's say, just diminishing the content on lower-end products, if that's an option.", "Christopher M. Connor", "We're not in the range today. We'd be below that. The expectation would be that over the next years, we would work to get in there. And I think that's about the breadth of what we'd be comfortable commenting on. We recognize that given the choice of a poor performing product or a consistent product at a higher price, the vast majority of our customers would opt for the latter. And so any decisions we make to replace titanium, reduce titanium, formulate titanium out go through a very rigorous field testing process. So we're going to lag a little bit perhaps our peers ability to move in this range. Nevertheless, it's work worth doing, and there's opportunities there and I feel that we're on target of where we should be.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then shifting gears, Sean, Brazilian currency and a lot of other currencies for that matter have been quite volatile since Labor Day of last year, can you remind us how you're approaching hedging, especially now that we have the separate Latin segment there. How should we think about your activities or lack thereof?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think that we continually look at, again, cash flow. We're doing -- we're borrowing in country. We borrowed in country when we've been to Europe, as well as some of the other acquisitions that we made. And this operating income is being created -- or cash is being created, we continue to pay down. While these companies are bringing cash back to us here in the United States, we're doing some forward contracts and so forth. But we're also doing things between one country and the other, so that we have inter-companies that are protecting us.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones. Chris, I think you mentioned in the fourth quarter, you said the volume growth that you saw was across every customer segment. I was just curious if there's a meaningful spread between top and bottom. So any color I guess you could give on which segments are at the extremes. And then if there's any meaningful discrepancy, maybe give us the order of magnitude.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think the trend line there, Dennis, have been that the DIY business and the residential repaint business through our contractor segments were at the high end. That's been consistent with kind of the year's performance. The news in the quarter is that the new residential, and some of the commercial markets which had been lagging turned positive for us as well, and that's a really good sign.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "Okay. And then just big picture I guess, in hindsight when you look at the paint store performance for the year being up in dollars and margin pressure being pretty minimal despite the volume challenges that you talked about and the raw material [indiscernible]. Can you give any more confidence about what the recovery could look like or where margins could return to if you do get the volume growth and the return to normal?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think when you take a look at one tank [ph], the high points for the Paint Stores Group was 15%, 15.7% operating margin. I don't see anything structurally different. We see that as a possibility in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "A lot of my questions have been answered, but just to follow-up, you did discuss the -- or at least directionally the volume performance of the stores group. Assuming kind of similar levels of pricing for the Consumer Group, it looks like your volumes were down significantly and significantly more than would be suggested by the loss of the Walmart business. So anything happened in the Consumer Group in the fourth quarter to give you that result?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well first of all, our selling price -- effective selling price is a little longer. The cycle is a little longer in Consumer Group than it is in stores. So they were not as -- it wasn't as high as it was in the stores. I don't have that number exactly but having said that, I think we were pretty happy the way the fourth quarter came out with Consumer Group.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So 4% to 5% volume loss I guess was at the high end of your expectations, is that what you're saying?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I mean, I think without the Walmarts -- I think in the Walmart, this was the last dramatic quarter we had to go through. And I think that without that, I think it was right where we -- where was our expectations.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "All right, very good. Secondly on talking about margins and kind of the way to think about that for 2012 and beyond. Clearly, if raw material inflation stays as benign, and I don't know if that's the right word to use, but say ass benign as you think it will, which is high single digits, low double-digit type of inflation, given high single-digit pricing that you pass through and the traction that you already got with your existing pricing, it sounds like you should stay on par, or maybe you can get ahead of raw materials a little bit. So the gross margin side of the business looks like you're okay. But what concerns me about your comment about margin improvement and year-over-year after 3 years of decline is that your fastest growth is happening in your Global Group and your Latin American Group, both of which are lower-margin businesses. So is the improvement you're seeking in your North American business is going to be sufficient to offset the negative mix, if you will, from the lower margin businesses growing faster in the external markets, international markets?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well first of all, Dmitry, isn't it wonderful to be talking about benign raw material cost increases in the high single, low doubles. I mean, where have we gotten to in this industry? I think you make a very good point about the faster growing segments over the past couple of years. But I think what you should be reading into this guidance that we're giving today is that our stores business is clearly back on track and moving in a really solid direction here with the pricing leverage that we need. We're giving guidance that we expect the gross margins to bottom and turn, in fact to go the right direction. As Sean commented, we expect with that, that the SG&A numbers will continue to go the right direction as well and that the operating leverage for the entire company, this year will be positive.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, very good. And then finally, you talked about the Global Group having the ability to reach 12% operating margin at sometime in the future. It's almost a 10-point improvement that you're looking to gain there. What's going to take you there and, how long is that going to take?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We have a couple of acquisitions that were significant in this business that were 1.5 to 2 years into the integration of it. We talked last year, I think, on a number of the calls about the need for pricing in those businesses, that we had not been as aggressive as we should have been, given the careful stance we were taking as new owners of this business. I think all of the kind of traditional work that we do here on pricing, on the operating side of the business, on the cost side of the business, on the asset side of the business helps build these businesses in the right direction, and all those things are as quick here. To Sean's point, we have been consistent about giving guidance that these businesses will constructurally get there. There's nothing that's changed our opinion about that. And if scale comes up on these countries, we fully expect to get that accomplished.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Let me see if I can have this a different way. How much of the profit improvement you're looking to get out of the Global Group is going to be improving the profitability of the 2 wood coatings businesses you bought in Europe versus just a maturation of already nice unit margin businesses you have in automotive aftermarket, marine and productive and some other mid shift business that are part of the global group?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think we would expect to be getting slightly higher percentage operating lift from those businesses than they would play for their volume. I mean, they're early in their cycle, and they should be ramping up quicker. We gave you some guidance in terms of the size of those business when we acquired them, relative the entire new size of the global group now that you have that data point. But I think what's important to note is that all of the businesses, both the domestic parts of those businesses, as well as the other corners of the world, we all expect those things to improve this year.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And I think that in the short term, Chris is absolutely right. But to answer your question a little differently, just because of the size differential between the acquisition versus the core, the absolute dollars will grow faster from the core just because that's 70% of the sales approximately. And so the acquisitions that are 30%, 35%, a little higher than 30% -- our percentage will grow faster, but the absolute dollars will grow faster in the core.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "The volume numbers on the stores in the fourth quarter was also something we haven't seen in quite some time. I'm curious, Chris, on the confidence that you have. And I know that visibility is never great in this business, but things you're looking at to give you some confidence on the sustainability or where that goes and what you're assuming what your guidance implies for that in 2012?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Nick, on that opening comment there -- you made a point that the 2012 was off to a solid start. So we're seeing the kind of gallon numbers that we experienced ramping up in the fourth quarter, continue on that same trend line into the first quarter of this year. Of note, we've just returned from Nashville, Tennessee where we had 7,000 of our employees gathered in one room, all of our store managers and field sales folks, and it's always a terrific time to be with our team. And the sense from their face-to-face contact with their customers would indicate that we're expecting that this industry is going to have a better gallon growth this year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And the better is you commented when you went through the details that it's commercial and new resi, is that sort of where the inflection is taking place?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think it's across the whole volume. I think that was the question about kind of the range from Dennis, at Delman [ph] about what's the high, what's the low. And we commented that both the res repaint and the DIY gallons continue to move up, and the new commercial and new residential have gone positive. So really across all these kind of breakout segments. There was movement up by hundreds of basis points in the demand for gallon. Not one went more aggressively than other, but we got the negatives positive which was a really a good sign.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Nils Wallin of CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "This year seems to be -- or at least this winter, it's where we're probably running about 7% warmer than last year, have you noticed any seasonality in the order patterns that you're seeing, that you saw assuming in the fourth quarter and you're seeing so far this year in the first quarter?", "Christopher M. Connor", "The first quarter is always a weather quarter. Fortunately, it's our smallest quarter of the year. So there may be a little bit of that happening. As we've had warmer weather in the upper Midwest and upper Northeast, we've been getting wiped out in Texas and other places. Per the earlier comment, I guess was with our 5 Alaska store managers, they've got 18 feet of snow in Alaska. So I think there's marginal impact on weather, but for the most part it's not that big of deal for us.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay. Now I think in your guidance regarding the raw material basket, you spoke mostly about TiO2 going up, but some of the organics or resins getting some relief there. Certainly there's an expectation in some parts of the market about propylene prices moving back up because of the ply [ph] constraints and what have you. Now I know obviously, as in propylene but it translates into downstream resins that you're buying. What are you seeing or what are your expectations in that regard? And are you -- do you expect your resins -- do you expect there could be some resin increases later on in the year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "The short answer is yes. I think the rate of increase is likely to moderate compared to last year, but our expectations for the raw material basket for the industry being up high single digits to low teens does incorporate some inflation on the non-pigment side of the raw material basket.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just more of I guess a broader look, your control distribution model in North America is certainly envy of the industry, but then it's probably a little bit different of how you would approach it in South America. Are you looking for the same type of expanse and density of your distribution model in South America? And what type of investment do you think you'll need to make to get there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, good question. Not every country and every market within the country fits the model, as well as perhaps it does in North America. So just to give you a little more clarity to that, for example, in Brazil within the southern part of the country, around S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio, traditional and very, very strong independent paint dealer network that we sell our products through and want to continue to support those folks. In the northeastern part of the country, not so much and that's really  where we focus our store growth from an architectural neighborhood paint store. Yes, we would need the same kind of density in that geography within the country of Brazil and the economics are very similar to the U.S. economics in terms of what it costs to open a store. We rent these facilities, we put about the same amount of inventory, fixing, et cetera, into them. So I don't think that we need to get to the 3,500 store count density model in the United States for Latin America to start showing the same kind of operating margins. But suffice it to say, there'll be pockets where we can run at that same density. I hope that's helpful, Nils.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from John Roberts of Buckingham Research Group.", "John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Did you leave all of the automotive refinish in the new global segment?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes.", "John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "So you're going to keep that, U.S., everything all in that one place?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, those businesses are, on the industrial coating side, global by nature. So there still will be U.S. businesses included in that global business.", "John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Right, and Latin America refinish as well.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Latin America?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Christopher M. Connor", "The automotive refinish is in that global group.", "John E. Roberts - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Okay. And then secondly, as a leading indicator, sometimes in the past you've talked about spray equipment, ladders, et cetera, have you seen anything in your distribution sales to some of that stuff to give you encouragement as well?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, the volume there is solid. Sales are up double digits in those segments and just as a reminder though, this is kind of the off-season for that when we get back to our first quarter call, we'll really be in the second, then we'll have a better feel for that. But even in an off-season, to be up solid double-digit sales gains on those types of things would be an indication of better confidence for our paint and contractors, John.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Jeti Pandya [ph] of Berenberg Bank.", "Unknown Analyst", "A couple of questions, really quick. You alluded to you are taking market share in a shrinking market. Now thankfully and hope, you are right. The market is sort of starting to turn. Now when it does turn, I mean, what sort of market share do you envisage? I mean, do you expect to grow faster than guys with sort of stores and similar distribution network? And I'm referring to basically TPG [ph] [indiscernible]Valspar, and that's the first question. And then the second question is with regards to TiO2 per se, I mean one of your very big suppliers is putting capacity in, in a more midterm situation, and they were saying that paint companies are trying to talk to them with regards to longer-term contracts. Have you developed or have you had any longer-term contract with regards to securing supply for TiO2 per se simply because they were also alluding to the fact that TiO2 market in the U.S. could become a bit tighter as the year progresses?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Sure, Jeti [ph]. I'll take the first question on the market share and ask Sean to comment a little bit about our titanium contract structure and how we think about that market. Our expectation on market share is exactly to your point against the other operators of regional paint for a change. And as a reminder, we've shared with The Street frequently the kind of customer mix shift between painting contractors and do-it-yourself. And as we start to see a little healthier economy, i.e. the housing starts increasing, some of the commercial projects increasing, we expect to see a rebound in the role of the painting contractors will play in the total purchases of these products, and that bodes well for us. We have a commanding lead on store count. We're widening that gap on an annual basis. All those things make sense that they should in fact deliver the higher market share for the company and typically that comes against those that are also providing products and services to painting contractors. So that's where we expect to get it. Having said that, the DIY still is a sizable portion of the business in the market. And again from earlier comments, you know that we've been talking about really solid double-digit sales teams in our DIY business for a while. So at least holding our own, if not gaining a little bit of share from a small base to the stores platform on DIY. So all in, we think another solid market share opportunity year for us is coming up. Sean, you want to comment on the titanium for Jeti [ph]?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. I would say that in the last few years, this decade's really been one of the most volatile decades in raw material, in all of raw materials. But I would say that the word contract is sometimes overused. I would say no, we don't have contracts per se but probably have more agreements. We will probably and we're always looking to make sure that we can take care of our customers. We'd like to have only one price increase a year. We've gone above that many, many times. So in the -- right now we're watching -- years ago, we wanted to have a contract -- we were -- but we'd never buy a 100%. You'd always want to be somewhat in the spot market. I think the way these raw materials have been rising in the last few years, they've been less optimistic about -- or less wanting to do a contract with us on a firm price. I think that what we're doing as we're watching the market and if we see an opportunity to buy a longer-term contract, we might do it. But I would say it's more in the state of flux right now.", "Unknown Analyst", "Maybe just a quick follow-up, x TiO2, your raw materials bill, is it fair to assume that it goes up maybe between 0% to 4%, 3%, 4%?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I don't know if I'd put it in a range, Jeti [ph]. I think that -- I think it's -- suffice it to say, we do expect inflation on that side of the basket and it's one of the reasons why we give a range for raw materials in general is because rather than pinning it down to a specific inflation percent, we know that, that side of basket will go up.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Jeremy Brunelli of Consumer Edge Research.", "Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Just a couple of quick questions. I wanted to validate some of your comments versus what was in the press release. I think you said in the Paint Stores Group that you saw improving volumes across most segments, but it sounds like what you're saying is you saw it across all segments. Should I interpret that, that there were some segments that were kind of a flat growth pace from third quarter to fourth quarter? Is there any read into that?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think you for the fourth quarter, it's all segments; for the year, some segments. And when we talked about the new residential piece of that really being the segment that improved, that was the good news in the fourth quarter.", "Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Got you, okay. And I think you said that you saw ramping volumes, does that mean like the pace of growth through the quarter was accelerating in 2012?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes.", "Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Okay. And then, do you have any sense in the, I guess, in the repaint market if there's been an inflection point between kind of strength and maintenance versus infection more towards bigger [indiscernible] capital improvement?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We don't have a good feel for that one. We don't give that perspective on a repaint job if it's because of a major remodeling job or commercial capital expenditure to your point. We get great visibility between new constructions and maintenance, but that is a fine line in fact that we don't really get that visibility, Jeremy.", "Jeremy  Ridder  Brunelli - Consumer Edge Research, LLC", "Great. And then one last question, can you just remind us what the lead time is from when, either from a permit or from a housing start to where the pro painters start to buy paint from you guys?", "Christopher M. Connor", "On average in the residential market that would be about 6 to 8 months lag.", "Operator", "Our last question is coming from Jeffrey Zekauskas of JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Do you worry that there's adequate TiO2 supply over a multiyear period if the coatings industry globally grows, I don't know, 3.5%?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, Jeff, that's certainly a topical question for discussion, and you have to go beyond the titanium producers to the ore producers to get your arms wrapped around that. And I think there's been a lot more focus from the paint manufacturing side to do just that. I certainly paid a lot more attention into the various minds and capacity around the world than we would have in past decades as we've been dealing with the titanium for some time. And I think that it kind of depends on who you're talking to and who's trying to push pricing, whose going to indicate what the availability is. We are convinced that the core earth ore required to make titanium is an extremely plentiful ore in the world. We're not worried about a shortage of that at any time in the future. However, the ability to mine it and get it out and have it ready to be converted is of some concern. Just as we commented and the industry has commented on some of the capacity expansions that the producers are generating, we see the same thing coming from the mining side as well. Time will tell over how all that kind of comes together, and if we end up with more shortages than not. We've also talked regarding our ability to maybe offset some of this demand, as well as some of our competitors are perhaps as aggressive, if not more so than we are in that space. So I think it's really early to comment on that. We are quite confident that as we look out to 2012 and short term beyond that, but that the availability of supply will be sufficient to fund the company's growth.", "Operator", "I'd like to hand the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thank you, Jackie. Let me conclude this morning's call by asking you to save the date of Wednesday, May 23, 2012, on your calendars. That's the date we'll host our annual financial community presentation this year at the Park Plaza Hotel in Boston. The program will consist of our customary morning presentations with Q&A, followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Wednesday, May 23.

Juvekar - Citi", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Andrew Don - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Mike Hamilton - RBC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the first quarter earnings conference call. (Operator Instructions) And I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Lori Walker, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Lori Walker", "Good morning and welcome to our earnings conference call. Today we'll be covering results for the first quarter. Gary Hendrickson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is with me on our call this morning.", "Before we begin, I'll direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning, which contains much of the information that we'll be covering in the call. This call is subject to the forward-looking statements language contained in our press release and our comments may include forward-looking statements as that term is defined by Securities law.", "This morning I'll cover our results for the quarter. Gary will make a few comments. And then we'll respond to your questions.", "First quarter sales totaled $885.6 million, a 5.1% increase from the first quarter of 2011. Adjusted for currency and acquisitions, sales were up 3.6%. Adjusted net income per share for the quarter increased to $0.62 in 2012, a 59% increase from $0.39 in 2011. Our press release includes details showing the reconciliation of our reported to our adjusted results. My next comments regarding gross margin and operating expense performance exclude restructuring and acquisition-related charges.", "For the first quarter, our gross margin was 33.5%, up from 31.7% in 2011. Our margins benefited from our carryover pricing actions, moderating raw material costs, previously completed restructuring actions and improved productivity.", "As a rate to revenue, operating expenses were 22.6%, down 60 basis points from 23.2% in the first quarter of 2011 primarily due to leverage on higher sales. Quarter-over-quarter operating expense dollars increased $4.9 million or 2.5%.", "The reported tax rate for the first quarter was 26.4%, down from a rate of 29.3% in the first quarter of last year. The lower rate was due to the geographical mix of earnings and a one-time favorable tax benefit for a foreign subsidiary. This one-time benefit was already anticipated in our full year tax rate guidance, which remains at 30% to 31%.", "Average diluted shares outstanding were 95.5 million, down 4.1 million from last year due to repurchases which were partially offset by options. In the quarter, we repurchased 1.25 million shares for approximately $49 million and have 7 million shares remaining under our current authorization. We estimate average shares outstanding for the second quarter to be approximately 95 million.", "Recapping our sales performance for the quarter, adjusted for currency and acquisitions, our overall core growth was 3.6%, primarily driven by high single-digit price increases which offset a mid single-digit decline in volume. Currency was positive 0.2% and acquisitions added another 1.3% for a total growth of 5.1% in the quarter.", "Looking at our segment results for the quarter, and this is adjusted for currency and acquisitions, our Coatings segment sales increased 6.6%. Sales in this segment benefited from pricing and new business which offset core volume declines. Paints segment sales were flat, reflecting continued weak market conditions in the U.S. and Australia and slowing growth in China, which was offset by the impact of our pricing. Sales in Other increased 2.8%.", "I'm now going to move into a discussion of our EBIT margins for the quarter. All the numbers that I'll be discussing exclude restructuring charges and Wattyl acquisition-related charges in the 2011 period. Our Coatings segment EBIT margin was 15%, up 360 basis points from 11.4% in the first quarter of 2011. The segment benefited from our pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and the impact of previously completed restructuring actions.", "Our Paints segment EBIT margin was 8.1%, up from 7.9% in 2011. The EBIT margin for our Other category was negative-0.3% compared with negative-15% in the first quarter last year. As a reminder, Other includes our corporate expenses. The total company EBIT margin for the quarter was 10.9% compared with 8.4% in the first quarter of 2011.", "Moving to the balance sheet, our net debt at the end of the first quarter was $950 million, an increase of $91 million from the end of last fiscal year. The increase was driven by share repurchases and the normal seasonality of operating cash flows. During the first quarter, our operating cash flow was a use of $25 million compared with a use of $40 million through the first quarter of last year. We estimate free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx and dividends, to be $160 million to $190 million in fiscal year 2012.", "In January, we strengthened our balance sheet by issuing a $400 million 10-year bond with a coupon of 4.2%. We used the proceeds to pay down commercial paper and the remaining funds will be used to pay off the $200 million bond that matures on May 1, 2012.", "Interest expense will peak in the second quarter at approximately $19.5 million due to the timing of the bond payment. Our interest expense for the full year is estimated to be between $68 million and $70 million, up from $62 million last year.", "Our net debt to capital was 43.9%. We ended our quarter with $694 million of reserve liquidity, but included $588 million of available committed credit facilities and $306 million of cash, of which $200 million of the cash will be used to pay for the bond maturing in May.", "Capital spending in the first quarter was $14.5 million, up from $12.1 million in the first quarter of 2011. Our capital spending forecast for the full year is $90 million.", "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $22.7 million, up slightly from $22 million in the first quarter of 2011. Our full year forecast for depreciation and amortization is approximately $90 million.", "As mentioned in our release, we are raising our fiscal year 2012 guidance of adjusted net income per share in the range of $2.92 million to $3.12, which excludes restructuring related charges.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Gary for his comments.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning everyone. We're off to a good start for the year. Against the backdrop of uneven global demand which impacted volumes in a few of our larger businesses, our execution was excellent.", "We were able to improve our operating margins both sequentially and year-over-year through a combination of pricing, productivity and the benefits of previous restructuring actions. Our new business initiatives also contributed positively to our results in the quarter and helped to offset market weakness in the global consumer and packaging product lines. A new business in our coil and general industrial product lines were particularly strong.", "We also continued to do a good job of managing costs. Expenses as a percentage of sales were down were down 60 basis points and up only $5 million year-over-year.", "Before we talk about our outlook for the rest of 2012, let me just provide a little context about this quarter versus Q1 last year. In the first quarter of last year, we were experiencing significant raw material inflation that had not yet been recovered with pricing and our margins were depressed. This year, cost price is better balanced in many of our product lines and we are also seeing the benefits of restructuring and productivity initiatives. For the remainder of our fiscal year, we're planning for a challenging macro environment. We anticipate potential demand challenges across several of our businesses in regions.", "And while we remain guardedly optimistic about the U.S. and Latin America markets, we're cautious about Europe and to a lesser extent China. We also expect this year to be challenged with rising raw material cost. We believe that Q1 was a low point for 2012 and our cost will be up sequentially in Q2. And we expect raw materials inflation for the year of mid-to-high single digits.", "As Lori mentioned, we raised our guidance to $2.92 to $3.12. The assumptions behind this guidance were as just stated, rising raw material cost and demand dynamics that are difficult to predict at this early point in the year but we expect to offset these challenges with new business, pricing when needed, substantial productivity and good management of expenses.", "And with those comments, I'm happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan", "This is Silke Kueck for Jeff. Two questions, in coatings, sales year-over-year were up, I don't know, $38 million. Your profits were up $22.5 million. So the incremental margin was close to 60%. And I was wondering whether you can just discuss really what the incremental benefits, when you look at cost savings versus price from material benefit. And in the middle can you talk about whether you exhibit any no-margin business.", "Gary Hendrickson", "We've got the benefits, Silke, year-over-year from a number of different things. One as I mentioned, cost price was a little bit better in this quarter then it was last year. That was true across most product lines in coatings.", "Your recall at the coatings segment is where we did most of our restructuring last year. So we're seeing those benefits flow through the P&L. Here we have a number of productivity initiatives in most of those businesses that are also benefiting us. And then the last thing, our new business efforts in our coating segment will particularly have been and were in this quarter particularly strong. And because of all the restructuring that we've done in the lower cost structure that we have, that new business is coming in at very healthy incremental margins.", "So those are the main drivers of the improvement that you saw. And then your last question about exiting unprofitable our business not, if we did it wouldn't be material.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Nils Wallin at CLSA.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "Just on coatings again, have you seen any strength so far in any particular end market that had helped the profitability? Is it anything in agro equipment, appliances, construction that drove the solid results?", "Gary Hendrickson", "The agro equipment market has been strong for a number of quarters. But you really know the growth was mostly about our new business initiatives, particularly in our general industrial segments and our coil segment. I wouldn't say that the market per se was particularly strong but our new business efforts were.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "And then just sort of as a follow-up I think there is perhaps something like 5% to 10% unit growth for agro equipment expected for North America this year and maybe 5% to 8% globally. Do you believe that you will be in lined with the market better than, worse than in terms of your own volume growth in that business?", "Gary Hendrickson", "That's one of the segments that we're taking share in and growing and so if it's 5% that to use your number than I would expect to grow faster than 5%.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of John Mcnulty at Credit Suisse.", "Abhi Rajendran - Credit Suisse", "This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. First quick question on the raw materials, you talked about raw is being up mid-to-high single-digits. Could you break out your expectations on TiO2 versus the acrylics chain, especially given some of the recent moves we've seen in propelling?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We tend to think about our entire basket when we give those numbers but it's probably acknowledged that TiO2 suppliers are out with the couple of nominated price increases and we expect to at least part of that will stick. And then the rest of it, is as we look forward if the economy starts to recover and we get supply and demand issues then we'll start to see some of that. And then the price accrued is persistently stuck at around $100 of barrel and that's driving some incremental inflation as well. So that's about as granular as I incur to get.", "Abhi Rajendran - Credit Suisse", "And then the just quick question on China, you mentioned that you are expecting a little bit of weakness there for the coming year. Would you expect that weakness to kind of persist throughout the course of the year or are you seeing current weakness with perhaps the gradual pickup through the rest of the year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think it's the latter. We're planning for that. Our first quarter was relatively weak. The growth rate in our consumer business slowed in the quarter. But we had, as I've said several times on these calls that our main barometer were how we think the Chinese market will do over the relatively near term are the feelings of our distributors at Huarun. We had a meeting with our Huarun distributors last week and they feel confident. They remain committed to their budget numbers for the year.", "Abhi Rajendran - Credit Suisse", "And then one last quick one, if I may, your other expense line came in a little bit lower than you had. Are there any particular drivers behind this? And can with expect this to be more sustainable lower level going forward?", "Lori Walker", "The main driver there is favorable FX and that's just from transaction. And I would imagine it would be roughly equal to last year slightly less. It's not a big number for us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Don Carson at Susquehanna Financial.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial", "Question on packaging, that sub-segments have been weak for I guess, three quarters, yet your overall coatings margin is still doing quite well. So can you describe what exactly the issues are with packaging volumes and what margin impact that's having? And then just quickly on raws I just want to know are you having any success in reformulation specific on TiO2. Have you made attempts to either use lower quality Chinese TiO2 or use acrylic based standards to try and manage your TiO2 cost.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes, we are doing both of those of things and we're using Chinese TiO2 in a number of our businesses not all of them but a number. I'm satisfied that we're doing at least as well as the industry is in terms of substituting other materials for chloride TiO2 and sulfate grade Tio2 from China or Chloride grade. So we're pretty satisfied with our efforts there.", "Packaging volumes, the issue is North America and Europe. Our business in China was great. Our business in Latin America was very good. But the beverage volumes in Europe and North America are weak, weaker than we would expect them to be. And I think that that is a reflection of consumers who are a little bit tighter with their first rings at this point in the economy cycle and they typically are.", "I don't believe that it's structural. You're right. It's been about three quarters. But this has been a very steady business for us for a very long time. And the sly of weakness that we're seeing is a bit unusual. And I believe that it's tied to the recession.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial", "And finally, you beat consensus considerably by almost $0.14. You're only taking up your guidance range by $0.05 is that just due to a higher tax rate in the back half of the year or is it just more your macro-caution on the business?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Don, it's pretty early in the year. And we don't know how it will play out for the rest of the year. And as I said, we've got some challenges we think in some of our end markets. Raw material inflation is still uncertain. So the balance of all those things together will lead us to be maybe a little bit more cautious than you would have expected.", "There is one other factor which is the bond and the incremental interest expense that will be incurring for the remainder of the year which is in fact are going to do some of the models that are out there.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Rosemarie Morbelli at Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Gary, could you us bring up to date on the progress you are making with Wattyl in Australia, talk a little bit about the housing market in Australia as well as the progress of Lowe's and Woolworths adding stores?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Sure. We're pleased with the progress that we've made against our plan in Wattyl, where if not ahead of plan we're certainly on our plan for where we expect it to be at this point in time. We didn't expect the housing market to be as weak as it is and so the volumes in the market are significantly weaker than we would have expected.", "But we're working our way through that. And we are sort of controlling the things that we can control in that respect. The joint venture Masters is the name of Lowe's joint venture. It appears to be doing extremely well. I think they have eight stores open. We want most of the shelf space in those stores with our Lowe brands and most stores are doing very well.", "So we wish the housing market were stronger but we're pleased with the progress that we've made and our restructuring at Wattyl and some of the new business initiatives that we have at Wattyl and we're very pleased with the success that we're having with Masters.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "And then in the coating side, was some of the margin improvement is the direct result of the impairments that you took on the wood coating side. How much did that help?", "Gary Hendrickson", "That had no effect, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Why is Warren comfortable with what is happening in China for the balance of the year? Is it that they see the construction market improving or are there other reasons?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think, we're in the right place. I mean our water headline is about China is about what's happening in Tier 1 cities where our end distributors were not distributing Tier 1 cities. We are in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. And the situation there is different than Tier 1. There is Tier 2 and 3 cities are still growing. So that's one factor. And there is a new Chinese initiative to stimulate first time home buyers and the lower end of the market. And that also is Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. And we're participating in that as well.", "So not that I think that, I think they feel that the Chinese government will manage through in a positive way. Inflation and growth and that we're placed in the right places in the country geographically.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Chris Nocella at Barclays Capital.", "Chris Nocella - Barclays Capital", "Just in your paint segment, your volume growth was impacted by inventories down in the U.S. in Q4. Did you have the same issues in Q1 and what you're expectation for volume growth in this business for the rest of the year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We did not have the same effect in Q1, Chris, you're right we did in Q4. Volume growth and that was a North America phenomenon, last year. And our volume growth sequentially and North America was good. And what we expect for the remainder of the year in North America is that we're hopeful that we'll see growth. And we're planning for flat-to-low single-digit growth in North America.", "As I mentioned, our volumes in Australia were weak because of our housing market. And our volumes in China were weaker than we would have liked because of the slowing market there.", "Chris Nocella - Barclays Capital", "And just on raw materials. Last quarter you mentioned that you're about 10% to 15% of raw material inflation to recover. Are we still going to have that similar level and when do you expect it for a recover cost based on your current expectation for inflation?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We may progress in Q1 in our coating segment. We did not make the progress that we had hoped in our paint segment and several of the significant channels in our paint segment we are still on active discussion with our customers about the need for more pricing.", "In coatings, in some of our product lines were substantially recovered and some of the smaller ones we still need some work.", "Chris Nocella - Barclays Capital", "And in paint, were you able to get price increases throughout this year or are you still under discussion with those?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I'm not sure I understand your question about timing?", "Chris Nocella - Barclays Capital", "Were you able to get price increases through on paint segment this year yet or are you still under negotiation with those?", "Gary Hendrickson", "In some channels we have gotten price and couple of the channels we're still negotiating.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Saul Ludwig at Northcoast Research.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "Gary, could you quantify amount of the dollars of new business that you had in the first quarter of this net new business that you had this year that you didn't have last year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Lori, may be able to get you the dollars, Saul. I know the percentage. The percentage in coatings was mid-single digits.", "Lori Walker", "And overall from a company, Saul, it was in the 2% range.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "In China, was your volume actually down there? I remember you ended the year with, I don't know, was it 2,500 distributors versus 2,000 a year earlier. So with 20% more distribution points, even with that was your volume down?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes, it was pretty much flat. You're talking about the number of stores that we had at the end of the year, Saul, most of those stores were loaded last year. And the sell through on those is what should drive our growth as we go through this year.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "On the issue of additional price increases I know as Sherwin announced on their call that they had an 8% price increase announced at February 1. We understand that Glidden did similar increase. So did you have any such price increase February 1 to commensurate with what we heard from those guys?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We've put price into it recently in our U.S. paint market.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "And will that be broad based?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Not through every channel. We're still negotiating in one of the channels in the U.S. market.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "Are you still putting an additional price increases in coatings or you think you've got price rose pretty much where they need to be?", "Gary Hendrickson", "In some of our product lines, Saul, we still had some recovery to make. And as I mentioned in my opening remarks we think Q1 was the low point. We're starting to see raw material inflation hit again. And as that occurs we'll be having those conversations with our customers about passing that through the consumers or end users.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "And Lori, what was that sequential fourth quarter to first quarter change in raw material cost on the unit basis. It looked like they might have actually been down somewhat?", "Lori Walker", "Yes, they were flat, Saul.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "And what were they year-over-year?", "Lori Walker", "Up, high single-digit.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "And so the real driver of the improved gross margins was that the price rose in coatings or was it the operating cost. I mean at the cost of goods sold level if you stripped out raw materials, what was the change in that's called the bucket of all other cost that weren't raw materials on the year-over-year basis.", "Gary Hendrickson", "No it was three things, Saul, in terms of operating profit which is what we talked about on this call rather than gross margin. It was price cost. It was productivity. It was some new business. It was restructuring. And it was leverage on the expense line.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of James Sheehan at Deutsche Bank.", "James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank", "Just on your comment before on TiO2, you mentioned that you thought some of the price increases may stick. It seem like some of that pricing momentum in TiO2 has slowed down about three months ago, and now it looks like it's picking up again a little bit. Do you think that pricing in TiO2 is going to remain strong through the year or do you see that changing as the season's progress?", "Gary Hendrickson", "There is a difference between pricing momentum and price announcements. And I wouldn't say that there is momentum necessarily because the supply of TiO2 is long, a very long. The world is a washing TiO2. And so how these negotiations play out over the next several months is a still up in the air. And I'm not going to predict on this call.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Bob Koort at Goldman Sachs.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Gary, I was hoping you can help me out a little bit. You embarrassed me with your coating margins. I wasn't even close. But if I look back at history and typically those margins climb as you go through the year. And I think that somebody earlier ask that it sound like you maybe being a little bit conservative with your outlook. So can you taught me into thinking that coatings margins can actually erode through the year or are we going to be able to see you generate these mid-teens levels for the balance of the year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think we're about where we should be, roughly speaking, Bob, as we go into our second quarter and third quarter which are our highest volume quarters, we're going to get more operating leverage out of these businesses and they might expand somewhat. That's what they normally do. But I think, where we are right now is a reasonable place for us to be.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And you're going to have plenty of cash flow, you mentioned the bond offering. If you look at your coatings portfolio, there is only a couple of spots where you are not active. Is there any desire to round out the portfolio with the marine or auto businesses, OEM businesses?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Not at this stage.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And then you mentioned, new product initiatives generate some pretty meaningful volume increases. Maybe this is a too big of a softball for a CEO, but can you tell me what some of those are explicitly or where the bigger ones might be?", "Gary Hendrickson", "The ones that we've been talking about for a number of quarters now, Bob, the coil business is doing really well, particularly in Latin America. North America was good and Eastern Europe were growing in our coil business. At general industrial business I talked about the segments that were doing reasonably well earlier relative to the off road segments but we're doing well there.", "We're doing well in pipe coatings and we're doing we're doing well in container coatings and our powder coatings business was good. So a pretty broad spectrum of new business initiatives for us that are paying nice dividends for us.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And one last, if I may, I recognize your reluctance to be too specific on pricing through the retail channels on your paint business. There is multiple vendors at the various channels you sell so is it typical to see those vendors all increase prices at a similar time or is it possible that you get some to-and-fro in the supplier based to some of your bigger customers?", "Gary Hendrickson", "It's a hard question to ask. I mean, normally you try to get the pricing in the off season for paints. That's the one your sort of generic comment that I'd make about it but with inflation as volatile as it's been over the last few years. I think some of the normal pricing dynamics have changed a bit, just in terms of timing and retail leadership et cetera.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of P. J. Juvekar at Citi.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citi", "You had gained market share at lows over the last couple of years. Are you continuing to gain share there or do you think trends have sort of plateaud out now that everyone has a paint plus primer in one product?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think we're holding our own. If you're talking about gaining share within the paint department there I'd just say that we're holding our own.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citi", "So in last couple of years, as you gain share, but do you think this year you can hold your share?", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're making assumption. I don't recall that we're saying that we were gaining share at Lowe's on one of these calls. So what we have been doing is changing our mix pretty substantially at Lowe's and selling our higher price point products. We drove consumers up to our high def paint and signatures is continues to do well. So we shifted our mix in that channel, but I think we've held our own in terms of market share over the last couple of years.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citi", "So you had a better mix. And then secondly on coatings, when you answered all several previous questions, I think you mentioned your core volumes declined in coatings. But then ag-equipment was strong, coil and industrial growth was strong, pipe coating was strong. So was it all packaging, coating that sort of led to the declines?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Packaging was a bit weak and our wood coatings were bit weak in the quarter, P. J.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citi", "And so those two basically were more than offset the growth in other areas, is that how would you put it?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Steve Schwartz at First Analysis.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Just one question left, inventory in the retail channel. I think you commented on the last call, that things were a bit light. I'm just wondering where you think they might stand at this point?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think they are okay. I think they are in good shape as we go into the painting season. The industry will start to build inventory as we get closer to spring. Right now I would say they are in pretty good shape.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. So not heavy, not light?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Correct.", "Operator", "We'll go next to line of Dmitry Silversteyn at Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "A lot of my questions have been already answered. But I just wanted to dig in a little bit into the cautious outlook you have in China. I mean it sounded like the first quarter you were kind of flattish there in the Huarun business. I'm assuming you're expecting some growth in the region for 2012 given that your distributors have reaffirmed the outlook and I am assuming the outlook originally was for growth. Second question would be on the Valspar brand that you have introduced or are introducing into the Chinese market. How is that doing and where do you see that business going in 2012, given maybe a little bit lower outlook for the Tier 1 cities?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I tell you that our distributors are very excited about it. And they see it as a great complement to Huarun. So they have got the opportunity to sell to the Chinese consumer and wants a foreign brand at a high price point as well as the Chinese who are in. So we've got a number of retail stores opened in China now. They're doing particularly well. We have retail showroom in Shanghai.", "But as I said, Dmitry, this initiative we don't plan for this to move the dial for this year or probably for next year. It will be something that we roll out gradually over time. We're not investing a lot of Valspar money and our distributors are making the investments. But as I said, they're behind it and relative to the total company, it's not going to move the dial, but it's an exciting initiative for our distributors in China.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Second question on the Wattyl and the Australian business, you mentioned that Masters joint venture has now opened up eight stores. Do you know what the roadmap of store openings for them is for the next couple of years? And secondly, 2012 I'm still thinking of as a margin improvement year for Wattyl. Can we start thinking about 2013 as kind of the growth year for that business?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, we're growing with Masters. We have a number of other growth initiatives occurring in Wattyl. Dmitry, you might remember that we lost the budding business. So that set us back a little bit. That was about $30 million in business. And we tend to think of the business that we're winning at Masters as the offset to that. And a breakeven for that is probably the number of stores that might be opened by the end of this year for Masters.", "So that's how we're thinking about growth in that particular channel, the retail channel. But we sell through other channels and to drive market we sell through independent paint stores and we sell through our own stores. And we've got growth initiatives in place in both our stores business and our independent business. If we're successful in those, we're going to start to see growth even this year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "And as far as margin improvement in the operations, from what I remember, it was in the 3% to 4% operating margin business when you bought it. A year into ownership, have you moved the needle there significantly?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No, not significantly, but there was no plan to move it significantly in this year. We think about it in terms of a three-to-five year timeframe, Dmitry. And built into our guidance and our plans for the year, there wasn't a significant amount of improvement in the Wattyl business.", "If you do the math, it was 4% times $400 million was $16 million. So even if we improved it 4%, it's only $16 million in a $4 billion company. So we're not pushing those guys to do anything for the short term that would hurt us in the long term. So we're taking our time and we're making sure that we do things correctly.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "But over the three-to-five year period, do you think that that business can get to kind of your average paints margin of about 8% to 9%?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think you can do better than that.", "Operator", "We go to the line of Andrew Don at KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Andrew Don - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Just a couple of quick questions here looking at your packaging, coatings again. I think last quarter, you were telling about a particularly weak pack season that was affecting volumes. I'm wondering if you guys have any further visibility from your clients into what the spring season might look like.", "Gary Hendrickson", "We really won't know until the crops are in and harvested. We really don't get a point of view on this, Andrew, until late spring.", "Andrew Don - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "And then shifting to China also, you mentioned that kind of 30-plus figure as the number of additional lines you're looking incoming in Southeast Asia. I was wondering if you might be able to provide us any further granularity on the timing of those expansions. And then just kind of assuming that you maintain your current share to handle the volume, is that kind of baked into these capacity expansions that you're going to go through at your South China facilities or would that require additional expansion as you think about that going forward?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We think we'll get our fair share of that growth. We'll have to get back to you on what that number is and our plan for the next couple of years. But we will have to expand one of our plants in China to accommodate the growth that is occurring in China, and that is in our capital plan for the year. Lori talked about the $90 million plan. It's in that plan.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Mike Hamilton at RBC.", "Mike Hamilton - RBC", "Wondering if the timing of Chinese New Year has any impact?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No. That's a Q2 event for us, Mike, and it was a Q2 event last year.", "Mike Hamilton - RBC", "Could you give some comments on your strategic initiatives in Asia? Is there anything worth noting on the efforts and giving us an update?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I'll only say that we're pleased with where we are particularly with the container business. At all of our businesses in Asia, this quarter performed reasonably well. Some performed very well. And we're expecting that we're going to have a good year, particularly in our industrial businesses. That could be a long conversation.", "Mike Hamilton - RBC", "Finally, you've done such a nice job in new customer penetration. Is there anything in terms of new product where you're making inroads, where you weren't a quarter or two ago?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No, none that comes to mind, Mike. I think this quarter was a continuation of what we've been seeing and particularly in our industrial businesses for the last couple of quarters.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli at Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Back to the new products, could you give us a feel for how successful you are on the Valspar Plus paint for people with asthma and allergy? Do you see this growing substantially or is it just a small addition?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, it's a niche product and it's growing. Each week, it seems to get a bit stronger, but that's a niche product for us, Marie, at a very high price point for particular consumer segment.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "And that is sold through Lowe's as well?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "And then, if I may, could you touch about your intention on debt repayment between now and the end of the year outside of the $200 million which you have raised the money for, and then stock repurchase between now and the end of the year as well?", "Lori Walker", "Well, in terms of that debt repayment, you're correct. We would be paying down the bond that matures here in May. And then from a share repurchase standpoint, we've commented on numerous calls that our intent is to get guarantee that we offset dilution. Longer-term intent is to reduce our share count 2% a year. And we still have 7 million shares remaining under our authorization.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Lori, besides the $200 million, your cash flow generation is usually strong on an annualized basis and you just raised the $400 million. So any sort of paying down additional debts in that?", "Lori Walker", "Well, the options for us in terms of what we do with that cash is to use it for internal growth initiatives, paying dividends which you could expect us to do. Acquisitions and share repurchases were both an option. And then of course paying down debt, but the majority of our debt remaining would be commercial paper and it's at a relatively good rate. So we'll probably use our cash in other ways besides paying down debt.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan", "It's Silke again. Of the $0.33 in restructuring charges of which most has been taken, what would be associated cost savings and how much have you gotten in the first quarter?", "Lori Walker", "We haven't gone into any detail in terms of the savings other than to say that it's built into our guidance for the full year. And we still have summary structuring costs remaining that will flow in probably over the next couple of quarters.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan", "So what percentage of your anticipated savings may have gotten in the first quarter?", "Lori Walker", "I actually don't even know the number. It certainly has helped us from the overall gross margin improvement, as Gary mentioned earlier in the conversation that those initiatives are helping us.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up from the line of James Sheehan at Deutsche Bank.", "James Sheehan - Deutsche Bank", "Just on Europe, you mentioned that volumes were weak there. And I am just curious is that still confined to packaging coatings or is it spread to other product lines? And also, for your 2012 outlook, you said you were still cautious on Europe. Do you think the situation in Europe has stabilized there or you're expecting further deterioration?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I'll only be speculating on the second part, James. On the first part, as I mentioned, we grew nicely in our coil coatings business in Europe despite the market weakness. But our general industrial business was weaker than we would have liked, and our packaging businesses, et cetera, was a bit weak as well, particularly in beverage segment.", "Operator", "We next have a follow-up from the line of Steve Schwartz at First Analysis.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "If I could ask additionally about your packaging business, is the majority of that coatings business for metal packaging?", "Gary Hendrickson", "It's virtually all of it.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "And then what would be the approximate split of that business between aluminum beverage cans versus like steel food cans and so forth? Is it about 50-50?", "Gary Hendrickson", "The beverage segment would be larger for us than the food segment would be.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "One of the major aluminum producers has 2012 forecast for beverage can packaging out there, and they're saying maybe 2% to 3% growth globally with notable growth in Europe and large growth in China. Does that match how you expect '12 to play out?", "Gary Hendrickson", "More or less, yes, I think that sounds right to me. I think China is growing double digits. Latin America may grow double digits, I would think at least high single digits. And Europe and the U.S. may remain weak. We'll just have to see how the year plays out.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "So there is no reason for us to be concerned that maybe you're losing share in that business?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We are not losing share in that business.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from the line of Saul Ludwig at Northcoast Research.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "Two things. The acquisition pipeline looks like these days you got a lot of money to spend. Is there ample opportunities that are being pursued?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We're working on a few things, Saul, as we always are. But I'll say that there is nothing imminent.", "Saul Ludwig - Northcoast Research", "Your Hi-DEF has now been out for a few years. It's been a great success. That was sort of a high-end paint primer combo, so to speak. And now there has been some lower price competitive paint primer combination products introduced. Your mainline is Valspar Ultra Premium. Do you have to move in the direction of a paint primer combination in a more popular price point as part of your strategy going forward?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Let me just say this. We're only six weeks away from the launch of our marketing for 2012. So I respectfully decline to answer your question. You'll just have to wait and see what we're doing this year.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from the line of John McNulty at Credit Suisse.", "Abhi Rajendran - Credit Suisse", "Hi, this is Abhi Rajendran recalling in for John. We're not too far away from hearing from the FDA on their thoughts on BPA. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about your expectations in terms of their announcement and maybe just remind us of your BPA-free coating options that you have in your portfolio at the moment?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I don't know what they'll say except to probably reiterate their longstanding position that it's safe. That being said, consumers may request that can makers make a change. And if they do that, we're fully prepared for that to happen with the technology that we have developed and commercialized in some cases and then on the shelf, so to speak, if we need to go in that direction.", "Operator", "And there is a follow-up from the line of Jeff Zekauskas at JPMorgan.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan", "If the DuPont Performance Coatings business came up for sale, would you be interested in any piece of the business or the whole business, because it seems there is powder coatings business and there is like a auto OEM and auto refinish business?", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're probably not going to participate in that. It's a little too big a bite for us.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan", "And so they were in pieces of it that were to become available, sale of the whole division?", "Gary Hendrickson", "As I understand, it's the sale of a whole division. So any talk about pieces rather would be just speculation.", "Operator", "And at this time, presenters, there are no further questions in queue. I'll turn it back to you.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Thanks for joining our call this morning, everyone. To summarize, we're off to a good start to the year. We see a number of challenges in our global markets, but we believe we can offset them with excellent execution and we raised our full year guidance to $2.92 to $3.12 per share. Thanks again for joining the call today and we look forward to updating you on our second quarter conference call in May.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Wells", "Thanks, Jackie. In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release. ", "Summarizing overall company performance for the first quarter 2012 versus first quarter 2011, consolidated net sales increased 15.1% to $2.14 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volume and selling price increases. The combination of acquisitions and currency translation had little effect on sales in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $112.4 million for the quarter to $909.8 million. Gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 42.6% of sales from 43% in the first quarter last year.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $66.6 million over first quarter last year to $557.7 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 35.5% in the quarter this year from 37.2% last year. Interest expense decreased $338,000 compared to first quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $47.6 million or 50% to $142.3 million. ", "Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 29.6% compared to 27.9% in the first quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the low 30% range compared to last year's rate of 40.4%. As a reminder, our 2011 income tax expense included a onetime income tax charge of approximately $75 million to satisfy our settlement with the IRS. ", "Consolidated net income increased $31.9 million to $100.2 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 4.7% compared to 3.7% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased to $0.95 per share from $0.63 per share in 2011.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. For our Paint Stores Group in first quarter 2012, sales increased 20.9% to $1.12 billion from $929.3 million last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 20.4%. The increase in sales for the segment was due primarily to higher paint sales volumes across all end market segments and higher selling prices. Regionally, in the first quarter, our Midwest division led all divisions, followed by the Eastern division, Southwestern division and Southeastern division. ", "Segment profit for the group increased 63.7% to $112.7 million in the quarter, as higher sales volume and selling pricing increases more than offset higher raw material costs and SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 10% from 7.4% in the first quarter last year.", "Turning to the Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter increased 8.6% to $320.4 million as a result of selling price increases and volume increases. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased 34.6% in the quarter to $55.3 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 17.3% from 13.9% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued tight expense control and price increases that were partially offset by raw material cost increases. ", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 11% to $483.1 million in the quarter due primarily to higher paint sales volume, selling price increases and acquisitions. In the quarter, acquisitions increased net sales by 3.9%, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased sales by 2.3%. First quarter segment profit increased 47.3% to $28.6 million due to higher sales volume and selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Currency rate changes and acquisition had no significant impact on segment profits in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 5.9% from 4.5% in the same period last year. ", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales increased 7.1% to $208.6 million due primarily to selling price increases and higher sales volumes, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 5.6% in the quarter. Stated in US dollars, segment profit in the quarter increased 14.5% to $19.9 million due primarily to higher sales volume and price increases partially offset by raw material cost inflation. Currency translation rate changes decreased segment profits by $1.4 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 9.5% in the quarter compared to 8.9% in the first quarter 2011.", "Turning now to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2012, was $1.32 billion including total short-term borrowings of $677 million. Total debt on March 31, 2011, was $1.34 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $25.5 million compared to $53.9 million at the end of first quarter 2011. Total borrowings to capitalization were 46.7% at the end of the quarter versus 45.4% at the end of the first quarter last year. Long-term debt to capitalization was 22.8% at the end of the quarter this year compared to 22.4% last year.", "In the first quarter 2012, we spent $32.8 million on capital expenditure. Depreciation expense was $37.9 million, and amortization expense was $6.6 million. For the full year this year, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $130 million to $150 million, depreciation will be about $150 million and amortization will be about $30 million. ", "I'll conclude this review with a brief comment on the status of our lead litigation. In California, the Santa Clara case involving 8 cities and counties in California and 5 former lead pigment manufacturers, continue to move through the discovery phase. A pretrial hearing is scheduled for May 22, and the court has set a trial date of September 10, 2012. Once discovery is completed, the parties will have the opportunity to file dispositive pretrial motions.", "That concludes our review of the results for first quarter 2012, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thank you, Bob. And good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The preannouncement we issued on April 9 took some of the suspense out of today's release. Our practice is to update guidance when it becomes apparent that we will exceed the top end of our original EPS range by the greater of 10% or $0.10 per share. Our results in the first quarter easily cleared both of these hurdles. Response to our preannouncement also gave us insight into some of the questions you're likely to have regarding our results for the quarter. And I'm sure you'll have some additional questions, but let me take a few minutes to address the obvious ones, namely, the sustainability of the strong demand we experienced in the quarter, the current trajectory of raw material costs and the success of our recent price increases.", "Starting with the demand front. First quarter consolidated volumes net of acquisitions grew at the strongest pace we've seen since the first quarter of 2004. Compared to our performance in the first quarter of last year, demand strengthened in virtually every product category, with every customer segment in every geographic region. While it's difficult to quantify the impact of favorable weather in the United States had on first quarter volumes, we are certain it did have some positive impact. We're equally certain that the strong sales trends in the quarter are an indication that market demand is, in fact, improving. ", "Let me offer a couple of data points from our Paint Stores Group that I think support these conclusions. First, exterior paint sales volumes grew at a faster pace than interior, which does suggest an early start to the exterior painting season. However, both exterior and interior grew at double-digit rates in both revenues and gallons. Second, we looked at our sales results by geographic region. As Bob pointed out in his comments, our 2 northern Paint Stores divisions turned into strongest year-over-year sales increases, which would again suggest some weather impact. However, 3 of our 4 divisions grew sales by more than 20%, and the fourth was up in the high teens. The spread from the highest growth rate to the lowest was just over 5 percentage points. ", "We think this data confirms that there was likely some weather benefit in our first quarter results with equally convincing evidence that fundamental demand in the market is strengthening. Even with the volume improvement we saw in the quarter, the good news is that the market still has a long way to go to get back to what we consider to be sustainable levels.", "Sales volume growth, particularly by our Paint Stores Group, was the overriding reason earnings came in above our initial expectations. Consolidated gross margins in the quarter declined 40 basis points year-over-year, primarily to the annualization of the raw material inflation we experienced in the last 9 months of 2011. Although the price of high-grade chloride titanium dioxide continues to rise, the magnitude of the price increase announcements has diminished in recent quarters and global demand for TiO2 has softened, but it remains to be seen whether these increases will be fully implemented. At this point, however, year-over-year raw material cost inflation appears to be on pace with the high single digit to low teens rate we anticipated for the year, with most of the pressure coming from titanium dioxide.", "We continue to make progress in implementing the price increases required to offset these raw material cost headwinds. In the quarter, pricing contributed just over half of the increase in our consolidated sales. As our Paint Stores Group makes further progress in the October and February announcements, the impact to pricing and revenues should increase modestly in the second quarter, again, which should result in sequential gross margin expansion. It appears that the first quarter will be our most challenging quarter from a cost price standpoint. ", "Working capital for the company, which is inventories plus receivables minus payables, decreased as a percent of sales to 12.7% from 13.9% in the first quarter last year. The change in working capital accounts and the increase in net income each added approximately $30 million to net operating cash in the quarter. This increase in net operating cash was offset by a payment of $59 million to the IRS to complete our 2011 tax settlement.", "During the quarter, we acquired 1.8 million shares of the company stock for treasury at an average cost of $100.44 per share for a total investment of $181 million. By March 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire 19.25 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, up from $0.365 last year, keeping our string of 34 consecutive years of dividend increases intact.", "We also continued to invest in our control distribution platform during the quarter. Paint Stores Group added 5 net new stores, bringing our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,455 stores compared to 3,397 one year ago. Our plan continues to call for Paint Stores Group to add approximately 60 to 65 net new store locations during 2012.", "Looking ahead, we remain cautious in our outlook on raw material costs, but are increasingly convinced that the improvement in market demand we've seen over the past few quarters will prove durable. We anticipate that our consolidated net sales in the second quarter will increase 10% to 15% compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $1.92 to $2.07 per share compared to last year's record performance of $1.66 per share. ", "For the full year 2012, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2011 by a high single digit to low teens percentage. With the annual sales at that level, we've increased our expectations for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $5.75 to $6.05 per share compared to $4.14 per share earned in 2011.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now the team would be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from P.J. Juvekar of Citigroup.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "SG&A spending was up almost 10% year-over-year. I was wondering if there was any pull forward or promotions or marketing expenses from spring season into 1Q.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "P.J., this is Sean Hennessy. And we marginally spent a little more SG&A on merchandising and advertisement, but really no pull forward. I think that the advertising plan that we -- had planned in the first quarter we ended up doing. I think the majority of that, when you take a look at that SG&A increases with the sales increase that we had, I think the hours in the stores and start seeing us putting more service hours in the store to make sure that the customer service is maintained. So our SG&A did go down as a percent of sales. It did have an increase as a percentage, you did mention. But when the gallons are going that way, you're going to see us continue to add service in the store to make sure that proper customer service is handled.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And secondly, what are you seeing in the DIY versus the contractor channel? And is the contractor business coming back sustainably in your opinion?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, P.J., both of those segments, as we commented, had strong quarters for the company. Speaking on our Stores business, specifically, the DIY business also enjoyed a double-digit sales, which is consistent with the performance we've been seeing in the DIY side of that now for the last 5 or 6 quarters. The good news in the quarter, and the one that we've been saying should come at some time, was the strength in the contractor segment, again, across all segments. And for us, that will be the new residential painting contractor, the commercial painting contractor, property management, the residential repaint. All of these segments are clicking and generating strong sales and volume gains.", "Operator", "Our next question's coming from Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chris, with regard to your same-store sales growth of 20.4% in Paint Stores, will you elaborate on how much of that might have been derived from volume versus price in the quarter roughly?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think we've been commenting, Kevin, that our price impact in the Stores business had been in the high single digits over the last kind of third and fourth quarter of last year. That trend continued into the first quarter of this year. So slightly more than half of that lift for the company in the segment for the quarter was volume.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, given the trends that you're seeing on raw materials, have you taken any very recent price actions since the 8% increase that I believe you were implementing for Feb 1? Or would that be likely in your view?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Okay. No additional pricing activity has taken place since the February announcement to our stores. As is our practice with the investment community, we don't preannounce any pricing activities. We cover that off with our customers first and then provide great transparency to you. So no comments on that at this time.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Fair enough. And then finally, Chris, on the splits on the exterior architectural coatings versus interior, I think you mentioned that those were up double digits. Would you care to comment on the magnitude of that spread and how that would compare to normal trends with an eye toward disentangling the weather effects?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. It's a little meaningless in the first quarter because, historically, our interior gallons are much, much greater as they should be at that time of the year than exterior gallons. So the percentage improvement, one relative to the other, kind of skews that. I think the point that we'd like to make sure that the investment community understands is that the interior gallons were up double digit, and that really gives us the confidence of the underlying strength in the market. So exterior gallons outpaced that. It was a good quarter for that, but it's the interior numbers that really drove the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was wondering about your Latin American operations. Do you use chloride-based TiO2 there or sulfate-based TiO2?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Predominantly chloride.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And is there very much of a price difference between chloride-based TiO2 these days and sulfate-based TiO2 on average?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Jeff, I don't have any data of -- at my fingertips on the spread. I do know that a spread has opened up between chloride and sulfate. I don't know what that spread is on the spot market.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, are you looking at any large acquisitions this year, or what's the probability that Sherwin-Williams might make a multibillion-dollar acquisition in 2012?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. Jeff, I think inappropriate to prospectively comment on acquisitions. I think the best guidance for you is to look at the historical way the company's approached that. Our track record has been to really find these terrific bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen our control distribution platform in the Americas or add technology to us. And to the extent that we can continue to find those that add shareholder value, we'll do those. I think that's all we have to say on that at this time.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So a big acquisition, the probability would be pretty small?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, just the logic of how many of those targets remain in the industry, so -- I mean, I wouldn't care to comment on that one way or the other.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "First, Chris, I just have to compliment you on knowing the underlying chemical makeup of the TiO2 in Latin America. Impressive. So just one big picture question. You gave great data to understand the breadth of the recovery. I guess just in your professional opinion, kind of the gut reaction, what's the best answer as to why? Why do you think it's so broad-based? And what happened of late that's kind of turned the corner for this for the consumer?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Dennis, we've been commenting for a while about the unsustainable gallon volume numbers for the American professional coatings industry. And as you recall, after a rough start to the year last year with negative volumes, flattening out in the second, slightly up in the third and then trending better in the fourth, I think we commented on the fourth quarter call that that momentum would be continuing to carry through. We were confident there was pent-up demand for normal maintenance and decorating that was needed to be addressed. And I think as -- we just said 4 years is an awful long cycle to go through, that the past cycles would show that this would start to rebound. We expected the contractor share of the end market would rebound back towards the 50% more historic run rate level, and that having gained share in the downturn that we feel in good position to capitalize on it. And all those factors kind of started to come to fruition in the first quarter.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "Okay, I appreciate that. And then, the second comment, I imagine you'd normally only dream about double-digit volume growth. So now that you've seen it and you've seen how the cost structure reacts, what would you say, relative to your expectation heading into this year, about your ability to lever volume in which you found in the first quarter relative to that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think we feel very good about the leverage that we've had. If you look at the flow-through that Stores had, and I think we've made comments for many, many years that when we give volume, we'd have flow-through and last year [ph], we used to talk about 3%. And once we got past 3%, you'd see it. And then after the downturn that Chris talked about with the volumes in North America and when you take a look at the increases in the flow-through we had in the first quarter, we feel pretty good about the operations and net of gallons continue -- will continue to flow through operating profit.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "So Sean, is it fair to say that what you saw in the expense leverage is what you would have expected for this, given level of volume?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "First question, looking at the 260 basis points of margin improvement in the Paint Stores segment in the quarter, I don't think you got any help with the gross margin line there, so it was all leverage. Sean, what kind of -- what does that tell us about the opportunity for further margin expansion or the cadence thereof over the rest of this year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. Chuck, as I'm sure you recall, 15.5% operating margins was our peak at Stores Group and that happened in 2007. And as the volume went down -- last year, we were in the 13s. So we take a look at it. We think that -- we always felt that the 15.5% was not a -- not just a onetime event. I think that we thought that eventually we could get back to that point in the way that we structured and the way that we've continued to build out the Stores group, we feel that that's not the ceiling. That we think, eventually, we'll be above that 15.5% operating margin.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "You think you'll hit it this year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, we don't forecast segments and so forth. So -- but I'll tell you what, first quarter is up 2.6%. We were 13.1% in the year. If we did that every quarter, we'd be at 15.7%. We're not forecasting our -- we're not giving guidance for that though, Chuck.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "I read you, I read you. It was pretty impressive. Am I right though, you had gross profit margin pressure in Paint Stores in the quarter?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. In the Q, when you get a chance, when we submit our Q and a add-on line [ph], you're going to see that the incremental gross margin dollars were up $80 million. That will be what we write and so right there you'll see that that will show you that's where we were.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. When you look across your various paint lines, whether it's DIY or contractor brands or it's Pratt & Lambert or Dutch Boy or Sherwin-Williams, with the price increases that we've seen, what quality levels were your customers buying in the quarter? Maybe there's not a general answer to this, but were they trading up for quality? Were they affected? Is product mix affected by price?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. We've commented on that historically, Chuck, and I think the same trends are in effect here. We continue to enjoy the modest shift mix towards better quality products. Again, if the contractor business has strengthened, they tend to be a high-quality purchaser to reduce their labor costs. So all good news there, nothing new to report.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. And in the rest of the year, you're going to have -- well, I guess more for the second quarter by a 10% price tailwind. With this kind of volume growth, it seems to me your sales expectation is a little conservative. Would that be a fair way to characterize it?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. We've also got some -- we're taking a look at the currency and someone mentioned Latin America Group earlier. Latin America Group had a pretty sizable currency and you look at what's happened in Real, and you look what happens with the Mexican peso and then euro. Last year, the euro was about $1.34. Right now, we're watching the euro. So I think -- we don't do segments, but I think if you look at the segments, that'll probably tell you that of all the segments, we think probably Stores Group is going to lead us again in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Brian Maguire for Bob this morning. Just one other data point on that is something you could provide. Maybe just comment on the inter-quarter trend you saw there and how that -- those volume numbers really trended, particularly at the end of the first quarter when you got into some more normal weather patterns and maybe even into April if you got any data you could share?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think that the quarter was pretty steady throughout all 3 months, which again, back to your comment, Brian, should give some comment to the underlying market strength as opposed to the particular weather. The best day we had in the quarter was February 29 because leap year goes up against nothing. When you're a retailer, leap year matters. But other than that, it was just really a very solid quarter throughout the entire 3 months.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great, yes. And then looking at the difference between the Consumer growth and the Paint Stores growth, you try and extrapolate the volume growth and Consumer, maybe it was low-single -- low- to mid-single digit volume growth. But it seemed like maybe 1/2 to -- 1/3 to 1/2 of what it was at the Paint Stores. How do you kind of reconcile the big difference in the volume growth between those 2 channels?", "Christopher M. Connor", "There's a couple of things. We don't -- the reason we always -- when we try to give you a flavor for the comp stores is really for pricing. We don't really release unit volume gallon, just volume throughout the Consumer, because in Consumer you have Thompson there. You have Minwax. You have brushes, rollers, caulk, frame and paint. So unit movement is really tough to see, but there's no doubt that the Stores Group was definitely stronger than in the Consumer. But there was a lot of other moving parts in that Consumer relating to a lot of other product lines.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then -- and just one last question, if I might, on the -- your inventory levels. Have you been doubling inventory? Or -- we've heard from some of the -- 2 producers, that they continue to see de-stocking in their chains. Have you tried to take advantage of some of the softness there to do some pre-buying, or building your inventory levels? I guess you're kind of peaking on your inventory levels now or as you head into the more normal painting season. But any sense of any change versus 1 year ago in the inventory?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We always build inventory in the first quarter. If you watch, we do have enough capacity to supply every gallon of paint that we sell in June, July and August. So there's such a sales curve in our business. In the first quarter, we're always going to build inventory. If you look at it, we feel pretty good about where our inventories are. We had more inventory in finished goods last year. But last year, there was a lot of concerns about titanium dioxide shortages or raw material shortages, and that's really what drove it last year. We find that pre-buying or doing different things with different raw materials, the efficiencies of our operation, we're better off -- instead of having more invested, the amount that you're going to pre-buy or pre-produce really doesn't change a great deal so -- versus trying to find locations to bring that inventory in and handle it multiple times. So we feel this quarter was a pretty normal quarter. It went up against last year where we did pre-build some finished goods inventory. But this year's pretty normal, and we feel pretty good at where we're at.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "A question on -- first on guidance. I know you beat the midpoint of your original first quarter guidance by about $0.30, yet you're only taking up your full year guidance by about $0.38. As we get into the seasonally strong second quarter, shouldn't this emerging volume recovery both in the overall market and contractor sales lead to more earnings leverage?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. Don, I would tell you that typically -- we talked about the sales curve here. The first quarter is our lowest and smallest quarter. So when you put that gallon through, that has a nice effect on us. And I think that typically, I would tell you it's a -- very few times have we changed our full year guidance after the first quarter up or down because sometimes we'll actually say, a good week in June takes care of a month of February -- a bad month of February. But when you sit there and take a look at it, the first -- the full year guidance, there's a lot of different things moving in and out. And you typically, in the first quarter, we'll see what happens in the second and third. Someone had just mentioned to me that the last time we had 20% comp store gains were back in 1994. So to sit there and say that that occurred at the smallest quarter of the year -- will that continue in the larger ones? But it's only happened once in the last 18 years. So to project that out to the next 3 quarters, we don't have that in our guidance.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "A question for Chris on your view of the overall market. I think by your numbers, you're showing, what, 612 million gallons of U.S. volumes last year for the industry, which was down slightly. What kind of recovery do you see this year in percentage terms? And do you still think that maybe 700 million-plus is the normalized level for the U.S. market?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Don, we're absolutely convinced that over 700 million gallons is the normalized volume level for the U.S. market. That would indicate that housing starts would be back over 1 million, 1.2 million, 1.3 million perhaps. Existing home turnover numbers would be back to more normalized run rates in the plus or minus 6 million units per year, and then a more normalized maintenance and decorating schedule. So as we come out of this historic downturn in volumes and to your point, negative again last year to 612 million, we think there's a several year ramp-up here of maybe 2x, 3x the GDP growth, which has been the historical growth rate for architectural gallons. And to Sean's point, it's very difficult after one quarter and the lightest quarter of the year to indicate that that's going to be that strong going forward. We do take great comfort in all the anecdotal conversations that we have with thousands and thousands of painting contractors in our stores every day and listen to them talk about the work they have lined up for the year, the fact that they're hiring crews and adding painters to their teams or purchases of the kinds of equipment and materials that they would need for a busy season are ramping up as well. So all these would indicate to us is that 612 million gallon number that the industry saw last year should, in fact, be moving towards the positive direction. And time will tell how long it takes us to get back up over 700 million gallons.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Just wanted to follow through on the raw materials situation. You gave kind of your expectations for the year, which should maintain at high single digit to low teens. If you look at the impact of raw materials had on your quarter, can you talk about both on year-over-year and quarter-on-quarter basis what you saw and what you expect to see in the second quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, Dmitry. Without getting too specific, the first quarter would obviously have the most annualization impact in it from the inflation that we saw in 2011. So with a high single digit to low teens expectation for the year, even if there was very little incremental inflation from Jan 1 to March 31, you would expect that first quarter raw material costs would be at the high end of that range for the year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "On year-over-year basis?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And versus the fourth quarter, your raw materials kept going up, and I would imagine that the fourth quarter raw materials purchases flowed through your P&L in the first quarter. So was raw material actually a benefit to your margins in the first quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No. There was some incremental inflation from 4Q to 1Q sequentially.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Was there a deflation in 4Q versus 3Q of last year, do you remember?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No. Each quarter, with the increase of our raw materials, the increases occurred. Second quarter was higher than the first quarter. The third quarter was higher than the second quarter. And the fourth quarter was higher than third quarter.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "So you didn't see the raw materials declining in the fourth quarter like most other petrochemical purchasers have seen?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, we didn't necessarily make that comment with reference to any specific component of the raw material basket, but the basket in total inflated each quarter last year, primarily driven by titanium dioxide.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. Okay, that's helpful. Okay. And the second question, obviously, double-digit rate of growth may not be sustainable. Certainly, I don't think it's sustainable for the year. But do you think at least high single digits is possible as we get into the second quarter that, in other words, whatever external paint demand was pulled into the first quarter should not -- as you mentioned, it wasn't meaningful enough to impact, assuming weather cooperates, the normal painting season in the second quarter. So you're still looking -- I'm assuming you're still looking for close to double-digit growth in volumes in the second quarter of the year as well.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, we did forecast sales at 10% to 15%, and I think that that's the consolidated number. And I think that when you take a look at it, Chris mentioned how much was the selling price was for the Stores Group, but I think that you make your thoughts on that.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then final question, given that you probably have more volume leverage, I would assume in your Stores Group than in the Consumer Group, and your Stores Group volumes look like they were stronger year-over-year in terms of growth versus the Consumer Group. What's accounting for the fact that your margins in the Consumer Group expanded so much more than it did in the Paint Store Group?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I think, number one, they had a nice sales gain, and I think that they've been working on some margin improvement. And I think that if you look at the Stores Group, we were increased on our SG&A. We're feeling that whereas in the Consumer Group, you don't see it. And then [indiscernible] the takes as the Consumer Group is making the paint for the Paint Stores Group. And so when you see that volume increase, you'll see that they do get the benefit of that.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "On the gross margin side, but not necessarily on the -- not necessarily in the operating margin side, right, because you don't have the fixed cost of your stores in the Consumer Group?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right, which is why I'm saying that when the one went from 7.4% to 10%, which was pretty strong, we feel pretty good about it, Consumer actually grew faster than that and that's because of the incremental SG&A that went into Stores.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. And that incremental SG&A, was that just considered a onetime campaigns and setting up posters and new displays? Or is it going be an ongoing...", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, it was headcount. I mean, it's ongoing. We did put more hours into the store to satisfy the customer's needs.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "So as long as there's good demand, you expect to continue to pay your guys overtime, which is a high-priced problem to have?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right.", "Christopher M. Connor", "And not so much overtime. It just -- when we say putting hours in, we're ramping up. We're hiring more people and staffing these stores at a better level, Dmitry.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "A question on gross margin. We saw the volume posit that held forward [ph] in the first quarter. In terms of the gross margin recovery, I think you've talked about 43% to 46%. I'm just interested if that's still the range you're targeting and how you think the pace of recovery plays out back towards that as we move forward. Not necessarily talking about the second quarter, but over the, call it, medium term.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think that the long term, we still believe the 43% to 46% number is a good number, Eric. And in the meantime, in the short term, I think that -- or midterm, whatever you want to call it, we think that -- we talked about the first quarter really being the toughest when it comes to this raw material annualization. We think that we're probably going to start seeing some better comparisons to last year. Last year, we came in at 42.7% for the year. So on a quarter-by-quarter basis, I think you're going to see better comparisons, and I think you'll see the first one in the second quarter.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Great. And then secondly, on the SG&A and -- on the SG&A -- rate of SG&A growth, and I understand in 1Q, there were a few moving parts, but can you talk about a little bit about the discipline of how SG&A should grow relative to either sales dollar growth or volume growth? I know you talked a little a bit about that last quarter, but can you just sort of refine how we should be thinking about that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think that -- and this is where you get into -- we -- we're always looking to get improvement in the operational efficiencies. So we look at our gallons per full time equivalent. We also look at sales per full time equivalent. Some of those have been tougher to watch, Eric, because of the selling prices have gone over the last 2 to 3 years. You can imagine it was easier to get sales per full time equivalent increase than it was gallon per full time equivalent. So it's hard to give you a metric that I would tell you, \"Here's how you should build your models, and here's why.\" When you take a look at where we are, a lot of times on the plant side, we know pretty well where we're going to be in total capacity and where we are in capacity utilization because around the country, you might have stores that are in different spots of the utilization. So as those gallons grow in certain parts -- and you can imagine, we're very tight when it comes to the fourth quarter and first quarter on overtime and part-time hours. And when the demand came and there was demand everywhere, you saw SG&A and hours growing at -- in the Midwest division and Eastern division. So I think that probably the best venture I can tell you, if we have those kinds of gallon gains for the short period, you're going to see our SG&A grow in the 6% to 8% to 9%. When that starts coming down, then I think you'll see that go down.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Nils Wallin of CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "First off, I guess, is there a way either quantitatively or qualitatively to break out the type of demand you saw? How much of that you thought was pent-up demand? How much of it was the normal type of growth you would see from maintenance and property management?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. That's a good question, Nils. I don't know that we have much more data to offer you than kind of the historic growth of the industry. We long believe that architectural paint volumes move pretty much in lockstep with GDP growth. So to the extent that the market's growing -- the broader economic market is growing in a 1% to 2%, gallons should move at that pace. Sherwin has long believed that we can gain share in any cycle and that we would grow at 2x that. And then you put our kind of strong gallon performance for the quarter and figure out that some of that is rebound and pent-up demand and some of it is outperforming our competitors. Not quite sure that I can offer much more than that.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. It looks like you've built out more stores -- or extended more stores in the Southwestern division kind of year-over-year or at least 2011 versus 2010. And I'm wondering, is that a conscious decision because some of those areas were the most hurt during the downturn, so you figured those will be the ones that will rebound the quickest? Or is it lack of representation or share gains?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. We take the long-term view on the right markets to be putting our stores in. I think we've shared with the investment community a density map that shows that the western part of the United States is where our household penetration is at its lowest levels. Last year's numbers reflect a little bit more of a focus in California real estate development and strong store count adds in that market drove that number.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from Aram Rubinson of Nomura Securities.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Two things. One is would you mind giving us a little bit more color on that gross profit dollar that you gave us for the Paint Stores Group for the other divisions, if you don't mind?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. What's going to happen is -- and just give me a few seconds here. Stores group was $80 million and the incremental gross margin dollars, I think, was $60 million. And the Global Finishes Group, I think, it's right around $10 million. And then you have over in the Latin America group, $16 million -- oh, I'm sorry, I said that wrong. $3 million.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay, so $80 million, $60 million, $10 million and $3 million?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Two other quick ones, just to follow up. I appreciate that opening stores is a difficult task, both between situating them and also having human capital to open them professionally. There are companies like Dollar General that are opening 650 stores while you guys are opening 60. So in other words, it's probably possible to open more effectively. I'm wondering when you'll step on the gas and what you'd still need to see and what -- how high is up maybe on that metric for you?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, our hats off to Dollar General. 2 stores a day for a year, that's a hell of a pace. We've run as hard, Bob [ph], as 100 to 120 at our peak. And I think that we've commented in the last couple of years that with the significant downturn in the market, we've kind of considered ourselves at idle speed at this 50 to 60 store pace. Our expectations are that that number will begin to ramp up. We expect to do more this year than last year. And I think that we're going to continue to do more going forward.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then the final question, if you don't mind, is just a comment on the administrative segment. It looks like a very high number, $74 million. I think that was the -- maybe there was one other quarter that was that high in the past 10 quarters. What should we think in terms of modeling for that since it's a little bit less of kind of a straight line? How can we think about number for the year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think when you take a look at that $74 million, we were up $22 million, so we're up over 40%. Last year at around $243 million for the year. I don't think we're going to grow at 40%, but I could see that growing at 10% to 15% for the year.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Yes, Sean, just as a follow-up. I was looking at the others items in your P&L. The foreign currency gain was a nice swing in your favor. Was that cash, or is it just a function of booking assets held outside the U.S.?", "Christopher M. Connor", "It was the latter, Chuck, and it was really just an intercompany asset between us and Mexico with the Mexican changes there. So that's where -- you're right, the $5 million versus last year's $1.3 million. But there was the pounds from Great Britain and the Mexican peso with the assets on the balance sheet.", "Operator", "At this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Bob Wells for any closing remarks.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, Jackie.

Welcome to the second quarter conference call. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Lori Walker, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.", "Lori A. Walker", "Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2012, second quarter earnings conference call. Gary Hendrickson, our President and Chief Executive Officer, is with me on our call this morning.", "Before we begin, I'll direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning, which contains much of the information that we'll be covering in the call. This call is subject to the forward-looking statements language contained in our press release and our comments may include forward-looking statements as that term is defined by securities law. This morning, I\u2019ll begin by covering our results for the quarter, Gary will provide some context and then we\u2019ll respond to your questions.", "Second quarter sales totaled $1.03 billion, a 4% increase from the second quarter of 2011. Adjusted for currency and acquisitions, sales were up 3.4%. Adjusted net income per share for the quarter increased to $0.84, a 31% increase from $0.64 in 2011. Our press release includes details, showing the reconciliation of our reported to our adjusted results.", "As I comment on our gross margin and operating expense performance, note that restructuring is excluded in both years and acquisition related charges are excluded in the 2011 period.", "For the second quarter, our gross margin was 34.6%, up 230 basis points from 2011. Our margins benefitted from carryover pricing actions, which help to offset raw material cost increases. Margins also benefited from productivity improvements, our prior restructuring actions and strong incremental margins on new business. In the quarter we experienced raw material increases sequentially and year-over-year, and we expect mid single-digit increases in the back half of the year.", "As a rate to revenue, operating expenses were 21.5%, which were flat versus the second quarter of 2011. Quarter-over-quarter operating expense dollars increased $8.9 million or 4%. The reported tax rate for the second quarter was 31% down from a rate of 33% in the second quarter of last year. The lower rate was due to the geographical mix of earnings, and our full year tax rate guidance remains at 30% to 31%.", "Average diluted shares outstanding were $95.1 million, down $2.4 million from last year. In the quarter, we continue to return cash to shareholders, repurchasing 2 million shares for approximately $96 million and have 5 million shares remaining under our current authorization. We estimate average diluted shares outstanding for the third quarter to be approximately 95 million.", "Recapping our sales performance, our core growth was 3.4%, primarily driven by mid-single-digit price increases, which offset a 0.2% decline in volume. The currency impact was neutral and acquisitions added another 0.6% for total growth of 4% in the quarter. Let me provide some additional context on our sales, sequentially our volume trend improved from the first quarter to the second quarter, and we expect this trend to continue in the back half of the year.", "However, we did experience some headwinds in the quarter. Last year we made the decision to exit a small number of relatively high volume for unprofitable products and customers as part of our restructuring actions. Also in the quarter we saw a year-over-year inventory reduction in our North America home improvement channel. Absentee\u2019s impacts our volumes would have been positive.", "Looking at our segment results for the quarter, adjusted for currency and acquisitions, our Coatings segment sales increased 6%. Sales in this segment benefited from pricing a new business, which more than offset uneven market conditions and the exit of unprofitable product lines. Paint segment sales increased roughly 1%.", "Growth in China and pricing offset soft market conditions in Australia and last year\u2019s loss of the budding business. In North America, we had extremely strong sell through in our exterior and professional lines, up more than 30%. However, our overall North America paint sales were impacted by the inventory reduction in the home improvement channel as I just mentioned.", "Sales in our other segment increased roughly 1%. I\u2019m now going to move into a discussion of our EBIT margins for the quarter. All the numbers I\u2019ll be discussing again exclude restructuring charges and acquisition related charges in the 2011 period. Our Coating segment EBIT margin was 16.6%, up 420 basis points from 12.4% in the second quarter of 2011. The segment benefited from better price cost balance, productivity improvement, exit of unprofitable customers and products, and strong incremental margins on new business.", "Our paint segment EBIT margin was 12.5%, up 200 basis points from 10.5% in 2011. This improvement was driven by the benefits of prior restructuring, productivity gains and better price cost balance in Australia. The EBIT margin for our other segment was negative 12.4% compared with 1% in the second quarter last year. This is primarily due to the timing of incentive compensation expense. As a reminder other includes our corporate expenses. The total company EBIT margin for the quarter was 13% compared with 10.9% at the second quarter of 2011.", "Moving to the balance sheet, our net debt at the end of the quarter was $1.04 billion, an increase of $183 million from the end of last fiscal year. The increase was driven by share repurchases and the normal seasonality of cash flows.", "Our net debt capital was 46.2%. On May 1, we retired our maturing $200 million senior notes, using the combination of cash and commercial paper. We ended our quarter with $602 million of reserved liquidity. To the first six months of the year, we generated $2 million in operating cash flow, compared with the use of $59 million of the same period a year ago. The increase in cash flow was the result of higher earnings and improved working capital management. We estimate free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx and dividends to be a $180 million to $200 million in fiscal year 2012.", "Capital spending in the second quarter was $15.6 million up slightly from $15.3 million in the second quarter of 2011 and our capital spending forecast for the full year is $90 million. Depreciation and amortization for the quarter was approximately $23 million, roughly flat with last year. And our full year forecast for depreciation and amortization is approximately $90 million. As mentioned in our release, we are raising our fiscal year 2012 guidance to $320 million to $330 million, which excludes restructuring related charges.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn that call over to Gary for his comments.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Thank you, Lori. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on the call. We had a good quarter. Our 31% increase in earnings per share was a result of excellent execution on a number key initiative. First and most importantly for the long-term, we continued investing in our businesses which is resulting in further market share gains. And the incremental margins on this new business are very strong. This can be seen in the improved EBIT margins on our coating segment.", "In paints our China business had a good quarter, with much of the growth coming from products aimed at the affordable housing market, which is being supported by the Chinese government. In North America, we saw extremely strong sell through in our exterior and paint product lines. Overall, Paint segment growth was tempered somewhat by a weak residential housing market in Australia and a year-over-year inventory production in the North America home improvement channel. These challenges notwithstanding, we\u2019re pleased with the quarter in paints.", "Secondly, we managed our cost structure extremely well, both in terms of raw material cost and price, and in terms of productivity and expense management. We also saw the benefits of our 2011 restructuring actions including, as Lori mentioned, the planned exit of some high volume but unprofitable products and customers in our Coating segment. This combination of profitable growth and excellent cost management led to a year-over-year improvement in company\u2019s EBIT margin of 210 basis points.", "What we\u2019ve had to the rest of the year, we\u2019re expecting a trend of sequential volume improvement that we experienced this quarter to continue both in coatings and paints. The volume growth that we expect in Coating segment will be a combination of new business wins and gradually improving industrial markets in the U.S.", "In our Paint segment, we expect our China business will continue to grow through expanding distribution of both Warren and Valspar paint brands. In the U.S., our new Love Your Color Guarantee marketing campaign is showing early signs of success and we expect the North America paint market to be improved over the last year. And finally in Australia, our profitability improvement plan is on track.", "As Lori mentioned, we raised our full-year guidance to $3.20 to $3.30 per share from $2.92 to $3.12. The assumptions behind this increase or as I just outlined. Further volume growth combined with continued execution of our productivity and cost management initiatives.", "So with those comments, Lori and I were happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-answer session ", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. (Operator Instructions) And our first question goes to the line of PJ Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Prashant J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Yes, good morning.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Good morning, PJ.", "Lori A. Walker", "Good morning.", "Prashant J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Hey, Gary, if inventory drawdown was such a big deal in the quarter, I\u2019m just surprised that none of the other companies that have reported so far talked about it in fact they saw pull forward of demand, which drove their volume growth. So I was wondering if you could reconcile why your numbers are somewhat different than what other trend the other companies you\u2019re seeing so far.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Okay. Well, I think we saw a pull forward of demand too PJ in our exterior and professional product lines. As Lori mentioned, those product lines were up 30% year-over-year. Those are the product lines that are used mainly by professional contractors and so I think because of the warm weather, we saw more exterior painting happening in the year, and we saw more of that work being done by professionals. Let me come back to that point in a second and I\u2019ll sort of take you around the world in our Coating segment.", "Lori A. Walker", "Paint segment.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "In our Paint segment sorry. So in North America, our sales were up slightly if you exclude the inventory in fact that we talk about, our sales in North America would have been up mid to high-single-digits. In China our sales were up double digits, in Australia, our sales were down high single digits because as Lori mentioned of the funding loss last year and a weak residential market. As I said the exterior paints sold and professional lines sold really well up 30% but this is a relatively small portion of our mix, our mix is roughly 80% interior, 20% exterior. Our professional mix is roughly the same about is inverse to that, 20% professional to 25% professional and 75% [DIY]. So part of the explanation maybe that we saw a more professional work being done on the exterior homes because of the warm weather which is what you\u2019d expect. And our mix doesn\u2019t, isn\u2019t ideal for that", "Prashant J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for that.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You are welcome.", "Prashant J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "And just quickly on your Lowe\u2019s business, if you can talk about, you had said that maybe you lost a little bit of share last year, what\u2019s the strategy to get that back this year. And can you describe any new promotions that you maybe running at Lowe\u2019s? Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "This year our marketing is as I mentioned in my opening remarks, the Valspar love your color guarantee, which is a color assurance program that we are offering to consumers. So if a consumer comes in and buys paint at Lowe\u2019s our independent channel, takes it home and paints their wall and are unhappy with their color, they can go back to the retailer and buy up to two additional gallons. And hopefully get the color that they want and Valspar will rebate them for the second couple of gallons. This, so we're four weeks into it PJ and the initial results are really strong. For us it\u2019s both a strategy to bring consumers into our retailers, but it\u2019s also a strategy to sell consumers up to our best paint. So we should see as the year goes on, both incremental sales and incremental margin from this.", "Prashant J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Relative to market share gains and losses, I mean, I don\u2019t think that was if it happened it was on the margins and certainly not relevant to our overall results.", "Prashant J. Juvekar \u2013 Citigroup", "Great. Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next, we\u2019ll go to line of Ivan Marcuse from Keybanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Thanks for taking my questions. You are showing on, you continue to show nice sequential improvement in margins on the coatings business. So with raw material sort of, I guess, flattish here in resin side. Would you expect that the new products that 16, 15 margin to continue or would you expect that the sort of continue trending higher over the next several quarters.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, we\u2019ve done a lot of work in the Coating segment, Ivan, to get the margins to where they are, it\u2019s not only about price costs but it is about, it\u2019s about some of things that Lori mentioned earlier a fair amount of restructuring in our coatings product lines. There is a fair amount of new business in our coating products lines and those are, that new business is coming in at a very strong incremental margins. We exited some very low profit and unprofitable business, last year which is helping also, and then there is cost price, which is in many of the product lines and coatings we have almost right at this point. We still have a little bit of work to do and some of them we are experiencing inflation. But I think your point, it is about sustainability of those margins, and I think where we\u2019re running right now is healthy, we\u2019ll just have to see in the short-term how the raw material dynamics play out, if we see inflation in the back half of the year, they might decline a little bit, but if we see benign inflation then I think we are in pretty good shape.", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Great, and then there is a quick question probably for Lori, is what would you expect the, sort of (inaudible) I\u2019m might have missed it, your corporate line or the other how you reported what is your expectation for the full year.", "Lori A. Walker", "I would say, I\u2019ll answer the question in terms of the back half of the year, you would expect it to do be negative in the call at 8% to 10% range.", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay. So second half versus last year will be down 8%?", "Lori A. Walker", "No that would be what the loss would be. So I think last year it was roughly flat and then it was down pretty substantially in the fourth quarter.", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Right.", "Lori A. Walker", "So you would expect it to be hit. It will be a cost, roughly in that 8% to 10% range.", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. In your opening remarks did you say your volumes were down on a consolidated basis 2%? And if you did say that, did they shrink faster in coatings or in paints and what was the source of that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We did say that, Jeff, that number is correct.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "And your coatings was down more than paints, in fact paints was positive.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Positive, so what were some of the dynamics that pulled down the volumes in the coatings market.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "One, the largest one is the exit of last year, during our restructuring of a fair amount of unprofitable business, higher volume but unprofitable business in several of our product lines within coatings that amounted to low single digits, decreases in volume on a year-over-year basis. We also saw a little bit of weakness in our packing business this quarter, continuation of what we saw in the first quarter. The food markets in both Europe and particularly in the U.S. where we have a very high share in the food business are weak, beverage is still a little bit weak and in North America and in the quarter we saw the impact of a little bit of business that we lost last year in Europe, low margin sort of commodity business in packaging that we lost in a competitive bid. So those are drivers. It\u2019s the business that we exited. It\u2019s some weakness in packaging and it was one last piece of business with one customer in Europe.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay and thank you. And then lastly, Lori began by talking about favorable geographic distribution of revenues that influenced your tax rate. So did you, was it that you made less money in the United States and so that gave you a tax benefit or did you make more money in some particular low tax rate jurisdiction. Can you describe the geographic benefit and whether this geographic trend is part of your increase in guidance, that is it, I mean it looks like your tax rates might be a little bit better for the year.", "Lori A. Walker", "Actually Jeff to answer your question is more to the latter in terms of higher profitability and low tax jurisdiction. But that 30% to 31% guidance is actually been consistent, that\u2019s been our guidance for the whole year in terms of our cap rate, so there isn\u2019t really anything different. So that\u2019s not what\u2019s contributing to our increased guidance for the year.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "So where is the place that you are making more money where you have low tax rate?", "Lori A. Walker", "Pretty much there\u2019s a number of places outside the U.S. So in Europe there are places outside of the U.S. more business in China that\u2019s profitable and that those are the two primary areas.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Dmitry Silversteyn from Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Good morning and congratulations on another strong quarter. A couple of things, if I may. On the Australian business, can you talk about sort of what\u2019s going on there with, I understand the market overall is weak and that impacted your results in paints, I think you talked about being down high single-digits. But can you update us on as far as what the market penetration looks like whether there have been any new stores added or when they\u2019re going to be added if there is plan out there? And what\u2019s your progress is on restoring margins in that business?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "The last part of your question Dmitry as we\u2019re doing really well that against the plan that we put together in fact we\u2019re ahead of the plan on improving the profitability of the business, that\u2019s through the restructuring actions that we\u2019ve taken as through comprising that we put into the market. And it\u2019s through rationalization of the Wattyl store network. We have fewer stores today than when we started all of them profitable, so we exited some unprofitable stores last year. So, if you\u2019re talking about Wattyl stores, they\u2019re actually fewer today not more but if you\u2019re talking about master stores, which is the lowest JV then that\u2019s the really good story.", "I think as you know we want about 70% of the shelf space in the master stores with our Wattyl brands and they\u2019re rolling out on more or less the schedule that they advertised. I think there are 11 stores open today those stores are doing really well in terms of paint stores. I believe their plan is to have about 25 open at the end of the year, so that\u2019s a nice source of growth for us in that market notwithstanding a very weak growth residential housing market.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "If you were to sort of give us an idea at least in kind of a high level view of sales in your Australian paint between the company-owned stores and the master stores. I\u2019m assuming its predominantly still company-owned stores, but can you give us an idea that two thirds three quarters, 80%?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "At this point of time it\u2019s 90 plus percent in company-owned stores, Dmitry. So we have about 90 to 100, I don\u2019t know the exact number of how much company-owned stores. There are 11 Wattyl stores opened and our company-owned stores tend to do more business than we are doing in the Walmart stores today.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Got it.", "Lori A. Walker", "Master stores.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Master stores, sorry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Master, yes I understand that. Okay great, that\u2019s been very helpful, thank you. And then the second question on the Warren business you talked about that\u2019s being strong, up double-digits in China. And we\u2019ve heard obviously about the struggle with Chinese economy as far the GDP and the government trying to manage the soft landing. Is the growth that you\u2019re seeing there due to the store openings in the tier two, tier three cities is that more people governments as you mentioned continue to spend on kind of an affordable housing program? What\u2019s behind the strong results in China?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "It\u2019s a combination of a couple of things. One if we do have more stores today than we did at the start of the year, I think we\u2019ve got 2,700 stores open today versus this 2,500 six months ago. So that\u2019s we continue to penetrate in the tier two and tier three cities. And I did mention that we have a new Warren product that we are putting both through the war and distribution, which is inclusive distribution to Valspar and our distributors are putting it through nonexclusive distribution. And this is a product that\u2019s an affordable product targeted towards the low to low income housing and that the government is supporting. And so we had a little bit of an inventory built in the quarter as our distributors purchased that from us. But the good news is that the product is selling through and our distributors are reordering. So we\u2019re pretty optimistic that we did the right thing there. You might recall that what we\u2019ve been talking about this for a couple of quarters that our focus was on the affordable housing market because that\u2019s the segment that\u2019s being supported by the China government. This product is an outcome of the strategy that we\u2019ve developed to participate in that.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "So if you look at the Warren sales as well as the product that you are selling through nonexclusive distributors and the Valspar brand to the extend that you\u2019re pushing that into tier one cities? What\u2019s your total Chinese sales these days?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "In dollars?", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "In dollars, yeah. Well, in local currency, it\u2019s about the same (inaudible).", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "With that business might be, Warren in total might be $400 million this year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay so it is\u2026", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "That\u2019s more or less the target.", "Dmitry Silversteyn \u2013 Longbow Research", "Okay. Okay great, thanks very much. That\u2019s all the questions I had.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You\u2019re welcome", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Bob Koort from Goldman. Please go ahead.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Good mornings.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Hey, Bob.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Gary, could you comment a little bit on what you\u2019re seeing through the home centers, I know you\u2019ve made the comments about the exterior side was pretty stronger reflective of whether I think the big box you don\u2019t sell to talked about a little bit of deceleration in April. So what does the sequentials look like for you through the quarter end and what you\u2019ve seen so far in May?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Very positive, our comps have been positive.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "But sort of they stayed decelerated or accelerated stayed sort of the same growth rate?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "It\u2019s been a funny season, exterior comps as I talked about, and POS has been fantastic we sell through about like 30% across both of the main channels that we sell in. But I wouldn\u2019t say that they\u2019ve accelerated except in last four months or last four weeks, where we\u2019ve seen very strong sales of our top products in that channel. I think that might be because of the marketing that we\u2019re doing, but I don\u2019t see the comps of the other paint companies, so I can\u2019t say whether the whole market is performing that way or whether it\u2019s just goes for", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "All right. And is there any raise of hope out there in the wood coatings market and would we view that as a leading indicator of things getting better or is it just continue to be under severe pressure?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Bob this is the first quarter in a long time that I can say our wood business performed really well. So I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a leading indictor or not, but on a year-over-year basis volumes where pretty much flat. The wood business was one of the businesses where we did exit some profitable customers and products last year. And as I said volume was basically flat and sales were up high single-digits. So and I would say that, the folks in that business are more optimistic today than they have been in a long time.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Outside of exiting some wood business, can you describe if you would what other kind of business lines you got out of or are uncomfortable doing that, can you describe what it was about those businesses that made them lower margin? Was it is an issue with your own cost structure? Was it an issue with the end market? And what sort of what\u2019s driving some of these lower margins in the business as you exited?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, they were unprofitable for us. I don\u2019t know that they were necessarily our cost structure but the end markets that we were selling into were pretty challenged. And when you\u2019re selling the customers that are not making money, you\u2019re typically not going to have very good margins. So I\u2019ll tell you what they were and we\u2019re happy to talk about it. We were in the mirror coatings business and we use to sell a product which is pretty high volume product called a silver solution, which is part of the process that mere manufacturers use that contains silver and we were doing a pass through on the silvering solution, sometimes we\u2019ve got it right, sometimes we didn\u2019t more times than not we got it wrong and we were losing money on it. So we got out of that business, some of the wood products that that the wood products industry in North American in particular is pretty challenging from profitability standpoint, so we exited some there. We exited some Wattyl business that industrial business that Wattyl had in Australia that was losing money and we exited some, some of our businesses in China that we\u2019re losing money as well. I say businesses, I actually mean products and customers not businesses per se.", "So it was kind of across the board, when we were going through our restructuring last year, we look at all aspect of the business and make some decisions about customers and products that where we didn\u2019t think we could ever be competitive at least not in the short to medium terms, so we left them.", "Robert Koort \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Gary.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Saul Ludwig from Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for that explanation on where you\u2019ve exited some business. You\u2019ve now had a four consecutive quarters of negative volume. Are you at the point where and I think that\u2019s one of the things that maybe differentiating you from your competitors somewhat volume trends. Are you now at the point where you\u2019ve annsiversied some of these business that you exited? And how should we think about total corporate volume on a year-over-year basis in other words you were down 2%, this quarter you were down I think 6% or 7% in the first quarter now you\u2019re going to be comparing against quarters that were down in the third and fourth quarters a year ago. How should we think about volume going forward on a year-over-year basis that\u2019s one of the things that are kind of important in are impacting the way your stock is being good.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yeah, you\u2019re right and the first part of your question was, when do we anniversary some of the decisions that we made last year, and that will happen not in the third quarter, but in the fourth quarter of the year. But we and you are also right saw that last year we had a very strong first half of last year and a relatively weak second half of last year. So as we move through the year, our comps get easier in the second half of the year, and we think our volumes will be up.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Do you think even in the third quarter you will have up volume.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Sequentially it will be higher than it was, and we should close that gap in the third quarter, that what we are planning for.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay, so you are still might be down on a year-over-year basis a little bit?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I would be disappointed if we are. We are planning to be up.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "All right, both in third and especially the fourth.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Right.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay. And then Lori, earlier you said that the other expenses would be $8 million to $10 million in the second half of the year. Was that $8 million to $10 million at each quarter or $8 million to $10 million in the second half?", "Lori A. Walker", "No I said negative 8% to 10%. So that\u2019s going to run what somewhere in that call it $7 million to $9 million something like that.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Each quarter?", "Lori A. Walker", "Correct.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Gotcha. And Gary in the packaging business, how much where their volumes down, and when do you anniversary that loss of business that you lost in a competitive bid.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "They were down, they were up, let me just take this all for a second, they were up in China or Asia generally they were up in Latin America. They were down mid single digits in North America and a little bit more than that Europe, and we anniversary that in the fourth quarter.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Okay, great. Thank you, very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we will go to line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP", "Yes, thank you. Gary question on paints, some of your competitors pointed to better interior volumes is the sign that you know the demand we have seen year-to-date is more than just, weather pull forward. So, ask your inventory decline, where your interior volumes up in the quarter?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Let me see, they where, but I don\u2019t know the exact number Don. As I said for the last sort of thing, but close attention in the last four weeks or so since we\u2019ve started our marketing campaign, and they have been the sell through has been very good in the last four weeks.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP", "So, it\u2019s your sense that the paint market is recovering here or it\u2019s just been largely this exterior pull forward because of weather.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Right, if I had to hazard an opinion, I would say that the paint market this year will be stronger than it was last year.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP", "Okay, and what was it exactly that drove the inventory drawdown was just your customer wanting to have lower inventories? Or what gives you confidence, that this was a one time event.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, no they\u2019ve got a stated policy of driving inventory productivity throughout the store, not only in the paint department and this was just an outcome of their productivity initiatives.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP", "Okay. And then switching to coatings, can you talk a bit about what kind of demand growth you saw on ag and construction equipment, and the general industrial coatings. And then also talk a bit about your new initiatives in pipeline and seaborne containers, how much volumes were up there.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yeah, I don\u2019t know the exact number for ag and construction, because where we are taking market share, the business was up, I don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t tell you, now we have to get back to you on whether that was the result of share gains that we made or market growth. I suspect that the market was up again in the quarter and we took some share. Containers going well, we\u2019ve converted four plants now, and we have a couple of others that are in the process of evaluating the new technology and so I would call that on track. The container market is very weak, I mean, there aren\u2019t a lot of containers being made right now which aren\u2019t, the negative is that we\u2019re not selling as much as we would have otherwise if their market were strong the positive is it giving container manufacturers more time to evaluate and qualify our coatings.", "And pipelines going great, in fact in the quarter we want some new business in Europe and want some new business in the U.S. and for the first time we want some business in Mexico. So those were really across the company, the high points of the quarter was the gains in the businesses that we just talked about as well as some market share gains in our coil business.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP", "Okay. And then final question, just a clarification on the Chinese market, is the overall market up as well or is it just that lower priced market that you\u2019ve been focusing some of your attention on?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yeah, I think the overall market, I\u2019m not talking about our business, but I think the overall market is pretty much flat.", "Don Carson \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group, LLP", "All right, okay. Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to line of Steve Schwartz from First Analysis. Please go ahead.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "Good morning, everyone.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Good morning.", "Lori A. Walker", "Hi, Steve.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "Your year-over-year improvement in the Paint segment, operating margin or EBIT margin, is the biggest we\u2019ve seen now for sometime. And so it\u2019s certainly on a very nice trend. Can you parse out what the driver behind that 200 basis point improvements was it simply price cost and of course I\u2019m sure there is a domestic (Inaudible) Chinese factor in there?", "Lori A. Walker", "Steve, as I mentioned in my initial comments that improvement was due to restructuring actions along with productivity improvements and then better price cost balance in our Australian business.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp", "In that order, then, in terms of, is that contribution to the improvement?", "Lori A. Walker", "Yeah, probably is in that order.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp", "Okay. And from the price increase standpoint, I did see something publicly around your general industrial business, we know you\u2019ve done things elsewhere, when do your last pricing efforts start to anniversary in coatings and in paints, if you could give us an idea of how those have carry through to this point?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We are still as you said in some parts of our coatings business; we\u2019re out with pricing today because of the inflation that we saw in the quarter and the inflation that we expect to see in the next couple of quarters. And in paints, we are still out with pricing in couple of our markets, where out with pricing in Australia and in we\u2019re changing our mix a little bit, which is sort of like pricing and in our business in China. And as we said pretty publicly we need more pricing in our North America channel to back to the margin rate that we had previously.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp", "Okay, so Gary, would you say that with what you\u2019ve already announced, put out to customers and so forth, are you at the peak of this wave yet of capturing that pricing, is that behind you in the second quarter or is it still ahead of you here in the third or fourth?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "It just depends on we're playing catch up in one channel in paints. We\u2019re in pretty good shape and many of our product lines and coatings, but in some of those coatings product lines we need more pricing.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp", "Okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "That\u2019s probably all I can say.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp", "Okay. And then, Lori just one simple question, regarding interest expense with the made debt retirement, is there any significant change in your interest expense going forward?", "Lori A. Walker", "No, that\u2019s we are coming on that before we, the forecast for the year would be $68 million to $69 million for interest expense. And it will be pretty evenly split in the third and the fourth quarter.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis Corp", "Okay. That\u2019s great. Thanks for further questions.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we'll go to the line of David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you, good morning. This is actually Rob (inaudible) in for David. Not to belabor this price versus raw materials point, but in the quarter could you just elaborate on a consolidated basis what the price versus raw GAAP was? On the dollar basis", "Lori A. Walker", "Well, typically what we\u2019ve said is, you know, at the end of last quarter we were talking about roughly 85%, 90% recovered. And I would say we made a little bit more progress on that in the second quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Understood, and then as far as your outlook for mid to high single-digits raw material inflation is that mostly driven by TiO2 or by propylene resins, because I know we had a pretty big settlement downwards in propylene this month.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yeah, it's both of them, it was, I mean, it settled down relative to market expectations, but it\u2019s still up versus last year. So it owes to propylene and its impact on the derivative products and the TiO2 suppliers are still out looking for pricing. So, we've kind of got that both into our forecast.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Understood. Thank you, very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Nils Wallin from CLSA, please go ahead.", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You are welcome.", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "Last year you had may be $6 million or so restructuring charges aftertax may be $8 million before tax. And your year-on-year improvement in EBIT was in the $28 million to $30 million range. So would you say that all of that restructuring charge was in actually reflected in the year-on-year improvement in your operating profit? And then, with this quarter taking something like a $4 million charge would we see a similar improvement in next year?", "Lori A. Walker", "Well, Nils just to clarify, we had talked when we had initiated our 2011 restructuring actions that we would incur somewhere around 35 tons of costs, which we still have a little bit more of that incur here in the third quarter. And now we would have roughly something like $0.12 to $0.14 in terms of annualized improvements. So, to answer your question we are seen that come through our results, and I did dealt into our year-end guidance, the benefits from the restructuring, some of that well about start to anniversary here in the upcoming quarters.", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "Thanks. Then your weakness in Europe packaging, one kind of thinks is that business is being relatively stable and certainly a little cyclical and insulated. So, was there a something in between who you supply to and who your customer supply to that led to inventory drawdown there as well or why would it have such weakness?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "No I don\u2019t think there is any, any exogenous event and we\u2019ve had a fairly weak food can market in North America and Europe now for a while, last year it was weak, this year is shaping up to be weak. Although we won\u2019t know about the food can market until later in the year, when crops are harvested and packed but in North America beverage canned shipments were down about 5% last year.", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "Got it", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "That is function of a number of retail factors that aren\u2019t certainly not something our customers or we can control.", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "Okay. And then just a final question on pipeline coatings, the growth there is simply a factor because of greater steel demand so obviously that\u2019s pulling your coil coatings up or is there something there in terms of new technology that\u2019s allowing on top of the actual volume growth that\u2019s allowing you to grow that business? And then if that is new technology are you going to have greater CapEx going forward to supply that business?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "The last part of the question is yes, we are investing in our plants to supply that business, but it is a modest investment, very modest investment and it\u2019s captured within our full year CapEx budget of $90 million, but we\u2019re taking market share in that business I mean that\u2019s just that simple. The overall industry is growing because infrastructure transmission of energy and water it is more or less a megatrend, but we\u2019re relatively new entrant and that we\u2019ve really only been selling into that market for a couple of years and so everything that we do right now we consider market share gains.", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "Thanks very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of Rosemarie Morbelli from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Thank you for taking my question. Most of them obviously have been answered, but I was wondering at the end of the first quarter, you were a pretty cautious in terms of your outlook. So could you give us a better feel as to what, surprised you the most during the quarter in terms of what you are expecting and what actually happened?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We don\u2019t have any big surprises Rosemarie, to be honest, the quarter pretty much unfolded the way, we would have expected I mean we expected the one thing I would say that we expected a bit more inflation, raw material inflation that we had in the quarter. Our point view is that that inflation has been pushed out, not eliminated. So that\u2019s still a risk in the back half of the year, but we didn\u2019t see as much in the quarter as we expected.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "So, you have been getting some tier two price increase, whether they are in yet, are they are coming. This is going to affect your gross margin. And you usually have a six to nine months type of a lag before you can catch up with it. Should we look at that as the continuing trend or have you changed the way you are operating and you think you can catch up with it faster than you did in the past?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I think you can count on that as continuing model for us.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And could you update us on the reformulation, what is happening in terms of switching to a lower grade Chinese tier two or the ways of diminishing your, how much you get in?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yeah, our technical people have done a very nice job of minimizing our usage to the TiO2 we\u2019ve certainly eliminated the amount that we require to supply the products that we supply to various markets. And we are using a lot of Chinese TiO2. I don\u2019t want to give you percentages on either of these things but we\u2019re very pleased with the work that\u2019s being done and we\u2019re very pleased with both the quality and the security supply of what\u2019s just coming out of China today quality has improved a lot in a last couple of years and we\u2019ve been able to use that product in a lot more applications and we would have expected say two years ago or so when we started seeing the big increases in TiO2 pricing.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "So the Chinese is not quite as white or is it a question of opacity, how do you determine where it can be used on that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "That\u2019s a complicated question. How about if we, if you want to answer, the good answer to that question we should put you in touch with someone who can help you with that.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay\u2026", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I\u2019m not a chemist.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Neither am I, but I was looking for kind of the run-of-the-mill type of\u2026", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Let just say it\u2019s different, it\u2019s different in color, so there is some applications which are very color sensitive that it can\u2019t be used for because standards have been established for those colors.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "And those standards might need to change, but it is the product coming out of China today is very good, much improved over a couple of years ago.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "All right, that\u2019s good to hear. And in your projection for the year, what kind of weakness that you anticipate in Europe, I mean, you are looking at more widely spread type of recession, are you still only looking at Southern Europe having issues and using that front for example is not going to file a suite.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Europe is in recession. And for us it shouldn\u2019t have the impact on us that it might have other industrial companies, because our business is mainly packaging and coatings in Europe. We have a small industrial business in Europe that\u2019s doing well, by the way, in fact that\u2019s one of ones that Lori mentioned earlier as more profitable this year than in the past it\u2019s doing well. But it is a small part of the overall business. And can coatings, while, what we did have some volume challenges in the fruit can market that this quarter the overall market is pretty good. So, I answer the question in specific to Valspar, not more generally, because that\u2019s what I\u2019m more comfortable to talk about.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "No. I understand. However, the European will stop drinking sodas, for example, canned sodas in a recessionary environment. Are you seeing any of that yet, are you expecting to see no more of a decline in that category. If you look at what has happened in the region during the last recession?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I think the best answer to that is to refer you to what our customers are saying about beverage can demand in Europe. And our customers are saying that beverage canned demand in Europe this year will up mid-single digits.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Up, you said.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes up.", "Rosemarie Morbelli \u2013 Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You are welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we\u2019ll go to the line of John Mcnulty from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Yeah good morning, just a few questions. On the destocking that you saw in the, at our home center level or the DIY level, I guess, I\u2019m a little bit surprised by just given the potential for recovery in the housing market, in a decent weather and I guess I\u2019m curious, have you ever seen destocking from this kind of this chain going into the paint season as opposed to normally coming out?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "As I said John, they\u2019ve been working hard on inventory productivity and that was the reason for. It was mostly on interior products, not exterior products. So I think the key question is, are you missing sales and the answer I would say is no, because we did have a very strong exterior and professional quarter. And so those products were fully supplied is productivity that\u2019s all I can say.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And do you see any risk at least to the potential restocking phase, where again the markets may be recovering better than maybe your customer appreciates and you see a restocking phase or is that not likely?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Don\u2019t know.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay fair enough. And then on the affordable housing related business that you are developing in China, can you talk to us about the margin potential there and if its somewhat similar to the rest of your China platform if its lower, may be because its discounted product are higher because of the potential volume, how should we think about that going forward?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "It\u2019s pretty similar John. The gross margin is roughly the same, may be a little bit lower but the expenses were also lower, because we\u2019re not supporting that to the extent that we do Warren and Valspar and it\u2019s an nonexclusive product, it\u2019s the advertising for it is lower and it\u2019s more and more by distributors and by us.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, fair enough. And then just the last question on the Love Your Color Guarantee program, just so I have an understanding of how that works, if a customer does come back for their two new gallons, who takes on the cost of that is it you, is it split between you and your customer, how should we think about that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We do, we take down that cost.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, great. Thanks for the color.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And now we\u2019ll go to the line of Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks. Can you remind me what the acquisition benefit was in the quarter on a percentage basis?", "Lori A. Walker", "Yeah, that was that Brazilian powder coatings business.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Right", "Lori A. Walker", "And so that anniversary this quarter.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Was there a net benefit or did it assist yourselves and by what percentage are contract yourselves and by what percentage?", "Lori A. Walker", "Yeah, it helped ourselves by 0.6 tenths of a percent.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Six tenths of a percent. And in the beginning I think you said that you are growth ex-currency in the acquisition was 3.4%, so if volumes were down too. Does that mean price was up roughly 5.4 in the quarter overall?", "Lori A. Walker", "Yeah, that\u2019s definitely right.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, was there any sequential price improvement?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Quarter-over-quarter, I mean", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Yeah, from the previous quarter did your average price has raised or fall?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I think they stayed, they were about the same.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas \u2013 JPMorgan ", "They stayed about the same. Okay thank you very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time we have no further questions, please continue.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Okay, well thanks everyone for joining the call today. As I said we\u2019re pleased with our quarter thus far employees are executing well on our initiatives around growth and productivity and as we look ahead we expect to continue to grow our volumes and we\u2019re confident in our guidance of $3.20 to $3.30 per share.

Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is with me on our call this morning.", "Before we begin, I'll direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning that contains much of the information that we'll be covering in the call. This call is subject to forward-looking statements language contained in our press release and our comments may include forward-looking statements as that term is defined by securities law.

For the third quarter, our gross margin was 34.2%, up 280 basis points from 2011. ", "Let me offer some context on how we achieved this improvement. First, we delivered a significant amount of new business in the quarter which is coming in at a higher average margin rate. All of our significant product lines in our coatings segment had new business wins in the quarter. This new business helped to offset soft market conditions and our decision in last year to exit a small number of high volume but unprofitable product lines.", "Next, our internal initiatives around productivity as well as prior restructuring actions continued to deliver significant savings. And finally, we continued to see the benefit from previous pricing actions that we put in place to offset raw material inflation. Once again in the quarter Valspar employees did an excellent job of executing against our growth and our productivity initiatives.", "Looking at raw materials, we experienced sequential low single digit increases in the quarter and for the full year, we expect raw material inflation to be in the mid-single digit range. ", "Operating expenses as a rate to revenue were 20.3%, up slightly from 19.8% in the third quarter of 2011 primarily related to the timing of incentive compensation accrual. The reported tax rate for the quarter was 32%, up from a rate of 29% in the third quarter of last year. The lower rate in 2011 was due to adjustments related to prior year. Our full year tax rate guidance remains unchanged at 30% to 31%. And as a reminder, our tax rate in the fourth quarter last year included a $0.09 per share benefit for non-recurring items. ", "Average diluted shares outstanding were 93.6 million, down 2.3 million from last year. In the quarter, we continued to return cash to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 1.2 million shares for $57.6 million and have 3.8 million shares remaining under our current authorization. We estimate average diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter to be approximately 93.5 million.", "Recapping our sales performance, adjusted for currency net sales increased 3.3% in the quarter. Currency impact was negative 2.6% resulting in reported sales growth of about 1%. Acquisitions did not have any impact on the quarter.", "Looking at our segment results for the quarter, adjusted for currency, our coatings segment sales increased 5.2%. Sales in this segment benefited from new business and prior pricing actions that offset uneven market conditions and last year\u2019s exit of unprofitable product lines. The impact on coatings segment sales from this exited product line is in the low single digits.", "Paint segment sales when adjusted for currency increased just under 2%. In our North America consumer product line, sales were up more than 10% driven by strong consumer response to our market initiatives and timing of seasonal inventory builds in the North American home improvement channel. ", "In China, we saw continued volume growth from our initiatives aimed at the affordable housing market. However these volume improvements were partially offset by softness in our business in Australia, due in part to a continued weak residential housing market and last year\u2019s loss of the Bunnings business. ", "Sales in our other segment when adjusted for currency declined roughly 2%. I\u2019m now going to move into a discussion of our EBIT margins for the quarter and all of the numbers I\u2019ll be discussing exclude restructuring charges. So our coatings segment EBIT margin was 17.2%, up 360 basis points from 13.6% in the third quarter of 2011. The segment benefited from new business with higher than average margins, productivity improvements, the planned exit of unprofitable product lines and better price cost balance. ", "Our paint segment EBIT margin was 11.9%, up 110 basis points from 10.8% in 2011. This improvement was primarily driven by productivity gains and the restructuring benefits in our Australian business. The EBIT margin for our other segment was negative 0.5% compared with positive 0.9% in the second quarter last year. As a reminder other includes our corporate expenses. The total company EBIT margin for the quarter was 13.9%., up 230 basis points versus 11.6% in the third quarter of 2011.", "Moving to the balance sheet, our net debt at the end of the third quarter was $972 million, an increase of $113 million from the end of last fiscal year. The increase was primarily driven by share repurchases. Our net debt to capital was 44.8%. Through the first nine months of the year, we generated $166 million in operating cash flow, compared with $106 million through the same period a year ago. The increase in cash flow was the result of higher earnings and improved working capital management. We estimate free cash flow which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx and dividends to be $180 million to $200 million in fiscal year 2012.", "Capital spending in the third quarter was $31.3 million, up from $15 million in the third quarter of 2011. In the quarter, we invested in the expansion of our India operation to support our growth in that fast growing industrial market. Our capital spending forecast for the full year is $90 million. ", "Year to date depreciation and amortization was approximately $68.6 million, roughly equivalent to last year. And our full year forecast for depreciation and amortization is approximately $90 million. As mentioned in our release, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2012 guidance of $3.20 to $3.30, which excludes restructuring related charges.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Gary for his comments.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Thank you, Lori and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. We were pleased with our performance in the quarter against the backdrop of a very challenging market conditions. A 21% improvement in earnings per share is a great result.", "Let me provide a little bit of color on the market demand as we see it. Our North America business performed well in the quarter with mid-single digit volume increases. But as the quarter progressed the market began to soften somewhat. ", "Our businesses in Europe and China were soft throughout the quarter. In Europe, volumes were down mid-single digits. And in China, our volumes were down slightly versus 2011 in a real estate and construction market that is down more than 10% in the same period of time. So it\u2019s a challenging environment but we performed very well, and we did have some notable bright spots that I would like to highlight.", "First, our Latin America team did an exceptional job in the quarter. All of our product lines in that region performed very well with volume growth in the mid-teens and revenue growth in local currency in the mid-20s. In our paint segment, in North America the Love Your Color Guarantee is delivering on our expectations. Our mix has improved and our paint sales in the U.S. and home improvement channel have been positive. ", "In Australia and New Zealand, our Wattyl profit improvement plan is ahead of schedule and we were recently awarded new business at a large customer in the independent hardware channel. And our consumer business in China continues to do well in difficult market with our initiatives around the affordable housing market. ", "In our coatings segment, we had some notable market share gains in packaging coatings, industrial coatings and in wood coatings which helped to offset soft markets. As we said previously, many of these business wins are a result of differentiated and innovative products that carry higher margins. ", "We also continue our laser focus on operational discipline. Our improved margins in both coatings and paint are benefitting from productivity initiatives and prior restructuring actions. Price cost is more in balance this now than it was at this time last year, and while we did see some raw material inflation in the quarter, we expect the trend line to flatten. ", "So looking forward at the macro business environment, our outlook is somewhat cautious given the challenges of the weak global economy and sluggish growth in the United States. We\u2019re anticipating a challenging fourth quarter as customers adjust the uneven demand and uncertainty about economic stability in eurozone, slowing growth in China and uneven recovery in the U.S. ", "All of that said, we\u2019re confident in the fundamentals of our business and in our employees to take the actions necessary to respond to changing market conditions. Our diverse business mix, our demonstrated ability to win new business as well as successful execution of productivity initiatives will continue to serve us well and we are reaffirming our adjusted full year earnings per share guidance of $3.20 to $3.30. ", "So with those comments, Lori and I are happy to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from the line of Saul Ludwig with Northcoast Research.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Hey Gary, two questions, not so much focus on the third quarter but at the beginning of the year I think one of your main \u2013 two main goals was to, for each of your businesses to gain market share, and two, to continue the introduction of new products that you had been so successful with for the past two or three years. And I am just wondering if you could address your performance versus those goals and as you talk about market share, one of the things that I am sure is on a lot of people's minds is when you look at your volume compared to the volumes reported by many other coatings companies, it would not appear as if there was any market share gains. But I wonder if you could address both the market share question and the new product question. ", "Gary Hendrickson", "Sure. You are right, Saul. Those were the goals. I will answer the second question first. I can tell you that we are taking market share. In our coatings segment that effect is being somewhat masked by the fact that we exited some unprofitable product lines during our restructuring last year. That amounted to about 4% of the volumes in our coatings segment. So I think that maybe part of the reason that you have a perception that, or others may have a perception that we\u2019re not taking as much market share as we have. We set a goal in the beginning of the year for each of our businesses to win new business and we do have innovation goals. ", "As I mentioned in my opening remarks in our coatings segment this quarter, all of our businesses in our coatings segment achieved market share gains. Packaging had an excellent quarter, including with innovative -- very innovative technology and as you being someone who\u2019s covered the company for a long time knows that innovation and packaging these days is non-BPA. And we had some significant wins in the quarter with non-BPA technology in that business. Our pipe coatings business which we consider -- since it\u2019s a new business we consider anything that we achieve. In that business market share gains had another good quarter. ", "Our container business in China, which is possibly the most innovative technology that we\u2019ve developed in the company in recent years, converting an entire industry potentially from solvent based to water-based, signed letters of intent with two additional manufacturers of containers in the quarter. We\u2019ve now converted four lines, and we have two in process. Our wood coatings business had three significant customers that converted their business to us in the quarter. So that\u2019s a lot of words. You know our key metric is net new business and our net new business metric for the year is in the mid-single digits, which is exactly what we had in our plan.", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "Thank you, Gary.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You\u2019re welcome. Saul, is this \u2013 Tyler tells me this may be your last call?", "Saul Ludwig \u2013 Northcoast Research", "I think it might be. ", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, we\u2019d all like to say thank you. It\u2019s been a pleasure working with you. Thank you for your fair and balanced coverage of the company over the years and we wish you well as you transition into your new roles. ", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Steve Schwartz with First Analysis.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "I get a question for you on the paint business in North America. I think in the past you've called out that that business is maybe 80% DIY and I am wondering of the 20% that\u2019s non-DIY do you have a sense for how much of that goes into like new construction or is it just maintenance type paints with contractors and what have you?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I would say of that 20% Steve, probably none of it goes into new construction. It would all be going to professional painters like property remodelers, property maintenance \u2013 remodelers, repair modelling, contractors, property maintenance, people like that, not the painters that are doing new construction. ", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "And then just as follow-up, can you give us an idea on where the volume fell in coatings for the quarter on a year-over-year basis?", "Gary Hendrickson", "On a year-over-year basis volume in coatings was down very slightly.", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "So like low single digits. ", "Gary Hendrickson", "Very low single digits. ", "Steven Schwartz \u2013 First Analysis", "Okay and at this point you're starting to lap the pruning that you had done, right?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We will and if that\u2019s right. Some of that \u2013 some of it will lap in the fourth quarter, not all of it but some of it will.", "Operator", "And you do have a question from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.", "Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank", "Hi good morning. This is actually Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. Just a quick question on gross margins, propylene has come down heavily since Q2 highs and TiO2 seems to be flattening out here. How should we think about gross margins going into the back half of calendar \u201912?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, you are talking about price and cost, I think Ram and yeah I think price and cost in our coatings businesses is pretty well-balanced. Price cost in our paint segment is that we still have a little bit of work to do. It\u2019s not totally \u2013 we haven\u2019t totally recovered all of the inflation that we've experienced over the past year or so. But it's getting a lot closer to being balance.", "Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank", "And then just on your efforts to reduce TiO2 usage, could you elaborate there a little bit?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Our technical people have done a fantastic job both in terms of substituting Chinese sulfate grade TiO2 in our products in the U.S. and Europe, as well as actual elimination of TiO2 from our products. So mid-single-digit elimination and then in the 20s in terms of substitution. ", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs", "Hey good morning. This is actually Brian Maguire on for Bob. Just a question on the North American paint you had a nice rebound in sales after some inventory issues at Lowe's in the second quarter. But you indicated maybe that as the quarter went on it started to weaken a little bit and maybe into the fourth quarter with a little bit weak. How much of that do you think had to do with inventory issues in the channel and maybe there were some deferral of inventory building into the third quarter that was maybe one-time blip and now it\u2019s coming back down, or how much of it do you think was actually changes in end market demand through the year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Those are a lot of questions Brian. Let me try to \u2013 I will answer it in context. So you're right. Your recollection is correct. In the second quarter we -- inventories were not built at the same time as they were in 2011. Our main customer in the home-improvement channel did build inventory, seasonal inventories in our third quarter. So one way to think about how the performance there is average those two together. And if you do that our revenue was up mid-single digits in those two quarters together and our volumes were up in the low single digits in those two quarters together. ", "Our paint sales are positive. In that channel our paint sales are positive in North America. When I made my comment \u2013 in my prepared comments about the market softening a bit during the quarter, I wasn\u2019t necessarily being specific to paint. I was talking about our entire North America business. Our paint sales have actually held pretty steady and POS in both of our main channels has been positive through the quarter.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs", "And some of your peers have been talking recently about some of their Titanium dioxide prices actually falling in maybe some select grades and geographies. But it sounds like there is also some chatter about that now becoming more universal. Are you seeing that in your negotiations with folks and when you are talking price, are you seeing that out there that we are starting to actually see some drop in Titanium dioxide pricing?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I\u2019d rather not comment specifically, that\u2019s getting pretty granular on one raw material that we have. I will say that the nomination at the TiO2 suppliers put forward for July did not stick in any geography. And I will say that in geographies outside of the U.S. we have seen some deals where we have been able to reduce our costs at least temporarily.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs", "I think the all-time peak gross margin for the company was around 34.7 and even averaging from little bit north of 34 recently, maybe with some of the pruning you have done on unprofitable businesses you\u2019re getting a little bit of a benefit from that and then maybe offset by some of the acquisitions you have done in some lower margin businesses since then. But do to think that, that 34.7 from \u201809 is a high watermark that is achievable to hit again or is it one that you're thinking that you can actually exceed at some point?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I\u2019d rather not talk about gross margin per se. We\u2019ve got a cost structure that includes a lot more than gross margin. We think a lot more about our operating margin and that -- and our operating margin and our gross margin are benefitting from a lot of things that we\u2019ve done. You mentioned the restructuring, we\u2019re seeing the full benefit from that now. You also mentioned the pruning of unprofitable business that, that\u2019s helped. But we've also \u2013 our employees also have been driving a huge amount productivity in the company. And then lastly new business. You talked a little bit about our new business wins and how that\u2019s flowing through our P&L as an incremental margin. About 100 basis points of our improvement in our coatings segment is a direct result of the new business wins that we have achieved in the last six months or so. So there are lot of factors, not just the ones that are sort of the headlines.", "Operator", "We do have a question from the line of John Mcnulty with Credit Suisse.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Just a couple of questions. On the paint segment, what kind of pricing did you see in the quarter roughly?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Across the whole segment low single digits. ", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "So it sounds like you had positive volumes in kind of the DIY market in the paint segment. I think if I remember correctly, you said China was actually \u2013 you saw some at least modest growth, and I think some of that was from the low income business that you were starting to bring in. But so I guess how bad was Australia because it seems like that\u2019s the only major offset in that business to have \u2013 so that you would have had flat to down volumes overall. ", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yeah your math is right. And Australia was down in the teens, and that\u2019s a combination of three things, John. On is the loss of the Bunnings business last year which was a high volume customer, which we talked about in previous calls. Our restructuring did take us out, we closed some stores, they were unprofitable stores. So that had an impact on our revenue, but not on our income and the market is weak, the housing market is weak. So you put those three things together and it was a pretty quarter for the Australian business.", "I will say this though the restructuring plan as I mentioned in my comments is ahead of schedule and that business is ahead of their target for the year in terms of EBIT growth. So some of the \u2013 the first two that I mentioned, the stores and Bunnings were in our plan, we didn\u2019t plan on the weak market but because our restructuring plan is ahead of schedule, we\u2019re compensating for the weak market through the cost savings.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And the first two \u2013 if you are down mid-teens, is that two-thirds of it, like I guess I am just trying to think about when that anniversary, how we should be thinking about kind of the core market growth? With Bunnings and the store closures \u2013", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, the store closings have been happening through the year up until \u2013 I know until the second quarter. Let me \u2013 I will have to ask Tyler to give you a call and walk you through that. I don\u2019t want to say because I am not sure.", "John Mcnulty \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And then just with regard to pricing, can you get more pricing or does the rest of kind of the benefits going forward really just come on the high mix \u2013 the better mix that you \u2013 it looks like you are starting to get?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I don\u2019t want to talk about whether we can get pricing or not. We certainly collaborate with our customers when there is a need for pricing and we have raw material inflation. As I said I expect the raw material inflation to flatten as we go forward. So I am not expecting a lot of benefit from price and the mix that we see in the next couple of quarters.", "Operator", "You do have a question from the line of Ivan Marcuse with Keybanc Capital. ", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "Two quick questions, those have already been answered but if you look at the Latin America business that you discussed, how big of a business is that and what do you think the potential is over the next few years and I guess where do you \u2013 what product group are you seeing the most growth?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We\u2019re seeing, total Latin America business, I will get you get number in a second. I will tell you first the, what we are seeing the growth. We saw growth in packaging coatings, our team took share in packaging coatings in both Mexico and Brazil. We saw our coil business perform very well and our general industrial business performed very well, and all those were -- the market there is only growing at about 3% or so in terms of GDP growth. So to get the kind of result that we get is all about market share gains. So really pleased with our performance. The business itself is a little bit short of $200 million. ", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "I guess my last question would be, in China you\u2019ve \u2013 sort of the construction we missed is really \u2013 at least over the past several quarters, has been focused on the tier 1 cities. So it sounds like you are seeing a little bit of slowing in the tier 2, tier 3 cities but it\u2019s still growing year over year, maybe at a lower rate or how would you sort of describe I guess your core markets in that region?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yeah, our core markets are the tier 2 and three cities, not tier 1, you are right about that. It\u2019s a choppy market \u2013 let me just \u2013 I will say it\u2019s a choppy market. Some of our cities even the tier 2 and 3 cities have been impacted by a slowdown in construction. Others are doing just fine. In aggregate that the market in terms of square meters of construction is down -- you read the same stuff that I do, some at least 10%. I haven\u2019t seen the number that\u2019s less than 10%. But our business is actually performing well in a really rough environment. I will do the same math that I did when I talked about our U.S. consumer business. ", "And we had a strong quarter, last quarter and it was a very strong quarter, and a big part of that was the new product that we\u2019re putting through nonexclusive distribution for the affordable housing market. This quarter our volumes were up slightly but if you average the two together our volumes in our end business were up \u2013 were in the low teens. And that's a really good performance in a market that\u2019s down at least 10% and if you read the competitive comments on the market in their business, we are taking share in that business. So we are pleased that our distributors are committed, they continue to build stores. I think our point of view is that this will pass. I know our distributors\u2019 point of view is this will pass, and the market will recover and we\u2019re going to be really well-positioned when it does.", "Ivan Marcuse \u2013 Keybanc Capital Markets", "In Australia business, I think I did \u2013 I think I caught this that you gained a bid ISR retail \u2013 a new retail customer in Australia, so will that be large enough to offset the Bunnings or when will that business start to start filling, will it be next quarter or did it already start?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I wish it were large enough to offset the Bunnings loss but it\u2019s not -- I believe it\u2019s, I know we\u2019ve signed the contract and I am not a 100% sure we are shipping yet or not. ", "Operator", "You do have a question from the line of Dmitri Silversteyn with Longbow. ", "Eugene Fedotoff - Longbow Research", "Good morning. It\u2019s actually Eugene Fedotoff sitting in for Dmitri. Question on packaging coatings, Gary, you mentioned that this business had excellent quarter. Just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color on that, how much the volume was up and how much revenues you benefitted from Olympics in Europe, just if you can provide a little bit more color on the growth there?", "Gary Hendrickson", "The volumes were still down slightly on a year over year basis, which is a big improvement in that business from the first two quarters of the year where because of weak markets both in Europe and in North America, our business was down both in beverage and in food. So the market hasn't really recovered much. And in fact, if you look at our customers\u2019 comments about particularly their markets in Europe, the food market in Europe in particular, it\u2019s a pretty weak market. But we improved our performance through new business, and they came in all geographies. Our Asia business performed really well up in the 20s in terms of revenue. I already mentioned our Latin America business performed really well and took share. We took share in Europe with three significant customers. And in North America, I mentioned with our none-BPA coatings we took some market share as well. ", "So the improvement that you see is not market related. It\u2019s all about our business, our business people out there taking share.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "", "On your Love Your Color program, I was just wondering how that\u2019s been tracking, if you've been seeing more or less return than anticipated and what type of volume growth it's been driving or at least any type of share shift?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes Nils, and you are right that the key metric there is volume growth. That's really the only metric that we should be concerned about, and I will say that we launched the program in April and every month since then our volumes have grown. And if you take the April through July, our volumes have grown pretty significantly. A lot of that is trade up and that\u2019s people that are trading up from our ultra-premium product below signature to the Valspar signature product. So I wouldn\u2019t care to speculate on whether we\u2019re taking market share or not but we\u2019re certainly achieving our objective of trading up from a lower price points in the department to signature. ", "It\u2019s just in terms of \u2013 so we\u2019re really happy. It\u2019s performing the way we expected it would. And in terms of returns they have been \u2013 if look at the number, and I will call it de minimis. ", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "So with this trade-up, I would assume that there is a mix uplift with two, would you be able to size it for us or how you would think about the mix uplift from the trade-up you are talking about?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I will just say that you are correct in the way that you are thinking about it, that there has been a mix shift. But I prefer not to talk about what that means in terms of dollars or margin et cetera. ", "Nils Wallin \u2013 CLSA", "So then on the China new home sales it looks like in tier 2 and certainly in the tier 3 cities you saw a significant inflection point in new home sales in July and I am wondering since the timing of your end of the your quarter, if you saw the same thing or what you're seeing now in terms of those markets because it was a pretty significant year on year gains at the end of the quarter.", "Gary Hendrickson", "To be honest, I am not sure what you are referring to. You are looking at a study that I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve read. We think the market is still pretty weak in China. And we haven't \u2013 our distributors know our people in the field, or both, we are planning for a weak market through the fourth quarter but that doesn't mean that we can't grow into a weak market. We've demonstrated in the last two quarters that we can grow into a weak market.

In terms of the paint EBIT margins, what drove the sequential decline?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Branding, timing of branding.

The third quarter is always the high point of our year because it's our highest volume quarter and then they will decline as we go into Q4 and Q1. So I wouldn't put 17 into my model for the next quarter, if that's what you're asking.", "It\u2019s all about -- and that's not about price, cost. Phil, that's about volumes then operating leverage. It's the normal. It's the way our company works every year.", "Phil Kirkman - Susquehanna International Group", "And what about looking out towards fiscal \u201813?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think our margins are in pretty good shape. I don't say any more than that. I think price cost is good. It worked. The improvements will come as we continue to win new business. We still have a fair amount of operating leverage in our factories and across our SG&A and so as we continue to grow our company with new business wins, you may see some improvements but those are pretty healthy margins. I think they are some of the strongest industrial margins in the industry.", "Operator", "You do have a question from Mike Hamilton with RBC.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Wealth Management", "I'm wondering if you could give a picture of where you are in stores in China at this stage and what the year-over-year growth of units has been?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think we are at about 2,800 stores and we started the year at about 2,500. And I say about -- that's within 50 stores on year end.", "Michael Hamilton - RBC Wealth Management", "Thanks. More broadly as you look across lines and geographies, is there anywhere \u2013 where you\u2019re bumping up capacity constraints at the stage?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think we mentioned in our last call that we are making an investment in new plant in Tianjin, China and that\u2019s to support the growth of our Huarun business. So, yeah, we need a new plant to support the continuing growth of Huarun, and that's built into our CapEx projections, Mike.", "Operator", "Sir you do have a question from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "", "Hey guys. I got a question on the food packaging coating business, is the drop that we're seeing here in North America, do you expect that to have any meaningful impact on that business?", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're already seeing it Kevin, what you see on the previous question, I answered about the packaging market. I mentioned that the food business is weak, mainly due to weak vegetable pack and the drought that we're experiencing in the U.S. and it's also been weak in Europe. And we\u2019re pretty big player in food can coatings particularly in North America. So that is having the impact on our business. As I mentioned, our team did a very nice job in the quarter of offsetting that with new business in other geographies and segments.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "And speaking of the new business, I think you said it was up mid-single digits or so and I think the last couple of years that's grown 2% or 3%. So it seems like that's accelerating a bit. So could you kind of go through maybe which of the new business was -- are the strongest and growing the fastest and really kind of accelerating that growth?", "Gary Hendrickson", "In coatings, yeah, I looked at our net new business by business just before I came in and let me just say. I'm really pleased with the progress that we've made in every one of those industrial businesses. Our wood coatings business has net new business that's very favorable so does our industrial business, some of that in new markets like container and pipe as we've talked about a lot, and in packaging where we are the market leader, some of our new technology innovations are really proving themselves in the market and they are doing extraordinarily well. So, it's really been across the board. I wouldn't single one out as more important or impactful than the others. All of those businesses are doing really well.", "Operator", "There are no additional questions at this time. Please continue.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining us on the call today. Just to recap, we're pleased with the performance of our business in the quarter. Valspar employees around the world are focused on executing on our growth and productivity initiatives, and as we've said a couple times we remain confident in our guidance of $3.20 to $3.30 for the year.

I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, Jesse. As usual, in order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relations Third Quarter Press Release. Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2012 versus third quarter 2011, consolidated net sales increased 4.8% to $2.6 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores group and selling price increases. Acquisitions increased consolidated net sales approximately 1% in the quarter, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased net sales 2.2%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $112 million to $1.15 billion. Gross margin increased 240 basis points to 44.2% of sales from 41.8% in the third quarter last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher year-over-year selling prices, improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes and slight sales mix benefit.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 5.2% to $799.8 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 30.7% in the third quarter this year, from 30.6% last year. Interest expense was essentially flat at $10.4 million. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $82.7 million or 31.8% to $343 million. Profit before tax as a percent of sales increased to 13.2% from 10.5% last year.", "Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 31.5%, compared to 30.9% in the third quarter of 2011. For the full year 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30% range.", "Consolidated net income increased $55.1 million to $235 million compared to $179.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 9% from 7.2% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 31% to $2.24 per share from $1.71 per share in 2011. Unfavorable currency translation decreased diluted net income per common share $0.05 in the quarter. Acquisitions had no significant impact on earnings per share.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores group in the third quarter increased 9.6% to $1.55 billion. Higher paint sales volumes across all end market segments and selling price increases accounted for most of the increase in sales comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 8.9% in the quarter compared to third quarter last year.", "Regionally, in the third quarter 2012, our southeastern division led the sales performance followed by Southwestern division and Midwestern division -- I'm sorry, Eastern division and Midwestern division. Two Paint Store divisions reported sales increases of above 10% compared to last year. Segment profit for the group increased $63.7 million or 26.9% to $300.6 million in the quarter as higher sales volume and selling price increases were partially offset by higher year-over-year raw material costs and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating margin increased to 19.3% from 16.7% in the third quarter last year.", "Turning to our Consumer group. Sales in the third quarter decreased 1% to $348 million due primarily to lower sales volumes to most of the group's retail customers, partially offset by acquisitions and higher selling prices. Third quarter segment profit for the consumer group increased $16 million or 39.1% to $57.1 million, due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by higher raw material costs. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 16.4% from 11.7% in the same period last year.", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars also decreased 1% to $491.8 million in the quarter, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes and lower paint sales volume, partially offset by selling price increases.", "In the quarter, unfavorable currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 4.6%. Stated in U.S. dollars, third quarter segment profit increased $8.8 million or 32.1% to $36.4 million. Higher selling prices and good expense control more than offset higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency rate changes. Currency rate changes decreased segment profit by $5.1 million in the quarter. As a percent to external net sales, segment profit increased to 7.4% from 5.5% in the third quarter last year.", "Finally, for our Latin American Coatings Group, third quarter net sales in U.S. dollars decreased 4% to $208.7 million, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation rate changes partially offset by selling price increases and higher paint sales volumes. Unfavorable currency decreased net sales by 13.8% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit increased to $21.9 million in the quarter, from $15.9 million last year. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased segment profit $3.7 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 10.5% in the quarter, compared to 7.3% in the third quarter of 2011.", "That concludes my review of the results for the third quarter 2012, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. The third quarter was a solid quarter for Sherwin-Williams in terms of both sales and profit improvement. Consolidated sales increased almost 5%, despite soft market conditions and currency headwinds across most of our nondomestic markets. We also had to overcome the diminishing effect from last year's price increases and a strong revenue growth comparison from the third quarter of last year. Despite that, in many of the financial metrics Bob just walked you through, notably the $2.6 billion in sales for the quarter, $235 million in net income and $2.24 earnings per share, are high watermarks for any quarter in our company's history. Year-to-date, our flow through on operating income is over 31%.", "As encouraging as these results are for us, we still see room for improvement. Three of our 4 operating segments reported soft sales in the quarter, and many of end minivan markets we serve, for example, domestic commercial construction in particular, have not yet emerged from recession. Although we've made progress on the gross profit line, our consolidated gross margin remains well below our all-time high of 46% on a full year basis.", "If you look at our third quarter results by segments, they were pretty much in line with our expectations. Paint Stores group once again delivered strong year-over-year sales growth at a pace that we believe is comfortably ahead of the industry, roughly half of the segment's revenue growth came from volume. Our investments in new store openings and superior store staffing continues to drive market share growth. Our Consumer group, Global Finishes group and Latin American Coatings Group, reported strong profit for the quarter despite weak demand in many regions of the world. Combined sales of the 3 segments declined slightly, while combined profit increased more than 36%.", "The silver lining around weakening international paint coatings demand is the effect it has on raw material cost. Over the past 6 months, the price of high grade chloride, titanium dioxide had eased somewhat due to declining global demand. We've also seen a modest downward trend in the price of propylene, a key feedstock for monomers, latex, solvents and containers. We believe these trends are likely to continue. Based on these developments, we now expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation for the paint and coatings industry to be in the mid-single-digit range in 2012, down from our previous guidance of mid- to high-single digits. Although the rate of input cost inflation appears to be moderating, the 240-basis-point increase in our third quarter gross margin was helped by better operating efficiencies in our Consumer group. Comparing our 9-month gross margin of 43.9% to last year's 42.7%, perhaps provides a better representation of the progress we've made in offsetting multi-year, raw material inflation with price increases and mix improvement.", "SG&A spending was up $40 million in the quarter and increased 10 basis points as a percent to sales. Through the largest contributors to this increase for the new stores opened in the past 12 months, higher incentive compensation as a result of strong financial performance and incremental SG&A from acquisitions.", "In the third quarter, we generated $367 million in net operating cash, bringing our 9-month net operating cash to $569 million, an increase of $123 million over the same period last year. Year-to-date, cash from operations has increased $182 million to $628 million. Nine month free cash flow, and we measure free cash flow as net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was at $346 million. We continue to use this cash to invest in the company and expand our control distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions, increased our dividend and purchase shares of our stock for treasury. In the first 9 months, our Paint Stores group added 28 net new stores, 8 of which were opened in the third quarter. This brings our total store count in the U.S. and Canada and the Caribbean to 3,478 locations, compared to 3,421 a year ago. Our plan calls for Paint Stores group to add approximately 60 to 65 net new store locations during this year.", "In the third quarter, we bought back 500,000 shares of our common stock on the open market, bringing our year-to-date total to 3.8 million shares at an average purchase price of $113.96. On September 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire 17.25 million shares.", "Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.39 per share, up from $0.365 last year. It is increasingly obvious that the global economy is slowing, and that risk to the U.S. economy has increased accordingly. However, to date, paint and coatings demand in our domestic businesses has been resilient. We remain optimistic that U.S. architectural paint market volumes primarily in the residential segments, will remain positive in the fourth quarter of 2012 and well beyond, and domestic demand for most industrial coatings will continue to expand. The greatest challenges going forward are likely be worsening market conditions in Latin America and Europe, and the increasingly difficult comparisons. Our outlook for fourth quarter 2012 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-single digits, compared to last year's fourth quarter. With sales at this level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $0.98 to $1.18 per share, compared to $0.14 per share in 2011, which included a $0.71 per share charge last year for our IRS settlement. For the full year 2012, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by a high single-digit percentage over last year. With annual sales at that level, we've raised our expectation for diluted net income per common share for 2012 to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share, compared to $4.14 earned in 2011. Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I guess I'm struck by your overall incremental gross margin in the quarter, which I think was about 95%, and it looks like your cost of goods sold didn't really change year-over-year. So I imagine that some of the raw material benefits that the industry is seeing are now making a larger impression on your income statement even in this quarter. Is that right?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would not say it, Jeff. And I would tell you that, I'd like to paraphrase it this way, and hopefully, it'll explain it. When raw materials are rising, your LIFO expense is catching up. It's always -- is, it's like trying to catch up, and when you start to hit the peak, our LIFO index will still be greater than 1 this year, but that's why we continually talk about the year-to-date, because of all the different things that are going through that cost of goods sold and what you're seeing is last year, the raws were rising dramatically in the third and fourth quarter of last year, so our LIFO is catching up, and that's why we continue to do some of those things. So when I look at it, I think, as Chris said, the 43.9% versus the 42.7%, when you start doing those analysis instead of -- when we start looking at cap variances and LIFO and all the other things that are going on that are affected by those different things, but I think that our year-to-date is probably a better indication. I think the fourth quarter, our gross margin will be higher than last year. I think our gross margin for the year will be at or slightly higher than we are year-to-date. So I think you're going to see, progressively, our gross margin continues to get stronger, and I think that's when you're going to -- I think you're going to see that more in the future, but I think that you can't look at the gross margin in third quarter versus last year, that percentage and say, okay, that's what we're going to see in the future. Last year gross margin in the fourth quarter is 42.8%. That's why I really -- it's, I got a lot of confidence we're going to repeat last year's but, that's why I think year-to-date, we're actually going to see a 43.9% or slightly above that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just going back to the store count of 28 versus your guidance, 60 to 65. Is this sort of a timing issue? Or is there a larger store network that's available that's, perhaps giving you some pause as you build out your stores?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Ghasham, this has been the historic pattern at Sherwin, despite -- lots of attempts to the contrary. We like to lay these stores in on a little bit more of an orderly path, but for a variety of reasons, many of them outside of our control, for example, real estate developers, communities getting permits passed, et cetera. This always tends to be a heavy fourth quarter waiting. So all the work that we've been doing on these single store, real estate negotiations, getting ready to open these stores, they all just tend to kind of unwind here in the fourth quarter. So we'll hit that number through individual stores.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And just a sort of a higher-level question, right, so Europe isn't huge for you, and a lot of companies in different industries are sort of reassessing whether they want to be in Europe longer-term. Just given what's happened there, does that change any of your strategy or strategic ambitions for that market over time for Sherwin?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we've been pretty clear about our interest in Europe. We do not have an architectural paint -- desire to be there for a variety of reasons. We, we're in the country, to participate in the Global Industrial Coatings businesses, primarily industrial wood coatings. And at this point in time, there's not been any indication that we'd be strengthening our position over there. I'm happy to have business that we have, and working hard to get them integrated and improve their operating margins.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about the volume breakdown between the same-store channel and the consumer channel? It seems like there was a big dichotomy between the 2 channels, with contractor market really turning around this year. And then just a follow-up on that is, do you expect the contractor market to grow at the same level next year as this year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So your first part of your question, P.J., is absolutely correct. The stores had a solid quarter again, almost 10% sales gain, and we commented that approximately half of it was from volume. So again, outperforming, we think, the market conditions. And our consumer group had a soft quarter in sales and there were some pricing there as well, so volumes were even a little softer than that. So there is that dichotomy happening. We've been commenting about the rebounding residential markets in the United States. We're seeing really good numbers coming out now on new construction, and then the result of that, I think the contractor is strengthening, as a larger portion of the U.S. architectural purchasing.", "Robert J. Wells", "And as far as the question of next year, we're, we always give guidance on our January phone call when we really don't have any indication on the gallonage forecast for 2013. We'll give you guidance in January when we report the full year numbers.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And just quickly on the Paint Stores group. Chris, I think you had mentioned earlier at your Analyst Day, that you're keeping your stores open longer, anticipating higher demand? Can you just give us an update on that? And also, on your Platinum paint, which is I think your paint plus primer for the contractor market?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So from a store hour perspective, P.J., let's say we're always kind of looking at that and tweaking that and we've marginally increased our hours across some markets, a little bit later on weeknights, a little bit longer on Saturday and Sunday, but I don't think that's a significant impact to the company's overall performance. Our recent innovative product launch is in stores, primarily been focused around Emerald, which is this high-end, top-of-the-line zero VOC performance product, which is really doing quite well for the company. As a reminder, when we talk about new product sales, we're identifying those products that have been introduced and have 3 years of run life still, and as group, they account for less than 10% of our revenue. So while we're excited about this new product launch, and what it's doing in the market for our overall mix, it's not a dramatic mover for the company.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. I was wondering if you could comment on your level of inventory on titanium dioxide, and maybe compare it to, say normal levels or where you were a year ago. And then just kind of related to that, as you mentioned over the last 6 months, high-grade chloride, TiO2 prices have come down or at least moderated a bit, and there's definitely a perception that they're going to continue to decline at the year end into the first quarter. So would you look to run down your inventories even further in anticipation of lower prices in the coming year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No. We look at our inventory of titanium dioxide, as a raw material. It's very comparable, what it has been for the last few quarters, including last year. We didn't dramatically change, and I don't see us changing that anytime soon. We turn our raw materials so quickly, especially on some of these raws, and as we go into the end of the season, the production plan in the fourth quarter will be normal as, and we're going to make less payments fourth quarter than we have in any other quarter. And then in the first quarter, we'll start to ramp back up. But no plans on changing that normalized view of what we're going to do with our raw materials.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And Brian, with respect to our expectations for TiO2 pricing from here, I'm sure it didn't go unnoticed that earlier this week, one of the major TiO2 producers reported earnings and reported volumes in the third quarter down 18%. I suspect that probably the other global chloride producers experienced similar volume declines in the quarter, and that would tend to put pricing pressure on TiO2, downward pricing pressure on TiO2. To your point, we think that, that spot market pricing in TiO2 is probably down in the 10% range, year to date, and perhaps with quite a bit further to go.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I guess I might just have been confused why wouldn't try and run down the inventories more or is it just the case that you are already kind of at safety stock levels in and now or do you expect prices to decline in response to the volume drop.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. We don't really think about it, running raw inventory down based on cost, I mean we run  an efficient, lean supply chain here. We're turning these raw materials multiple, multiple times a year. We store this stuff in slurry tanks and it really, we have the raw material we need to make the paint we're going to make in the next week or 2. So not a lot of room to run this stuff down.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We'll turn titanium back, set between 30 and 34 times a year, so you're talking a 1.5 weeks\u2019 worth of supply. That's 10 days. We sit there and say, moving at the 5 days, what is the net effect? It's not that great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Trey Grooms of Stephens Incorporated.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Kind of following on that TiO2 being here, just some of your competitors have been out mentioning that they'll be able to substitute a significant amount of their chloride TiO2 consumption with the lower-priced sulfate TiO2, and I know in the past, you guys have said that you have a limited ability to kind of do that. Can you kind of give us an update, kind of where you stand on that today? And then also, kind of what do you think of the impact could be on TiO2 pricing as these coatings guys tend to do more substitution there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Trey, I think we've heard a number of our competitors comment about the ability to eliminate 5%, 10%, perhaps of their annual chloride titanium demand based on replacement technologies, innovative chemistry, a whole host of practices. I think what we've commented is that we don't see that number being unreachable for us either. We just would be a later adopter. Professional painting contractors, demand for the consistency in our product means that some of these technologies will more likely wind their way into our next round of new products we launch as opposed to going into our core product line and replacing chloride with some of these other technologies. Outside the United States, I think we can do that a little bit easier. We don't use tint base and in-store tinting as much. In Latin America, for example, we do a lot more factory color blending. In that environment, you can switch from the chloride grade directly to the sulfide grade. So some of that activity's taking place as we speak. But I think this is going to be in the margin in terms of replacing it. Though the bigger impact here is that Bob has mentioned in the past has been this softening in the global demand and as a result of that, pricings will come down.", "Trey Grooms - Stephens Inc., Research Division", "Okay, thanks. And then a question on the Emerald line that you touched on earlier. Can you give us a little bit more color on, kind of what the reception has been? It sounds like it's been pretty good, but is that more kind of DIY-focused or more contractor-focused, and then, also kind of how the pricing differs there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. It's rarely that we bring a product line out that doesn't have to serve all customer segments, and there's a huge component of this product that we expect the residential repaint contractor to find attractive, and in fact, that's exactly what's happening, Trey. We've seen really good demand across that line. The things that we use to kind of measure the strength of the new product introductions for the company. One would be, are we kind of hitting the targets of gallons that we've set forth at its launch, and we're well ahead of that pace, and secondarily, and perhaps even more important, you hear us talk often about the mix shift inside our company. And as we bring these products out on the very high-end of our product assortment, often times we'll see customers move up inside the other product lines, but had been defined as product is now one level below, and we're seeing nice volume gains in that product which is a product we call Duration as well. So it's having all the kind of impact we'd like to see as a result of this kind of product launch, and quite pleased with it at this point in time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chris, if you had to hazard a guess, where would you see U.S. architectural coatings industry gallonage finishing up for 2012? Trying to get a sense of how far below normalized levels we are still at this point?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I would think the growth number, Kevin, is probably going to be around 2% to 3%, and I think we're commenting around 2% to 4% halfway through the year. It appears to be moderating a little bit. So on a basis of 615 million gallons for the industry last year, approximately 2% to 3% pop from there.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And so if I peg normalized at maybe 730 to 750 or so, it sounds like you're maybe 15% below, is that fair?", "Christopher M. Connor", "That's fair.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, just a follow-up, Chris. Be curious to hear your updated views of what you're seeing in the private market since the Geocel deal, which wasn't all that large, you've been pretty quiet or disciplined, shall I say. With the downturn overseas, do you anticipate any opportunities to kind of reinvigorate acquisitions in overseas markets?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Kevin, I think we've stayed very disciplined around the strategic targets that we've shared with the Street repeatedly, namely architectural businesses in the Americas that can kind of strengthen our control distribution play or have really strong compelling brands throughout the Latin American markets, and then smaller bolt-on acquisitions to support our Industrials Coatings businesses, wherever they may be around the world. The fact that we've had a little bit of a softer period here on M&A has not -- anything to do with our interest or the number of doors we're knocking on and the folks we're courting. And when we find things that fit those models and return the kind of disciplined returns we expect, we'd be one to pull the trigger. We have commented that traditionally, a lot of these architectural businesses are owned by private families, and they tend to not want to sell into the down market, but as things start to improve, they've become a little bit more interested in valuing their assets, and so we would expect that maybe over the next couple of years, we'll start to see a little bit more activity there, but nothing to report on today.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then, final question if I may, I'll turn it over, is on tax rate. Sean, it's just been creeping up ever so slightly the last 3 quarters. Is that a function of geographic mix? And do you have any preliminary thoughts on where you might be tracking for 4Q in 2013?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think you're 100% right. It is geographic as -- our Stores group, Consumer group has done very, very well. I think that, we still think that we're going to be able to maintain the tax rate in the low 30s. But, I would say, we're going to be slightly below or slightly above next year where we finish the year this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty of Credit Suisse.", "Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Abhi Rajendran calling in for John. A quick question on raws and pricing, I guess with the softness in both TiO2, and then even some of the rest of your baskets. Are there any areas where you're having to give back on pricing? Maybe you could just touch a little bit on that?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think, Abhi, we've commented that in past cycles like this, typically the industry's done a nice job of hanging on to pricing. It's sticky on the way up -- I'm sorry, it's tough on the way up and rather sticky at the top. We did comment that we're still quite a ways below our all-time high in gross margins. So I think there's still work to do that here. We would expect to see in the industry, on large commercial projects heading into next year, if in fact these raws continue to roll over, that we will see some lower prices quoted on these significant volume opportunities. But again, that's somewhat consistent with past practices as well. So we'll see how this one plays out, but that would be our expectation.", "Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And just a quick follow up, could you talk a bit about any potential availability issues or upcoming increases is cost for your acrylics purchases?", "Robert J. Wells", "We don't anticipate any tightening in those markets. Propylene has been trending down, along with TiO2. We're paying a lower price for propylene per pound today than we would at the beginning of the year. And that, to us, kind of signals ample supply in the market. So we don't see any problems with acrylic pricing or any of the petrochemical-based materials we buy being tighter going forward.", "Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then last quick one, if I may. On M&A, I guess do you have any preferences as to smaller, bolt-on acquisitions? Or are you looking at more medium-sized opportunities as well? Maybe you could just touch a little bit on that.", "Christopher M. Connor", "We like the ones that return the best profit for the shareholders, regardless of size.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer of Barclays Capital.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I want to go back to the question on incremental and I was looking at incremental EBIT margins throughout the year. It's been very healthy, kind of running anywhere between 23% and 47% this quarter. Could you split out, in those incremental margins, how much is kind of been the volume leverage, and how much has been catch up on raw material price increases from a year ago?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think when you take a look at our gross margin year-to-date, 120 basis points, and you look at the volumes that the stores group has created year-to-date, and consumers' year-to-date results, I think that both of those, well over 75%, I don't have an exact numbers, volume. I think that we do, we give a lot more leverage on volumes than we do price, and because a lot of times, the price is really motivated by higher raw materials. So to answer your questions, it's the majority of volume.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Terrific. And then, if you take a quick look forward to '13, what do you see that, this year might've been one-off? So we had the warmer Q1, so when we think about year-over-year comps going into next year, what things could we be looking for that might not repeat, either good or bad?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes. I think when you take a look at the first quarter, I think you said it correctly. I think as -- we're not prepared to talk about next year, but we think that the first quarter, when you look at the sales increase and the gallons increase and the weather that we experienced, some of it had to deal with weather. And I think over the full year, I think that might be timing, but I do think that we still feel that, if the market, in the total year goes up, we're going to gain market share. And so, we think that's really our long-term thought. So we look at it. Besides that, I don't think -- I can't think of anything that was -- I think this has been one of the more normal years, expect for the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ivy Zelman of Zelman & Associates.", "Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "Chris, you mentioned that the domestic resiliency that you're experiencing should mitigate the slowing globally? And we certainly saw strength in the Paint Stores and obviously, coming from the underlying strength of the new construction market that you spoke to. But can you dig in a little bit more for us, understanding the end markets with respect to what's happening, mass merchants versus a retail or a consumer-oriented customers, as well as sort of the non-res commercial markets. We know public spending, is obviously, it's got a major headwinds versus private spending. What you could drill in at any more detail, and whether you're optimistic that you're seeing anything that would suggest things are going to lag, like they normally do, the residential improvement and new construction.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So there's a lot to chew on there, Ivy. But let's start with, kind of the mass merchants' performance. We reported that our consumer group had a soft quarter. And when we look inside our own stores, at our own DIY business, it was one of the poor performing of the segments inside that store's business, so I think there may be some softening there a little bit. Hard to tell, if it's just a blip for the quarter or a longer trend. What impact the election, I mean, the uncertainties having in that area. I think it's a little early to make that call. Some of the more dependable segments that we can look at and think through and plan out on both residential, whether that's new residential or residential repaint, continue to be the real strength for the company. These are our segments that are performing high single-digits, low double-digits, in terms of year-over-year performance in the quarter, and then as we've commented briefly in the opening statement, relative to the commercial market still, it's lagging, and we would expect that to be that way, it tends to follow housing, so if housing comes back, we would expect new commercial construction to rebound and that would be a little bit of a tailwind for the company. We're encouraged by the housing start permit numbers that we saw out this week, and I mean, to Sean's point, we look at the next year, I think we're feeling pretty good that this residential market in the United States has still got a lot of runway.", "Ivy Lynne Zelman - Zelman & Associates, Research Division", "If you broke out and looked at the business, excluding public spending for non-res projects, would it look any different? Or is it also soft within that spending market if you take it in sort of an aggregate look?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Right. We -- when we break it down by ZIP code and so forth, it's the softness is -- public in, public, Ivy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson of Nomura Securities.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Hoping you can just shed some light on a couple of things. One, you mentioned the efficiencies inside the Consumer group. Can you give us a little bit more detail about what it is that you're doing to  improve those efficiencies? And then second, I know your SG&A growth as a percent of sales growth looked a little high in this quarter. I think you generally target that around 40% or 50%. And then the last thing is if you can give us the gross margins by category, at least those gross profit cells that are so helpful every other quarter, and I'd appreciate that.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure, okay. The couple of things on the consumer group, I think just by on putting gallons through those plans, I think that you gain efficiencies. We have many projects that are ongoing, whether they're raw material delivery or fill lines and so forth, and you're -- really a lot of singles and doubles there that continue to do very well for us. As we continue to get other plants underneath that management team, Geocel and so forth, you're going to see improvements there. But #1, is really just getting those gallons through and the efficiencies that those gallons will create. The second question, I think, hopefully I remember all 3. But your SG&A, you talk about the SG&A and I think that the SG&A, a lot of the SG&A growth we had was in the United States. And where -- as we continue to develop new stores, as we continue to put new stores in, putting people in the stores, hours in the stores, as well as we've continued to spend on the -- in the admin segment. As for IT projects that eventually, down the road, will create higher cash flow for us in nondomestic markets. So when the FX effect had so much effect on the sales in a couple of our segments, in the U.S., the SG&A will go up. And I think when you look at us, compared to sales, but I think if you look at it year-to-date, and notice the 30.7% in the quarter versus 30.6%, we're up 10 basis points. But year-to-date on SG&A, we're down 60 basis points, and I think when you start to look at it on a year-to-date basis, those targets that we usually hit are, we're a lot closer to that. So I think that all the operating margins by operating segment, our operating margins are fine, but things are going pretty well. On the -- on the Paint Stores group sales, incremental margin dollars were $93.7 million. Consumer group was $20.7 million. Global Finishing group was a positive $3.9 million and Latin American group was actually negative $5.7 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich of ISI Group.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Matt McGinley on for Greg. If we go back to the Consumer group for a minute. I'm still not sure I completely understand what happened with the units here. Did you see a draw down on the sundry product that you sell, as well as the coatings? And in terms of, if you have access to point-of-sale data, are you seeing a self -- issues of sell-through versus inventory depletion, and have the channel partners that you sell into there, have they, perhaps attempted to reduce their inventories to try and push back on price? Or are you starting to have those conversations with those retailers?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Matt, on the mix between paint and various sundries, I would say is, it's very consistent across the board of all the baskets and material we sell, that it was just a soft quarter. Then I think that's more indicative of the kind of foot traffic and a little slower out-the-door performance. As usual, this time of year, we do see some inventory focus from some of these partners where they're trying to squeeze inventory a little bit, and that happens frequently, and so I don't think that we can put it entirely at that. For the 9 months, numbers for all these categories there all positive, and they're all doing well, and so we'll just have to see what their -- this is a, falling off or just a little bit of a quarter blip here. In terms of pricing, we're always have those conversations with our partners, and they're -- pay close attention to the feed-stocks of these businesses and so I would expect that, that's something we'll be dealing with going forward.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then my second question is back on the SG&A. Given you had pretty good sales growth, and I understand that you had your -- you're doing investments, there's new stores you're putting out, you've done some acquisitions and I assume that the higher incentive expense wouldn't stay that high forever. But at what point would you expect to leverage SG&A at a higher level? Is it -- should I think about it terms of the unit growth? Should I think about it in terms of a sales level that you would achieve? Or, I guess when would you have better SG&A leverage, given the pretty high rate of sales you experienced this year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. And I think when you take a look at it, we've -- it's also where the sales growth has come in the stores group. I think they'll continue to invest, I think again, you've mentioned the comp. I think that the comp -- but I think we've set the company up, that we're going to have a couple of years of nice SG&A growth. I think, or I mean, not growth, but improvement as a percent of sales. We hit our highest 35.7%, last year around 33.1%. I think -- as -- or 33.8%. I think you're going to see some of that improvement over time.", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think, for the next period of time over the next couple of years, you're going to see that SG&A  improve.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "What do you think that, that would get to as a percentage of sales over time?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "What we've commented is, that we used to just talk about a 33%, 33.5%, we think that, and then we start seeing the 10, 20 basis points improvement. With the change, we think that we're probably at 33%, and then you're going to start seeing that 10 or 20 basis points improvement. And that's an annual number. I know we're below that through the first 3 quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two things. First of all, you talked about gaining share, a good amount in the Architectural Paint business, I think that's sort of what you're talking about. Can you talk about what's driving that? And then also, related to that, you've taken them, if there's a little bit cautious and more cautious to you on growth. Can you just again, define what you're seeing different, in terms of growth?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Eric, I think from a share perspective, there's a couple of things that we can look at. Industry gallon data, which used to be reported by the federal government, is not anymore, we're cobbling together these points from raw material suppliers and other industry sources. Our sense is that the market's grown, probably on a volume basis, around 2% to 3%, and so we're able to look at the kind of gallons we're putting through our footprint here and feel comfortable that, that's outperforming the market. When we look inside the performance in the individual segments, these professional painting contractor segments are outperforming, and just as we saw those get harder hit in the industry downturn, they're the ones that are rebounding a little quicker as we're going forward. So our expectation would be that we continue to see that kind of share shift towards the painter, and we continue to benefit from them.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "On the second one, Eric, when you asked about our outlook. One of the things that we've commented on the last few calls is that, the gallons may continue to be strong, but the selling price is going to -- it's not going to be as strong. Think about couple of -- and I'll tell you right now, when you look at the third quarter to fourth quarter, you heard Chris comment on the Stores group, half of that growth was volume, half of it was approximately price. We think that the price between third and fourth quarter of 2012, we're going to have half of what we realized in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter. So and we also think that the headwinds on the nondomestic will not be as strong, and I think that all comes back to that mid-single digits. So I think that it's not so much that we feel we're not that worried about our get a little worried about volume. I think it's we're seeing less and less price in that Paint Stores group.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Great, and then secondly, you talked about gross margin relative to the peak at 46%. I'm just curious what you think the path from here to there is what drives that, how long that path might be.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. The path will be along the lines of the pricing, finishing off and as you know the last price increase we've announced through our Stores business was in February, so that one\u2019s just about behind us. You're going to see the efficiency through the whole supply chain adding some lift to that, as volume continues to go through that fixed asset base in our Consumer group, and then obviously, as the raws tip over, and we can hang onto pricing per the earlier question. That'll help us get there. Whether that happens in the span of a year or 2 or 3, we're not making any comments on that.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And we also need some help from non-stores and nonconsumer segments. I think when you look at the lower operating margins, I think that some of the things we've done to improve, especially in the Global Finishes Group, again, we feel pretty good about the ongoing integration, and we think that'll help us with our gross margin, as well as operating margin in the future, and that'll help us get back on the peak.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Nocella of RBC Capital Markets.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just in Latin America, you had very strong margins in the third quarter, both sequentially and year-over-year. Maybe you can just help us understand how you will achieve those margins? And maybe give us your early read on demand in Latin America as we enter their seasonally stronger period now?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I would tell you right now, we hit positive volumes in Latin America in the third quarter, and you're right, the fourth quarter is stronger for us than the fourth quarter (sic), just having more of that will help us improve our margin in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. And I think it's going to be volume in there, and also just -- we're continuing to work on selling prices in the Latin America group.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And can you just comment on your outlook for new store growth for next year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We've been saying that we'd expect to continue to increase that and ramp up. We identify kind of that 50 store pace, or 1 store a week is kind of idle speed and as markets improve, that we would be ramping that back up. We haven't given guidance on that yet, but we have said that over a longer decade period, on a more normalized run rate, kind of 70 to 80 stores is the right average to be at. So we'll be north of the 60 to 65 number that we're going to do this year and next year, and we'll you some more clarity on that on the first quarter call.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Charles Dan of Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just to clarify, do you guys have any LIFO liquidation benefit in the quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would say no.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And it seemed like you slowed down the pace of your share repurchases and brought down the leverage on the balance sheet. Can you give us some perspective on why that might have slowed, and how we should think about the share count going forward?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think when we look at a stock buybacks, we're always talking about an annualized number. So far this year, we've brought back 3.8 million shares, spent $433 million, that's about $100 million more than last year. Our -- we feel pretty good about where we are, I think that we probably bought it. We're watching a lot of different things right now. We're -- we like where our balance sheet is. Our balance sheet's in a pretty good spot if some of these assets would become available here in the fourth quarter or early first quarter, so we're watching that. And that's what we've always said. We don't see over time that our debt is going to go down. Our EBITDA's been strong. So we're still going to target that 1:1 when it comes to EBITDA. So over time, we'll spend that money either on acquisitions or stock buybacks. So we've looked at it. We still feel pretty good about where we are, buying 3.8 year-to-date, and that's what we do. We looked a lot at it, on an annual, not a quarter-by-quarter number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just have a couple of quick questions. First, for the quarter, what was the -- your material cost, up year-over-year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We will -- maybe you talk about the full basket, but for us, we never comment on ours, and usually we don't even comment on a quarter-to-quarter, but usually on a year-to-date. And I think what we've said is that, our raw material baskets, beginning in the year, we were looking at high single digit, low teens, and now we're saying that it's going to be in that low single digits. So you can probably tell that most of the increase was in the first half of the year.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then in the Paint Stores, I think you give the gross profit dollar increase, what was the SG&A dollars?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "That, I will tell you, I\u2019ll have to look up the Q. I'll grab it out of the Q, and then -- it's 27.4.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then the last question is, when you look forward, you've had great leverage that you\u2019ve shown, so it's like, I guess you're going to be in the high single-digit sales, and then somewhere around 30% type of earnings growth. Would you expect the same -- is -- would that ratio change, going forward over the next couple of years? Or is there any reason it would or wouldn't?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think as Sean commented on one of the earlier answers, it really is about volumes, so the extent that, that volume number keeps going at that pace, that's the kind of leverage that we can get through the system.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of North Coast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "I want to get back to the administrative costs and the SG&A costs. Sean, if I go through the segments and back out, a couple of adjustments, you guys show those administrative costs. How much of that is including IT projects and acquisition-related SG&A that's allocated to the quarters, or exclusive was allocated to the quarters, and how much is -- has to be explained by other things?.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, I would say the majority of it is, as we mentioned before and actually in the admin segments and you look at the admin segments through 9 months is $54 million higher than last year. You take out some of the environmental hits and disposition of assets, you're down to about the high 40s, just about half of that is in compensation. And probably another 30%, 40% of that is IT projects and investments and so forth and especially on acquisitions that eventually, we think they create cash flows from our nondomestic operations.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Now with the volume growth in the stores business, how is the SG&A up? Because I would think that would be good opportunity to leverage occupancy and in store labor, but are there other things to consider?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. We talked about the incentive compensation, Chuck. We were riding this market down, we\u2019re paying a lot of bonuses. And we've told you, we've got practically that entire Stores organization on variable comp plans. So they're having a good year.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "So their incentive comp hits below the segments, as well as within some of the segments.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "That's true. Some of the variable compensation and RSOs and other things and annual bonuses are held at the administrative segment. But I wanted to correct something. When we did say that our SG&A in the store was up $27 million, I don't want to give you the idea that our SG&A there didn't -- did go higher in terms of sales, but it didn't dramatically go down, but you sit then take look at it, the operating margin is up, and it's been helped by margin as well as SG&A. I think when we were talking about the SG&A in total, because of those dollars, and then the other sales numbers were negatively affected by FX, those numbers then become -- it's more dramatic, higher global sales, not just store sales.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And then on LIFO, can you give us what the LIFO charge was year-over-year, the comparable numbers?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think LIFO -- I'll tell you, I'm going to get back to you on that one.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Just 2 questions. One, just wondering why you're a little more cautious on overall growth, I think you said you thought total U.S. gallonage now is up 2% to 3%. You were thinking maybe 3% to 4% earlier in the year. And then on stores, I mean, you talk about how Paint Stores sales group is, contractors gaining share from the big box. But are you gaining share from some of your competitors\u2019 stores? I noticed that Akzo had their U.S. stores volumes continue to be down year-over-year. Ben Moore's having issues, so I'm just wondering how much you're benefiting there, and does that create an opportunity to be more aggressive on store openings as competitors pull back a bit?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Don, regarding the U.S. growth of architectural market. I think we've been looking at some of the -- our competitors releases here, and commenting about some softness in the U.S. architectural market. We don't really have a good data other than when it comes lagging to us a little bit. So I wouldn't read too much into our earlier estimates was 2% to 4%, now we're 2% to 3%. It could be very much in line with what we've been saying. As Sean commented on one of the earlier questions, the volume numbers through our store business has been fine, we've just been seeing the impact of price roll back a little bit. So we're not feeling very cautious here in our guidance. We're feeling that we're still seeing the strong U.S. residential, architectural market and we're feeling good about the position the company is in. And capitalize on that, increasing store counts next year over this year, so all those things are making us feel like we've got a long way to go here to capitalize on this rebounding residential market. In terms of gaining share within the channel against some of the other small, independent paint store chain operators and/or regional or national operators as you mentioned Akzo. Yes, I think we would feel comfortable that we're doing that as well. We know that just by store count, for one way to get at it, we've put these or plan to have these 60 to 65 stores in this year. That will be a significant multiple of the rest of the competitors combined, and in fact, on those independents, we've seen quite a number of those stores. We think perhaps as many as 1,000 of them have gone out over the last 3 to 4 years during this downturn. So clearly gaining share inside the paint store channel as well.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Don, one more kind of color point on the residential repaint market. Chris mentioned in his opening comments that DIY was one of the market segments that was probably softer than most. Don't read that as a decline in demand in -- for residential repaint, because residential repaint contractor volume is actually pretty strong. What we may be saying is kind of this discretionary shift back towards the contractor and away from DIY.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions or the couple of comments you made about the raw material pricing. You said that propylene pricing is coming down, and you implied you're buying propylene. Are you in fact, buying propylene? Are you buying propylene derivatives?", "Christopher M. Connor", "It's the latter. We are actively buying propylene-based commodities.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Right, okay. Is your -- is the products that you're purchasing, whether it's resins or packaging or solvents, have you seen pricing there decline?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We have. It typically declines on a 90 to 120 day lag. So we're just starting to feel the impact of the decline in propylene. And as you know, the decline in propylene has been kind of a long, slow decline, as opposed to a sharp drop.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So the important point though is that you are seeing the downstream products made from propylene starting to decline for you in price?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, some of them.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Excellent. Then the second question, on the Global sales I -- or the Global Group sales. I'm sort of finding that the comments in the press release a little bit confusing. You talked about 9 month or through the 9 month year-over-year, having about a 2.4% contribution I think you said from acquisitions, which implies that the acquisitions were negative in the third quarter. That doesn't make sense. Can you take me through the sales components in the Global group?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I'll tell you what. How about if we go to the next question, we'll come back -- let me, give me a second to pull that out, okay, Dmitry?", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "That's fine. And then, my last question, again, has to do with the Consumer group and the -- sort of the declining volumes have [indiscernible] margin based on more gallons processed. I think that, that refers to the gallonage growth that you're seeing in the -- in your store group, which flows through the consumer group margin. Is that the right way to put it?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. That's exactly right. The consumer group is the North American supply chain provider for the company. So every gallon manufactured, distributed through the chain, supporting their consumer's external brands, as well as other stores go through that P&L, so you're getting the lift as volume goes through that control asset base, we transfer that on a fully loaded price to our stores. But as volume comes and efficiencies are enhanced, consumer can get the leverage on that operating margin, and that's how they get to the numbers you saw today.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And Dmitry, if I go back to that answer for the acquisitions, you're right. The acquisitions on a 9 month is 2.4%, and it was 0 for the third quarter. That's because we've annualized it.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So my calculation is correct. It just sounded...", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. We no longer put the quarter in there because we've annualized it. I understand what the confusion there was, but no, it wasn't flat or down.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nils Wallin from CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "The NAHPs remodeled index came out and it's at above -- it\u2019s at 50, and it's probably at one of the highest levels since '05, and even in the peak. But most of it seems to come from the owner occupied side, as it goes to rental properties or in major alterations. So I'm wondering if the rental part of that index or the major alterations, if those move up towards 50, is that going to have a meaningful impact on your results?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, it will. And multifamily's an important segment for us, and unlike the owner occupied residential, which can be a DIY project or a painting contractor project, typically in multifamily, you're seeing a paying contractor being employed to do that, so as that segment strengthens, that's good for our industry.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "So then, would you say that most of your contractor business is then still focused on the single-family, as opposed to the multifamily? Or is there just -- I mean is there just a different mix there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well the weight in the country would indicate that we have probably 60% to 65% of American citizens are in an owned-occupied thing, 35% to 40% would be in rental property. So to the extent that of contractors are doing a lot of work in the residential repaints for an owner-occupant, that still the larger segment for us, but we still have a sizable business in this multifamily. As that improves, as occupancy rates improve, as turnover improves, because that's when you get the painting opportunity, those will all be drivers for volume through our stores group.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Great. And then just one final question. The kind of softness in Global Finishes. I know that you've obviously, you highlighted regions outside of North America were you don't have as big a presence as some of your competitors, but I was wondering if you would be able to drill down to say, whether it was on the Protective and Marine side, or auto with finishes, if there's any differences there in those different end markets.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. The biggest peak for business we have in Global Finish group is our OEM product finishes. This is where we're coating durable goods in a manufactured factory environment for sales and I think that's been probably the softer of the 3 segments. The Protective and Marine coatings, which is also embedded in here has probably been the stronger of the 3 segments and Automotive would be somewhere in the middle.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of Buckingham Research.", "John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "One of your largest global competitors had some uncertainty in the executive suite right now, and their U.S. strategy has been a little bit debatable. Does that already see to maintaining some flexibility here over the next couple of quarters to see whether or not they shift gears?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No. I think that there's a lot of different things out there right now. I don't think specifically that asset is causing us to keep our balance sheet flexible.", "John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Okay. How about store openings? Might want to wait to see what happens to store openings?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No. Their store model has been diminishing as an impactful competitor and our plans to continue opening stores are in line with our long-term strategy of building out density, strengthening some of the weaker markets, and that doesn't change regardless of their actions.", "Operator", "Our final question of the day comes from the line of Jeff Jeffrey Zekauskas as a follow-up question of JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to follow-up on the question I asked an hour ago. In asking you about TiO2, I think Chris made a throwaway comment where he said, \"Well, I think there's a lot more room for TiO2 prices to fall.\" And I was wondering why you thought that?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, I think we're historians here, Jeff, as you know, and we've been through a number of these titanium runs in the past. I think if some of the earlier questions about the industry moving aggressively to try to find replacement technologies and a lot of that work's just coming to fruition, as we see continuing softness in some of these global markets. As demand continues to remain weak here, history would indicate this commodity will continue to have some softness in pricing. Time will tell. We are just starting the early tipping over points. Now we see the spot market is retracted probably 10 percentage points plus or minus a little bit from the peak, and our expectation would be that in past cycles, that wasn't the end of the pull back, that it would continue from there.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So what caused the tip in that TiO2 demand to stand very, very weak now, for almost a year, and then finally, in the second or at the end of the second quarter, it sort of broke. What caused the break? Or how did the timing work?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think it's all in demand. We talked about the price announcements that were put in by the industry, softening beginning as early as last year about this same time, where they had previously been getting 100% of their announced price increases for the better part of 8, 9, 10 quarters, and then the fourth quarter won about 50% effectiveness similar to first quarter, and we think the industry basically did not take the second quarter announcement at all. So it didn't just break recently, it's been softening now over the past 12 months, as demand has been falling off, and that's all that demand.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any closing comments.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks again, Jesse. Those of you who are still on the call have gone above and beyond the call of duty with an 1 hour and 10 minutes. As usual, we'll be around today and all day tomorrow, to take your follow-up calls. We'd like to thank you once again for joining us today, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

Welcome to The Valspar Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year End Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode, and later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. (Operator Instructions). And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Lori Walker. Please go ahead.", "Lori Walker", "Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and full year earnings conference call. Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, is with me on our call this morning.", "Before we begin, I'll direct your attention to the press release we issued this morning, which contains much of the information that we'll be covering during the call. This call is subject to forward-looking statements language contained in our press release and our comments may include forward-looking statements as that term is defined by securities laws. This morning, I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full year results.", "Details are provided in the press release we issued this morning, which is available in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valsparcorporate.com. Gary will follow with his comments including our outlook for 2013, and then we'll respond to your questions.", "Fourth-quarter sales totaled $1.02 billion, compared to $1.05 billion in 2011. Excluding the negative impact of currency, sales were flat. Adjusted net income per share for the quarter increased to $0.86 in 2012, a 2% increase from $0.84 in 2011. However, last year's net income per share includes non-recurring benefit from favorable tax rulings totaling $0.09. Excluding this benefit, our net income per share increased $0.11, or 15%, and our EBIT margin for the quarter increased to 12.6% from 10.8% last year, a 180-basis point improvement. Our press release includes details showing the reconciliation of our reported to adjusted results.", "For fiscal year 2012, sales totaled $4.02 billion. When adjusted for currency, sales increased roughly 3% from fiscal year 2011. Adjusted net income per share increased 24% to $3.28 in 2012 from $2.65 in 2011. Again, please refer to our press release for the reconciliation to our reported results.", "As I just mentioned, our sales growth for the year was 3%, driven by new business and pricing. However, due to weak international markets and our decision to exit about 2% of our volume from unprofitable customers and product lines, volumes were down 1% for the year. As we began to anniversary some of these decisions, our volume trends have improved. So, in the third and the fourth quarter, volumes were up about 1% and 3%, respectively, driven by our new business wins.", "As I comment on our fourth quarter gross margin and operating expense performance, note that restructuring is excluded in both years, also excluded is last year's non-cash impairment charge for goodwill and intangibles associated with our wood coating and some gelcoat product lines.", "For the fourth quarter, our gross margin was 34%, up 110 basis points from 32.9% in 2011. Margins benefitted from productivity improvements and higher margin new business, particularly in our coatings segment.", "Operating expenses as a rate to revenue were 21.5%, down from 22.1% in the fourth quarter of 2011. Quarter-over-quarter, operating expense dollars decreased $10.8 million, due to benefits from prior restructuring actions, productivity improvements and currency impact.", "Now, I'll shift to a discussion of our tax rate for the quarter and the full year. As a note, the 2011 rate excludes the after-tax non-cash impairment charge. So, the tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2012 was 29.4%, compared with the rate of 16.3% in the fourth quarter last year. Our tax rate for the full year was 29.9%, compared with 26.7% in 2011. The higher tax rate for the quarter and the full year was primarily due to non-recurring benefits from favorable tax rulings in 2011.", "For fiscal 2013, we expect the effective tax rate to be approximately 31% to 32%. The higher projected tax rate for 2013 is due to a non-recurring favorable benefit for a foreign subsidiary realized in the first quarter of 2012. The impact of this benefit was roughly $0.04 in the first quarter.", "Average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter were 93.1 million, a decrease of 2.1 million shares resulting from share repurchases partially offset by option exercises. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.3 million shares for approximately $70 million.", "For the full year, we repurchased 5.7 million shares for $273 million and we have 2.5 million shares remaining under our current authorization. We estimate average shares outstanding for the first quarter to be approximately 93 million.", "Recapping our sales performance in the quarter, volume was up 3%. However, this was offset by the impact of mix in currency resulting in a reported sales growth of negative 2.2%. And, as I discussed our sales performance by segment, the results will be adjusted for currency.", "So, in coating, sales were up 6.3% for the year. Excluding an acquisition we had earlier in the year, sales were up 5.5%. In the quarter, coating sales were up 4.5% with volume growth of 5%. Sales in this segment benefitted from new business in every product line and we were extremely pleased with our volume growth in wood and packaging, which were up 8% and 6%, respectively. These gains more than offset uneven market conditions and our decision last year to exit unprofitable products and customers.", "In our Paint segment sales for the full year were flat. In the fourth quarter, volumes in our North America home improvement channel were up low single digits with strong sell through at retail. In China, we continue to see double-digit volume growth from the successful introduction of initiatives focused on the affordable housing market.", "However, the mixed impact of this product line combined with restructuring and weakness in Australia due to a soft housing market caused sales in this segment to decrease 4% in the quarter. Sales in other, declined 11.6% for the quarter and 2.8% for the full year, primarily due to lower volumes caused by the exit of our gelcoat product line.", "I am now going to move into a discussion of our EBIT margins. When making comparisons to 2011, the numbers I'll be discussing excludes the restructuring charges in both years and the non-cash impairment charge and acquisition related fees from last year.", "For the fourth quarter, our coatings segment EBIT margin was 16.7%, up 120 basis points from 15.5% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The EBIT margin improvement was due primarily to volume growth, including new business at higher average margins, productivity improvements and our exit from a small number of unprofitable product lines and customers.", "Our Paint segment EBIT margin was 11.4%, up 150 basis points from 9.9% in 2011, due to profitability improvement in Australia consumer business, improved productivity and better price to cost balance. The EBIT margin for our other category was negative 20%, compared with negative 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. As a reminder, other includes our corporate expenses.", "So, looking at margins for the full year, our coatings' EBIT margin was 16.4%, up from 13.3% in 2011. The paint segment EBIT margin for the year was 11.1%, up from 9.9% last year. The EBIT margin for other was negative 10.5%, compared with negative 8.9% in 2011. And total company EBIT margin for the year was 12.7%, compared with 10.5% in fiscal 2011. The overall change in company and segment EBIT was due primarily to new business at higher average margins, productivity improvements and better price to cost balance.", "Moving to the balance sheet, our net debt at the end of the year was $878 million, a decrease of $94 million from the end of the third quarter and an increase of $19 million from the end of fiscal 2011.", "For the fourth quarter, operating cash flow was $183 million, compared with $186 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year, we generated $350 million of operating cash flow, compared to $291 million in fiscal year 2011.", "On a full-year basis, we generated $187 million in free cash flow, which we define as operating cash flow less CapEx and dividends. We estimate free cash flow in the range of $185 million to $205 million in fiscal year 2013. Our net debt to capital was 41.8%. We ended our quarter with $767 million of reserved liquidity, and that included $514 million of available committed credit facilities and $253 million in cash.", "Capital spending in the fourth quarter was $28 million, compared with $24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year, capital spending was $89.4 million versus $66.5 million in 2011. Our forecast for 2013 capital spending is approximately $120 million, reflecting our investments in a new manufacturing facility in Tianjin, China and the expansion of our Minneapolis Research and Development Center.", "Depreciation and amortization for the quarter totaled $25.2 million, down from $27.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. Depreciation and amortization for the full year totaled $93.8 million and our full year forecast for 2012 is approximately $90 million.", "As mentioned in our release, we currently expect our fiscal 2013 net income per share to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.85.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Gary for his comments.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Thanks, Lori, and good morning everyone. When we provided our original guidance for fiscal 2012, and we anticipated market conditions would be stable or slightly improving versus 2011 and our new business initiatives would drive our sales growth. We were also projecting mid-single digit increases in raw material inflation.", "Looking back on the year, we were right raw material inflation, but we saw a much more challenging demand environment than we expected with market correction in some international markets. We were pleased that we were able to offset these challenging conditions with significant new business growth, particularly in coatings, and we achieved our new business targets for the year.", "Against this backdrop of a tough global economy and increased raw material costs, Valspar finished fiscal 2012 with record sales, recording operating margins and earnings per share. We delivered a 24% increase in EPS versus last year and this is fourth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. We accomplished this by relentlessly focusing on our customers and our productivity initiatives. I have to say, we are pleased with our operating performance in all respects.", "Once again, we generated a lot of cash during the year. We used this cash to reinvest in our business and to acquire 5.7 million share of the company stock and investment of $273 million. Additionally, we returned $73 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends.", "2012 marks our 34th consecutive year of increased dividend per share, which is a trend that we intend to continue in 2013. Fiscal 2012 was an outstanding year for Valspar and I would like to highlight a few specific areas that stand out.", "In our coating segment, we continued to deliver profitable new business in all of our product lines. W are growing market share in packaging coatings, coil coatings, wood coatings and coatings for pipes, offer equipment and shipping containers.", "Volume growth of more than 5% in our fourth quarter once again demonstrates the strength of our coatings platform. We are also realizing a payback from our prior restructuring actions in this segment, including the planned exit of unprofitable products and customers and this is reflected in the strong EBIT margins of 16.4% in coatings.", "In the Paint segment, the Love Your Color Guarantee program in North America and Australia continues to resonate with consumers creating positive paint sales and volumes in the home improvement channel. We recently announced the extension of this program into 2013.", "Our consumer business in China performed extremely well in 2012. In a market where residential construction was down in double-digits, our business generated positive double-digit volume growth in the year and generated double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the year.", "In Australia and New Zealand, our profit improvement plan is ahead of schedule despite a very challenging market environment. Our partnership with Masters, the Lowe's JV in the region is strong. Masters now has opened 22 stores and has publically recommitted to with 150-store strategy.", "We are also excited about our strategic partnership with B&Q, the largest home center chain in the U.K. and Ireland. As we announced last week, we'll be rolling out the Valspar brand to all 350 B&Q stores throughout 2013. Due to the timing of the upfront investment, this initiative will not have a material impact on our earnings in 2013, but it positions Valspar for growth in the European consumer paint market. B&Q and its parent company, Kingfisher are great partners with deep expertise and understanding of the European home improvement channel.", "Focusing on our customers in delivering coatings, innovation and service have made Valspar an industry leader for the past 206 years. Our results in 2012 reinforce the success and will continue to be the foundation of our plans in 2013. As we look ahead, our EPS guidance for 2013 is $3.65 to $3.85, which once again represents double-digit earnings growth.", "Our assumptions behind that guidance are continuing uneven global demand, but with no significant declines, stable raw material cost, substantial productivity gains and significant new business growth across our product lines.", "So with those comments, Lori and I are happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll go to the line of P.J. Juvekar at Citi. Please go ahead.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Good morning, Gary.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Hey, P.J.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "In the last quarter, you had talked about Wattyl, that the business had stabilized then you were beginning to gain some share or some new business there. Looks like you had some issues in Wattyl this quarter. Can you just explain the moving parts and what's going on with the housing market there?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Sure. Yes. I mean, we had a weak quarter in Wattyl revenue wise, but we had a good year and a good quarter in terms of putting the restructuring plan for that business in place, so the key success factors for Wattyl in Australia, P.J., I would say through the year were met. But, it's a tough residential housing market, and to answer your question about the moving parts there, there are really three moving parts.", "It's a tough residential housing market. That's number one. Second, we haven't fully anniversaried in the quarter, the loss of the Bunnings business that we sustained when we decided to do business with the Lowe's JV in that market. Then, third, as part of the restructuring, we were rationalizing a store count in our Australia business. We're down about 35 stores from when we brought Wattyl two years ago. And that channel, the stores channel is the channel that has the most revenue in the business, so as we rationalized those stores and exited some business, we take a hit on the revenue line, but the profitability of the business actually improved.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned that you'll be rolling out your Valspar paint and 350 B&Q stores, and you got increased costs so there is no bottom line impact in 2013. What could be the impact in 2014 from B&Q?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, I'll just provide a little context P.J. As we mentioned in our release last week, the program will be rolled out to 350 locations in the U.K. and Ireland in 2013. I think, it will be substantially completed in 2013, but this is a multiyear and a multi-phase initiative.", "As you pointed out, 2013 revenue and profit will not be material to 2013 results, and our plan is to continue to update our investors as the phases are rolled out. The most important thing about this is our brand expansion in Europe distributed through the home improvement channel leader.", "At least I think about this the way I think about our initiative in 2007 to launch the Valspar brand in the U.S. We're partnered with a leader, we are partnered with a company that whose parent company owns 1,000 stores throughout Europe, in eight different countries and we view this as the first step to becoming a significant presence in the European paint market.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citi", "Thank you.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Lori Walker", "Morning.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Just following up on that B&Q, they have a thousand stores obviously in several countries. How does that compare to the scale of your exposure in Australia, or maybe the U.S.?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, why don't I reference it to Australia first? I mean, the scale is night and day potentially, Bob, I mean, the European market is a multiple of the Australian market, so I think at B&Q we need to take one step at a time.", "First, 2013 is about success and rolling the program out and establishing the brand in that market and giving consumers the option to buy Valspar paint. We think we are going to execute on that really well.", "The subsequent stages to that are our growth and its growth definitely with B&Q and hopefully with the other parts of the Kingfisher group which if we're successful with that, it will be a significant business.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And, do you have assets in place to produce all that paint or will you have somebody else produce it for you? I guess, you're in the Coating segments over there, but do you have much of a paint asset base in Europe?", "Gary Hendrickson", "At least for 2013, Bob, we are able to supply from our existing asset base. As the program gets larger, there's a possibility that we might need to build a plant to support the business.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And can you tell us the basis for B&Q making this change to whoever their existing supplier might be?", "Gary Hendrickson", "B&Q is looking for a paint company, it's quite simple. They're looking for a paint company that can help them drive growth in their paint department. They did a global review with multiple global branded paint companies. Valspar won that competition so to speak. They thought our consumer proposition was stronger than others that they reviewed. And as you know, we've been running the test for the last year or so and the test was the ultimate determinant as to whether we rolled it out through the rest of the stores. The test went exceedingly well. And as we roll it out through the B&Q network, we think we are going to help them achieve their goal of growing paint department.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And last one if I may. You mentioned, growing your earnings again next year. I think in the past, you discussed incremental margin expansion. Could you give us some sense of what you think the revenue progression looks like into next year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We don't give revenue guidance, Bob. And, as I said in my opening remarks, we would have given you revenue guidance. Last year, we would have missed it, because we didn't expect that we were going to have weak international markets, particularly in Europe and in China. And, so what we can control is that new business that we achieve. And, we always target somewhere between 4% and 5% net new business and that's what we've got built into our plans for next year. Whatever happens with the market happens. We've got no control of that. But in terms of our organic growth, that's what we are looking for.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks, Gary.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. Gary, you've been successful on wood and packaging coatings lately. Can you just describe the drivers of that success and from whom you are taking share from is it just local regional players?", "Gary Hendrickson", "You know, I am not going to say who we are taking share from, David. We try to take the high road on that. But in the packaging coatings business, I think that that most of the players in that segment are global players.", "In wood coatings, you're right. It's more of a regional business, particularly in China. And by the way, our volume growth of 8% was reasonably consistent between our business in China and in North America. So, in the Chinese market it would be regional players. You're right, and the North America market there aren't many regional players. There are multi-national players and so that would be the competitive set that we think that we won against in the quarter.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Gary, just on TiO2. How much were you able to reduce your usage this year in TiO2, and how much more Chinese TiO2 are using across your company?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We set a target of kind of mid single-digits in terms of replacement, David, and we are pretty close to that number. In terms of Chinese substitution, I think, I been pretty public about this number. It's approaching 25%.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays", "Yes. Good morning. Can you walk through kind of your different segments and talk about where you grew faster than the market over the last year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, let me just talk. I'll talk first about coatings, Duffy. For the year, in our Coatings segment our volumes. I've got a cheat sheet here that I'm going to pull out. Let me give you little context to how the year played out for us in terms of our growth. I think that might be helpful.", "We got sequentially stronger in every quarter this year. In Q1, our volumes were down mid-single digits. In Q2, our volumes were down 1%. In Q3, our volumes were up 1%. And, in Q4, our volumes were up 3%. That improvement in Q3, the positive volume growth that we have in Q3 and Q4, includes the dilutive effect of some of the business that we deliberately exited last year.", "So, I think the second half of the year is a better way to answer that question for you than to talk about the first half of the year, because we had a great second half. We had a great second half in packaging, in our GI business and our coil business and in our global wood business.", "And, in our Paint segment, let me talk about the fourth quarter to give a little bit of color on what happened in the fourth quarter. P.J. earlier asked about Wattyl, and some of the negative volume and revenue trends that we are experiencing in Wattyl for the reasons that I mentioned.", "Excluding Wattyl in the quarter, our volumes in our Paint segment would have been up mid-single digits and our revenue in our Paint segment was up mid-single digits, so that's North America and China.", "North America sales were up low single-digits and volumes were up low single digits. And as Lori mentioned in her opening comments, sell-through was much higher than our revenue growth, retail sell-through POS.", "In China, in the fourth quarter, sales were up in the low double digits and volume was up in the mid-teens. The dilutive effect of Wattyl in our Paint segment is the reason that you see our paint revenue and volumes in that segment appear to be weak this quarter.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays", "Okay. Great, and then just if you could go back and triangulate, you had given some guidance on free cash flow, where at the low end, seems like you were basically flat but on EPS at the low end you were up 10% or 11%. Can you just kind of bridge that gap, the difference between your free cash flow forecast and your EPS forecast and where the deviation is?", "Lori Walker", "Duffy, can you ask that question again? We're at the low point from where?", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays", "Well, I think on the free cash flow forecast that you laid out on the low end of your guidance there, you would be about flat year-over-year where on the low end of your EPS guidance for next year, you are still up a little over 10%. So, it seems like we lose a little bit when we get to the free cash flow versus the growth on the EPS, and I was just wondering where that divide comes?", "Lori Walker", "Yes. Well, the biggest place in terms of where the difference is, is the difference in the capital spending, so our capital spending this year was around $90 million and it will be $120 million next year. We have a couple of large projects, the Tianjin plant in China, along with our Minneapolis R&D lab, so that's where the biggest difference is.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays", "Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dmitri Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Good morning, everybody. Excuse me I guess, it's. Yes. It's still good morning. A couple of questions, first of all, you talked about the success that you made in Wattyl on the margin side. Can you tell us where you are on your past two, whatever your ultimate goal in margins for that business is and remind us what that ultimate goal is?", "Gary Hendrickson", "What we publicly said, Dmitri, is that, while we'll have Wattyl operating within five years, so that's we have three years left on this commitment at the company average EBIT margins, so our EBIT margins for the year were 12-plus percent. That's the short-term target.", "Our internal target is for that business and the way we think about our opportunity in that business is higher than that. Right now we are in inning two or inning three of that journey and the EBIT margins are about third of our ultimate goal, about 50% of our five-year goal.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "50% of the five-year goal? Okay. And if you go back to the business loss that you sustained in the big box channel in Australia, you said there were still some of that impact in the fourth quarter of this year. Is that going to be fully anniversaried as we get into 2013?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. It will be. Fourth quarter was the full anniversary of it.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. Then can you remind us?", "Lori Walker", "Dmitri, just to let you know though what hasn't anniversary yet is exiting from the stores, so that will actually impact us through the first half of next year.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Got it, and that was actually my next question. What's right now as it stands with 22 stores that you have in Masters versus your company-owned stores, and what's the mix of revenues between your sort of company-controlled stores and the mass merchants' channel?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Company-controlled stores are about two-thirds of the revenue in that business, Dmitri.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, so two-thirds of company-controlled. Okay. Great. Finally, you talked about the new U.K. business that you are picking up not going to have much of earnings impact in 2013, although I imagine there will be a little bit of a volume impact from the channel fill just not at a very high margin is the way I understand it, but is that correct?", "Gary Hendrickson", "That's correct.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. On the Chinese Huarun business as well as your initiative, you talked about the Chinese paint business benefitting from sort of the affordable housing trend, but I remember you about a year ago or so getting Valspar paint into the more of trophy properties in the high end market. Is that initiative still alive and well and as you look back on it for 2012 and you look forward in 2013, any success stories or any changes that you would make going forward that you would like to share?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Right now, it's alive and well. We've got new distribution, we've done a number of projects. I would say the business is on track with the plan that we had. Remember we tried to downplay that. We're going into Tier-1 cities with the Valspar brand and we've operated historically in Tier-2 and 3 cities. So, this is still a minor program for us in the context of overall Huarun and we view it as a long-term opportunity and not a short-term opportunity.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Got it, and then final question on your raw material expectations for next year. For 2012, you expected to be sort of a mid-single digit, high-single digit raw materials, but I think it turned out to be more towards the mid-single digit level. I think you said, you expected flattish raw materials for 2013, if I remember your comments correctly?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Correct.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. And, is that just an all-in basket being flat and you expect some movements within that, whether in the pigment side or the resin side or packaging or anything like that? Are you just expecting generally flattish raw material environment across the board?", "Gary Hendrickson", "When we make those comments, Dmitri, we are talking about our total basket. So, there'll be movement up and down on specific items that we buy, but the overall basket we expect at this point in time, they are expected to be flattish.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Very good. And then final question, the restructuring that you've done in the wood coatings business, obviously, improved the profitability of that business but you're also now enjoying some volume growth there.", "Is that sort of the pent up furniture demand being driven by the housing market in the U.S. or is it market share gains or new products. Can you talk about what's behind the fairly strong volume growth we've seen in the wood coatings business after several years of less than stellar performance there?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. I mean, we've had two quarters now of pretty solid volume growth in that business. Some of it is the market recovery, not so much furniture by the way, Dmitri. We don't do much furniture business anymore, most of the furniture industry has moved to Asia. But in North America, it's building products, and kitchen cabinetry and other segments of the market that have shown some signs of recovery and we also have taken some market share.", "So, of the growth that we had and volume growth that we had in the quarter of 8%, I'm just going to take a stab at it and say 4% was volume growth and 4% was market share.", "Dmitri Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Got it. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "Good morning. It's Silke Kueck for Jeff. How are you?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Good, Silke.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "When I look at the Paints business, the sales year-over-year were down, and the profitability was up quite significantly. How much of that was a raw material benefit versus restructuring savings?", "Gary Hendrickson", "About, a significant part of it was the restructuring that we've done in the Australia business and the improvement that we've made in that business that we've talked about a couple of times so far in the call. Part of it is productivity that we've had in that segment generally and the remainder of it is a better price cost balance in that segment, and it's about a third, of third, of third.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "Okay. My memory is, is that when you purchased the Wattyl business it was about like $500 million in sales. With the loss of the Bunnings business and shutting down 35 stores, how many stores are left and how large is the business now?", "Gary Hendrickson", "It was about $400 million when we bought it, Silke, not $500 million, and/or that we have about roughly 90 stores left, I mean Lori or Tyler can give you the exact number later, but it's about 90. We're down about 35 and the revenue this year was 350?", "Lori Walker", "Yes. A little bit more than that. About 360.", "Gary Hendrickson", "360. So, revenues down $40 million in the two years that we've owned it through the loss of and we've been transparent of that the Bunnings business was about $30 million in business, and the stores that we exited obviously make up the balance of that and there's been some price in the market that's supported revenue so.", "But, the point about Wattyl is, sure we loss the Bunnings business. The trade for that was 70% of shelf space at Masters. Masters now has 22 stores open, they have committed to their 150 store strategy. Those stores are selling a lot more paint than we expected. They've been very successful in the paint department. That's the growth platform for us in the retail sector.", "In our trade sector, which is the stores business, we had to make some cuts. We bought a business that had many, many stores that were unprofitable and we've taken the actions that were appropriate, our top line has been impacted by that but our bottom line is improving as I just said in the previous question I had answered for you.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "Yes. I apologize, I did not mean to complain. I just tried to get what would be.", "Gary Hendrickson", "I didn't take it as complaining you just gave me an opportunity to talk more about the business, so thanks for that.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "Okay. How are prices generally holding up in the paints business and in the coatings business?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We've done a nice job through the year of getting price cost about right, but we still have raw material costs today that are higher than they were last year. So, we're not in a position to be giving price back and that's the nature of the conversation that we are having with our customers, so we are in reasonable shape relative to price and cost.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "And, lastly I was wondering how you went about winning the B&Q business. Was it that the retailer wanted a new paint brand or they wanted in-situ tinting or how did that occur?", "Gary Hendrickson", "This is the question that I answered earlier for Bob.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "Yes.", "Gary Hendrickson", "It was the competition and the customer asked a number of global paint companies to help them with their challenge to grow the paint department faster than it was growing at that time, and so it was a combination what ultimately won it for us was a combination of our success with the brand in the U.S. and I think B&Q's confidence that we can do the same thing in the U.K. market.", "So, it was brand. It is a tinted system, tinted program, most of the paint in the U.K. is ready mix not tinted. So, the insight that, we and B&Q have together is that, we believe that if you give consumers more color choice then you've tapped into a consumer need and that's what's going to drive the sales.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "And, will you need to build any manufacturing assets in the region to support that business, asset growth or, I mean, I know this has been asked before like in some form as well. I was just sort of curious, like you know because over time of the 350 stores, I don't know what your sell-through is, whether it's $300,000 per store, $200,000 or $500,000. It can become sizeable, so will you need to put capacities or will you need to build capacities in Europe at some point?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. Eventually we will, but not in 2013. We've got a substantial business in Europe already with a number of manufacturing plants. There are a number of supply chain options that we have, Silke, that will exhaust before we make the investment in a manufacturing plant. And by the way, if we do, we're not talking about $100 million. We are probably talking about $20 million or $25 million.", "Silke Kueck - JPMorgan ", "Okay. Thanks so much. I'll go back to queue.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to line of John McNulty at Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of things, first of all, we've seen M&A picking up in the space. And, I guess, I'm wondering are you starting to see opportunities that might be interesting to you, or is that something that maybe gets put on the back burner now that you've got this B&Q opportunity and the growth around that? How should we think about that going forward?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Absolutely not going on the back burner, John. I mean, we haven't talked a lot about our consumer team in Europe, but we've got a great consumer team in Europe and that will handle the B&Q deal.", "For B&Q, for us this is what we do. It's additive in the sense that it's a new initiative for us, but this is what we do and we've been in the U.K. market for a long time with our spray paint business and so we know B&Q well, we know the market well, we do business with a lot of retailers in the U.K. through our spray paint business and we've got a great team and they'll just pick up and run with the B&Q initiative. So, this in no way shape or form will let slow us down.", "I would say that the market has picked up a little bit and there are a number of opportunities that we are pursuing. I won't say any are eminent, but I would expect that during this year, you'll see Valspar do a deal or two.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great. And then with regard to your China business, can you just walk us through what you're seeing in the China housing market and if you're starting to see signs of kind of a recovery of pickup there. I know you've had a lot of strength with your affordable housing platform picking up, but are you seeing the actual kind of China market itself starting to improve yet?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I wouldn't say that John. I would say it plateaued or let's say bottomed probably in second or third quarter, and it's pretty much ran along at that bottom since then. So, we haven't seen any significant change.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And then just the last question, in terms of your affordable housing platform can give us any color? I think earlier in the call you had spoken or Lori had spoken about some mix effect. I guess, could you give us some color as to how we should think about the profit difference or the price difference on the paint for your affordable housing platform versus your more traditional Huarun platform?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Sure. It has a significant mix impact and in fact we decided not to talk about it relative to our paint segment revenue results, because it's a complicated topic. But, here's the bottom line, we grew our volume in Huarun in the mid-teens and our revenue grew in around 10%, so a pretty significant mix impact in that business and has effect on the overall paint segment as well.", "Here's the deal on it though, you saw that we improved our segment margins. The reason for that is that this product, while it does have a gross margin that's slightly lower than the average margin in Huarun business, it doesn't attract anywhere near the expense to support it that the Huarun business, because we're not doing a lot of company advertising for it. We're doing some. Because it goes through the non-exclusive distribution, we've got about 3,000 or 4,000 points of distribution that are non-Huarun stores. Those retailers have the responsibility to do the advertising for it to the extent that would they like to.", "So, net-net, we've got reasonable gross margins on it, very little expenses. So, it's at least as profitable if not more profitable than the core Huarun business.", "John McNulty - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Great, and thanks very much for the color.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to line of Ivan Marcuse at KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. On the B&Q business over in U.K. and Ireland, is the market similar to the U.S. where sort of split between DIY and contractor and what sort of sales per store in the DIY on the paint basis, is that about the same as it is in the U.S. or is it different dynamics, so could you just talk about the market a little bit?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. So, this is a DIY program for us, Ivan. We're not going after the contractor market.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "No. I mean, like in a total market, how in U.S., it's generally like half of it is into the contractor market like stores and the other half of the total volume is maybe into the DIY. That's what?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. I think, more or less the same and more or less the same in the distribution channel to the pro, right. DIYs are through similar channels to here there are two big home improvement chains in the U.K. market, B&Q happens to be the leader, so we're linked up with the leader. That's primarily a DIY business. Then there are other distribution channels to the pro.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "Got it, so very similar dynamics, I guess, bottom line?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "Got you. And then, your partner in the U.S. talked about how they were doing line reviews and to sort of reducing inventories and figuring out what they are going to do. I know that your volumes were up this quarter, but in the previous quarters there were some inventory fluctuations you had to deal with. So, now with them it seems like your inventories are down. Would you expect going into the late winter, early spring may be an acceleration of orders beyond the typical seasonal uptick with that partner?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No. In fact, they did a good job of managing their inventories in this quarter as well. They are down, yes. As I mentioned, we had a low-single digit volume growth in the U.S., but the paint sell-through in all channels were stronger than the volume growth and so that's part of that is our partner doing a very nice job of meeting their inventory objectives.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "Great. And then was most of the restructuring this quarter was that all related to Australia or is that still some from the wood business that you were doing?", "Lori Walker", "It's mainly due to Australia.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "And will there be more of that next year?", "Lori Walker", "No. Not material.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "Got you, and then what were raw materials, the total basket up for the quarter?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Sequentially, they were flattish.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc", "Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research ", "Hi, guys. Could you comment on some of the newer products that you have? The shipping containers, pipe coatings, [type] coatings, and give us a sense for how those are doing and also what the pipeline is for new products that might be coming out shortly?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Sure. So, our pipe business had a great year this year and we are expecting a great year for them again next year, because pipelines are being built all over the world. Our shipping container business had a great year in the context of making conversions of lines from the conventional coatings to our Aquaguard coatings this year. We have now converted six lines.", "The only problem with that business, Kevin, is that nobody is making shipping containers these days, because global trade is pretty weak and so there are more containers available than there normally would be, so the shipping companies are not ordering containers and the container companies are not ordering containers, so the market is weak. The industry expects that market to remain weak into the second half of next year and that's the nature of the shipping businesses. It goes through a lot of peaks and valleys.", "In terms of the off-road segment, we've got an awful lot of new customer qualifications. We've got a very nice pipeline of business. I'll say that that's a relatively market as well. It's one of the ones that I referred to when I talked about market contraction in some of our end markets this year. I mean, I think you've probably seen the announcement from some of our customers that they have cut back production pretty substantially and that's true also those are the global company. That's true also for the companies that we do business with in China.", "So, the net of all that commentary is, that we've opened up, we have a much larger book of business today than we did at the start of the year. And, the pipe coatings business remains on track and growing, and the market is strong. Pipe and off-road markets are a bit weak globally.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research ", "Okay. And, in terms or the Masters stores, I think you said there's 22 stores now. They are committed to bringing on 150. How many do you think will be on line by the end of 2013?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I don't know, but it's probably 10 or 15 more. That's my guess. That's not inside information. I don't know, but I'm guessing.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research ", "Okay. And then finally, you talked about raws being flattish, kind of the outlook for 2013. How is that looking sequentially going into the first quarter? It looks like TiO2 has been coming down, polypropylene has kind of stayed lower, so just kind of wondered what does that look like sequentially just moving into the first quarter?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We are thinking it's going to be flat for the whole year, including the first quarter.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research ", "Okay. Great. All right. Thank you very much.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thank you for taking my question. Gary, you have improved the EBIT margin by 210 basis points this year or thereabout. How much more do you think you can, and this by the way is the highest EBIT margin since 2010 at least as far as the numbers I am looking at, how much more do you think you can improve it?", "I know that as a general rule, you are not pushing so much for the gross margin expansion as you don't want your customers to be discouraged and that you are taking it out of operating expenses, but how much more can you take out?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Thanks for recognizing that it was up substantially this year, Rosemarie. I'll just point out though in context that we took a dip in 2011 from 2010, right? Last year was a year when we had massive raw material inflation and we were chasing that inflation all year long. So, what we've done this year is, restored the business to the margin rate that it should be running at, so I think that context is important.", "In terms of going forward, we have expectations that we should be able to improve the company's margins through growth and through productively. You're right, I mean, the customers that we have today expect us to manage those things and what we expect that we'll do over time as we get more productive is, grow our business and share some of that with our customers.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "But that is at the gross margin level, I was looking at the operating margin. How much more can you take out of G&A?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No. I'm talking about operating margin. When we talk about productivity at Valspar, Rosemarie, we talk about the entire P&L. We don't focus just on one part of it.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Just following up on that, as you are still benefiting from some of the productivity actions that you took this year, how likely is it that next year you can still improve by about 100 basis points let's say?", "Gary Hendrickson", "That's a big number.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Right. Okay.", "Gary Hendrickson", "That's not our plan.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "All right. Okay. That is helpful. When looking at B&Q you also made a point in saying that it would not benefit to the bottom line, because of the nature of the investment. Could it have a negative impact on your operating income for a short period of time as you are ramping up?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Possibly, but it won't be material.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And then two more questions, if I may. Australia has been weak now for quite a while. Are you seeing any change in the trend?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Not really. I mean, I know the government is doing what they can to stimulate the housing market. They have lowered interest rates pretty substantially and they are doing the things that you would expect the government to do and there is a very weak market, but no signs of life yet.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "You also said that in 2013 you expected to make an M&A deal. Is it more likely to be some kind of bolt-on type of acquisition either entering in your geography or adding technologies that you don't currently have or are you still contemplating a larger one?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No. We don't have any plans for what you would probably consider large ones. We are looking in the paints industry. And, all other things that you mentioned geography, technology, line extensions, et cetera, those are all in play for us as we contemplate what the types of companies that we would like to acquire.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Thanks. And, my last question is for Lori. Although she maybe not here, good luck Lori on your new project. You had announced that you expected to lower the net number of shares by about 2 million on an annualized basis taking into considerations whatever options may add. Is that number still a good number to look at 2 million shares by year end versus beginning of the year?", "Lori Walker", "Right, so what our policy is that we will guarantee that we will offset dilution and the intent is over the longer term to reduce the share count by 2% and this year was actually closer to the 3%.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Steve Schwartz with First Analysis.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Lori, I think in your commentary about EBIT margin for paint, you mentioned a favorable price cost spread, so it sounds like from your various answers this morning that pricing was positive. You had continued gains in the fourth quarter while raw materials maybe were up less. Is that correct?", "Lori Walker", "Correct.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. And, so then just to bring in, into the bigger picture, when we look at negative numbers in a price mix category on the spreadsheets we use, it sounds like that's mostly mix related to China and so forth and maybe Australia as well.", "Lori Walker", "Correct.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. And then on Wattyl, because it's Southern Hemisphere, if you could remind us a weak performance in the fourth quarter of your year, is that essentially their spring? Does that portend that the next couple of quarters will probably be weak?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I wouldn't expect any significant change, so we anniversary Bunnings, Steve, so that we are up a little bit. The Masters stores, Masters will continue building stores, that helps, but the rest of it has to do with the market recovery. And, until the market recovers, I wouldn't expect to see any substantial revenue improvement from Wattyl with the exception of the things that I just mentioned.", "Steve Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. That Sounds good. Thanks for taking the question.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks. Gary, I was just curious, it seems like maybe the Chinese housing market, there's some light somewhere in the tunnel. During this bleaker period I know you guys have done well by focusing on the inland cities versus maybe Dulux and Nippon which are in the bigger coastal cities. Have you seen any change in the competitive dynamic as the market went through this volatility in the last 18 months?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I'm not sure that it had anything to do with the market volatility, Bob, but the competitors that you just mentioned have publicly talked about their Tier-2 and Tier-3 strategies, which is where our strength is.", "So, I would say the answer is yes. It has gotten a little bit more competitive, but it's a big market. The three of us together still represent less than 10% of the total market, so there's a lot of room for all of us to grow.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thank you.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions in queue.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Okay. Well, thanks everyone for joining us on our call today. Once again just to recap, we are issuing our guidance for fiscal year 2013 of $3.65 to $3.85, and we look forward to updating you on our first quarter conference call in February.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's Review of Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Results and Expectations for 2013. With us on today's call are Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO; Sean Hennessy, Senior Vice President Finance and CFO; Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications.", "This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Vcall via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call ends and will be available until Thursday, February 21, 2013, at   5 p.m. Eastern time.", "This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone. In order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations 2012 Year-end Press Release.", "Summarizing overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2012, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.3% to $2.22 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume to our Paint Stores Group and selling price increases.", "For the full year, sales increased 8.8%, to $9.53 billion. Sales from acquisitions increased consolidated net sales approximately 0.9% in the quarter and year.", "Currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales 1% in the quarter and 1.8% for the year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 45.5% of sales from 42.8% of sales in the fourth quarter 2011.", "For the year, gross margin increased to 44.3% of sales from 42.7% last year. The increase in gross margin for the quarter and year was due primarily to higher selling prices and the positive effect of higher production volumes, partially offset by higher year-over-year raw material costs. Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars increased $74 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, an increase as a percent of sales to 37.3% from 36.4% in the same quarter last dollars but decreased as a percent of sales to 33.5% from 33.8% in 2011. Incremental SG&A from acquisitions, new stores and customer service investments accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year.", "Impairment charges for the planned conversion of various trademarks totaled $4.1 million in the fourth quarter and full year 2012, compared to $5.5 million in 2011.", "Interest expense for the quarter increased $2.2 million, to $11.9 million. For the year, interest expense was $42.8 million, compared with $42.5 million in 2011.", "Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2012 decreased to 32.7% from 88.8% in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "As a reminder, fourth quarter last year income tax expense included a onetime after-tax charge of approximately $75 million to satisfy our settlement with the IRS.", "For the year, our effective tax rate was 31.1% in 2012, compared to 40.4% in 2011. Excluding the IRS settlement, our full year 2011 effective tax rate would have been 30.3%.", "Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $102.7 million, to $117.2 million. For the year, net income increased $238.3 million, to $680.2 million. Net income, as a percent of sales in the quarter, increased to 5.3% from 0.7% last year. For the year, net income, as a percent of sales, increased to 7.1% from 5% in 2011.", "Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2012 increased to $1.12 from $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter 2011. For the year, diluted net income per common share increased 56.8%, to $6.49 per share from $4.14 per share in 2011.", "Now I'd like to review our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2012 increased 9.8%, to $1.25 billion. For the year, net sales increased 13.2%, to $5.41 billion. Sales increases in the quarter and year resulted primarily from higher paint sales volumes across all customer segments and slightly higher year-over-year selling prices.", "Comparable store sales increased 9.2% in the quarter and 12.5% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions, followed by Southeast division, Midwest division and Eastern Division. All 4 Paint Stores divisions recorded positive sales in the fourth quarter.", "Segment operating profit for the Paint Stores Group increased 36.1%, to $181.5 million from $133.4 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the full year, Paint Stores Group operating profit increased 33.5%, to $861.8 million from $645.7 million in 2011. The increase in segment profit for the quarter and year resulted from higher paint sales volumes and selling price increases that were partially offset by higher raw material costs and SG&A expense.", "Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter -- operating profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 14.6% from 11.8% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2012 increased to 15.9% from 13.5% in 2011.", "Turning now to Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 1.4% to $255.8 million, due primarily to acquisitions, partially offset by lower sales volumes to most of the group's larger retail customers.", "For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 3.7%, to $1.32 billion from $1.27 billion in 2011, as a result of higher selling prices and acquisitions.", "Acquisitions increased net sales by 6.5% in the quarter and 3.2% in the year. Segment operating profit for the fourth quarter decreased to $23.3 million from $30.2 million last year, due primarily to a more normal seasonal reduction in our internal finished goods inventory compared to fourth quarter last year and to higher raw material costs that were partially offset by selling price increases.", "For the year, segment operating profit increased 24.6%, to $216.4 million from $173.7 million in 2011, due primarily to selling price increases and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by higher raw material cost.", "As a percent of net sales, Consumer Group's operating profit in the fourth quarter decreased to 9.1% from 12% last year. For the year, operating margin increased to 16.4% from 13.6% in 2011.", "For our Global Finishes Group, net sales in the fourth quarter increased 5.1%, to $487.1 million, due primarily to higher sales volumes and selling price increases, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.", "For the year, Global Finishes Group sales increased 4.4%, to $1.96 billion, due primarily to selling price increases, higher sales volumes and acquisitions partially offset by unfavorable currency.", "Acquisitions increased the group sales in the U.S. -- in U.S. dollars by 1.8% in the year. Currency translations decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 1.4% in the quarter and decreased sales by 3.5% in the year.", "Global Finishes Group segment operating profit for the fourth quarter increased to $34.1 million from $13 million last year. For the year, segment operating profit increased to $147.2 million from $90.3 million last year.", "In the quarter and year, higher selling prices, volume growth and good expense control more than offset raw material cost inflation. Unfavorable currency translation and acquisitions reduced segment profit $3.4 million in the quarter and $11.9 million in the year.", "As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group operating profit was 7% in the fourth quarter, compared to 2.8% last year, and 7.5% for the year compared to 4.8% in 2011.", "For our Latin American Coatings Group, net sales increased 5.2%, to $231.5 million in the quarter, and increased 0.9%, to $836.1 million for the full year, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices and increased sales volume, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.", "Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 6.7% in the quarter and 10.2% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin American Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter increased 14.3%, to $30.1 million. For the year, segment profit increased 7.6%, to $81.2 million.", "In both the quarter and year, segment profit improvement resulted primarily from price increases and higher sales volume, partially offset by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation.", "Currency translation decreased segment profit $2 million in the quarter and decreased profit $9.7 million in the year.", "As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 13% in the fourth quarter, compared to 12% last year, and 9.7% for the year, compared to 9.1% in 2011.", "I'll conclude this review with a brief update on the status of our lead litigation. The Santa Clara case, involving claims of public nuisance brought by 10 cities and counties in California against 5 defendant companies, continues to move forward. At a recent pretrial hearing, the judge presiding over the case set a trial date of June 29, 2013, to allow the parties more time to complete the discovery process and file this positive pretrial motion.", "That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2012. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2013. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, Bob, good morning, everybody thanks for joining us today. 2012 was a year of many milestones for Sherwin-Williams. For the year, we set all-time high watermarks for consolidated sales, net income, earnings per share and net operating cash. We also reported record sales and earnings per share in each of the 4 quarters during the year. And 3 of our 4 reportable segments established all-time peaks in sales and segment profit this past year.", "Additionally, our Paint Stores Group eclipsed the 3,500 store mark, and we recruited more than 1,000 college graduates into our management-training program, both all-time highs.", "Finally, late in the year, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire Comex. Once this since transaction is completed, it will be the largest acquisition in our company's history.", "These milestones and others we celebrated in 2012 were the direct result of our decision to stay the course, to stick with our strategy when market conditions collapsed back in 2008 and 2009. Since that time, we have continued to invest in new distribution and new product technology. We continue to invest in quality and productivity initiatives across our supply chain. We continue to recruit right motivated men and women into our management-training programs and prepare them for leadership assignments.", "We believe the effects of these investments are cumulative and the outcomes we achieved this past year are repeatable. It's pretty obvious, based on our SG&A spending in 2012 and particularly in the fourth quarter, that the pace of these investments actually increased throughout the year.", "While the higher SG&A did dampen earnings, we believe the timing of these investments couldn't be better. Most of the $235 million increase in SG&A for the year fell into 1 of 3 of buckets. The largest was our investment in new stores, including new sales and customer service employees, which accounted for more than half of the overall SG&A increase.", "The second bucket was incentive compensation, which was higher this year, as our selling organization and field management shared in the benefits of their record results.", "The smallest bucket was acquisitions and infrastructure investment, including IT. If you believed that 2012 marked the beginning of a sustainable recovery in many of our end markets, now is the ideal time to build sales and customer service capacity, which is precisely what we did.", "In 2012, our Paint Stores Group added 70 net new stores, bringing our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,520, compared to 3,450 locations 1 year ago. Our plan for 2013 calls for new store openings in the range of 70 to 80 locations.", "We also hired a 1,140 new sales and customer service employees to bolster our store staffing and improve our territory coverage. Our Latin American Coatings Group added 11 net new stores during the year, for a total now of 276 locations throughout the region.", "These investments in new stores, store staff and rep coverage pay for themselves in a very short period of time. Consistent investment relies on strong, dependable cash generation. Again, in 2012, our net operating cash increased $152 million, to $888 million, or about 9.3% of sales.", "If you add back the cash settlement paid to the IRS that Bob mentioned earlier in the first quarter of this year, cash from operations for the year approached 10% of net sales, our long-term objective.", "A portion of this increase came from our continued progress in working capital management. Our working capital ratio declined to 10.8% of sales at year-end from 10.9% of sales at the end of 2011.", "In anticipation of closing the Comex acquisition in the first half of 2013, in December, we placed $1 billion of new debt in 5- and 30-year maturities at a blended average rate of 2.1%.", "As a result, we finished the year with an uncharacteristically high cash balance of $863 million. During the fourth quarter, we acquired 800,000 shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 4.6 million shares at an average cost of $121.25 per share and a total investment of $558 million for the year.", "At year-end, we had remaining authorization to acquire another 16.5 million shares. Over the past year, we returned $161 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2012 marked our 34th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue.", "This year, at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, I will recommend approval of a payout rate for 2013 consistent with our policy of 30% at prior year's earnings per share.", "I'll close my comments this morning by highlighting yet one more all-time record of guidance for 2013. Our full year guidance calls for diluted earnings per share in the range of $7.35 to $7.55 per share, a 15.6% increase at the midpoint on mid-single-digit sales growth.", "For the first quarter, we're earnings per share in a range of $1.03 to $1.13, a 13.7% increase at midrange on top of a strong first quarter in 2012, and we'll accomplish that on low-single-digit sales growth. Neither of these ranges include any earnings contributions from the Comex acquisition, but do include the approximately $21 million of additional interest expense on the incremental debt.", "While some members on The Street are above these ranges, this constitutes the largest increase in full year earnings guidance in both dollars and percentage terms in our company's history.", "While our expectation for top line growth may appear modest, it will come almost entirely from volume. Nearly all of the impact from our previous price increases have annualized and our guidance this year anticipates very little incremental pricing.", "We begin each year with some level of uncertainty, and 2013 is no exception. Despite the steadily improving health of many of our end markets and the positive trends, we've seen in the cost of certain commodities, we remain cautious. Market demand and volume recovery has been erratic across geographies and end markets, and we expect that will continue. Currency translation is also likely to remain a headwind to sales and earnings throughout the year, particularly in our Latin American markets. Our raw material basket has many moving parts as well. But in total, it remains biased towards inflation.", "While we have seen some easing in titanium pricing over the back half of 2012, propylene, the key raw material feedstock, has increased 30%, from $0.55 per pound last quarter to $0.72 per pound today. This will keep some upward pressure on the price of monomers and latex in the first half of 2013.", "Based upon our assumptions and improving price stability in titanium and increased volatility in propylene, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation to be in the low single-digit range in 2013. Our visibility in each of these areas improved significantly as we go through the year. And as always, we'll adjust our expectations accordingly.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now the team would be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Can you give us a sense as to what your full year '13 guidance assumes for U.S. paint gallons for the industry? And if you could, of course, take it one step further in terms of expectations for existing and new home sales?", "Robert J. Wells", "Well, clearly, we're most optimistic about U.S. architectural market. And we do believe that residential will probably be the strongest driver in that market again. But just as a reminder to everyone on the call, U.S. architectural gallons typically grow at a rate in the range of GDP. And even in a recovery year, if you consider 1.5x to 2x that rate, you're still in the, probably, 3% to 4% range for U.S. architectural volume.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And this is Sean Hennessy. And on top of that, when you talk about this gallonage, when you start looking at this guidance, again, last year, when you look -- and we will just talk about stores. Stores for the year, the selling price was up single -- mid-single digits. This year, we really have very slight pricing in our guidance this year. So we're going up against that pricing that we had last year. And so the sales are really more indicative of higher percentage of unit growth.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then switching to global finishes. Were volumes for the quarter in line with the expectations? It seemed to be a little bit stronger than 4Q '11. And if you can parse out the various verticals, how they performed during the quarter.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Actually, global finishes, when we take a look at the quarter, performed very close to what we had expected. And I will tell you that the sales were in the high end of the range. It really was because of stores being a little bit stronger than what we've thought. As far as the 3 segments, I'm not prepared -- I don't have -- when you look at the automotive and so forth, we're not prepared to go through that.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "There has been significant M&A in Paints. With your Comex deal, PPG acquiring Akzo's U.S. business. Do you expect that pace to continue? And what does it mean for margins in the industry if you remove some of these underperforming businesses?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, obviously, we don't expect that Paints like that to continue. Those were 2 extremely large deals in our industry and the universe of property of that size and scale are diminishing. So as we have commented for many years, P.J., from our M&A strategy, there's an awful lot of small bolt-on, both technologies and controlled distribution plays. So I think that's more will likely what you'll see going forward. I don't know that these 2 deals will have a significant impact on margin. The bigger issue on margins, in our industry, as we've shared with the investment communities, has been the impact of raw material cost pressures and the ability to pass those along over a period of time. And I think those dynamics will continue to play out pretty much unchanged, regardless of these potential acquisitions that may or may not close.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And the other thing, P.J. This is, again, Sean Hennessy. When you speak of operating margins, I would say that a lot of this, the infrastructure, the admin costs, the percent of sales, those are the things that you're going to see up -- are going to see operating margin from us expand from these, but more from infrastructure and those type of SG&A efficiencies.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And secondly, you mentioned there was normal inventory decline in the consumer group. Was there a destocking by your channel partner that's now behind us? And do you see a rebound in 2013?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think this is actually, we try to use the word internal. And if you -- and I'm just going to go back a year. If remember in the third quarter of 2011, we did bring the inventory in line. And the reason we did that is in the first half of the year in 2011, we are coming -- we're anniversarying the shortages in some of, some products that we needed and we overspent in 2010. So we allowed the inventory to build in 2011. In third quarter, we allowed that inventory to drop, which depressed Consumer Group's operating margin. And what we said at that time is this was a little abnormal for us in the fourth quarter when you look at the year. So if you look at the third quarter 2011 in Consumer, the operating margin was depressed. The fourth quarter was a little higher than normal. And now we're anniversarying those situations. So it's internal inventory. Our inventory remains fairly flat in the third quarter in Consumer, and then it dropped in the fourth quarter, which is more normal for our sales curve and in our history of our company. So this year, the third quarter operating margins for Consumer was very strong. This year, the fourth quarter was depressed. And for the full year, the consumer group had really nice operating margins. Next year, I don't expect that third and fourth quarter adjustment to occur again. So it will be more normalized next year.", "Operator", "The next question comes from line of Chris Nocella of RBC.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe can you break your sales growth guidance directionally, at least, between the segments for 2013?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think that if you take a look at it, we prefer not to do that. I mean, we really don't do that. But I think what you can probably tell is we're -- Store Group, with the unit volume, will probably be the strongest.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just for 2012, what's your best guess in how that volume through the stores was split between new build and repaint?", "Robert J. Wells", "I'd say it was probably very consistent, Chris, with the kind of the overall market environment. We have said that, for a long period of time, that the new construction market would account for somewhere in the 20% to 25% demand for architectural coatings. That was probably a little depressed from that number because we still have not seen the kind of rebound, both in housing, as well as commercial start. So -- let's assume in the high teens was the amount of the gallons that were used for new construction. The remainder would have been for maintenance and redecorating.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions, one just a clarification on volumes. Of the 12.5% same-store sales growth in Paint Store Sales Group this year, were you saying that half was price, half was volume?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, more than half, but very close, because of that mid-single-digit.", "Robert J. Wells", "More than half of volume, Don.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "So are you forecasting volumes to be relatively flat. Is that what's implied in your -- or that the growth will be equivalent in 2013 to 2012 in terms of your volume level for Paint Stores Group?", "Robert J. Wells", "When you say volume flat, flat for 2012?", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "No, I meant growth rate the same, flat growth rate, yes.", "Robert J. Wells", "Right.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "And then one additional question, Chris, did I hear you say you expect TiO2 to stabilize this year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Don, we would expect TiO2 pricing to be more stable in 2013 that we've seen over the past few years.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then just final question. I know you have some tough comps in first quarter. So I was a little surprised that you're still expecting some low-single-digit growth. Is that maybe you can  just give us some more background on why you think you're going to get growth over such tough comp?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think Bob commented that we really have confidence in particularly the North American residential repaint market. And we have been accelerating in that space. We've been seeing the return of the painting contractor do a higher percentage of the purchase of architectural coatings throughout the year, and those trend lines are continuing. So despite the fact that we got a pretty high hurdle on the jump, we're giving the kind of guidance from the clarity that we can see in the quarter and we expect to be able to hit these numbers.", "Operator", "The next question comes from line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chris, I appreciate the disaggregation of SG&A that you've provided. If we put the Comex deal on the side for a moment, do you think that the uplift in 2013 on the SG&A line will be similar to what you experienced in 2012? Perhaps you could comment on a forward-looking basis on some of the 3 buckets that you mentioned there and what that looks like for this year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So if you look at SG&A for the year, it actually was down as a percent of sales. So the fourth quarter had a little bit of acceleration. Overall, it was a kind of discipline that we could bring to managing that part that I think was at play throughout the year. We did comment about the decision to continue to heavy-up. I think we began the year with a little lower store count expectation and kind of accelerated to get to that 70 store in the fourth quarter. 40 of our 70 stores actually came in the fourth quarter this year in terms of their openings. So we were a little late-in-the-year heavy-handed in that particular area. And that's been pretty typical for the way that the stores flow in for us in past years, as well. In our expectations for next year, that SG&A will continue to improve as a percent of sales. We're going to continue to make these investments. We'll put in more stores next year than this year as we guided. So I think that it's been a pretty consistent track record here and it should continue again into 2013.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And second question, I think in the past you've commented a bit on your efforts to minimize the amount of TIO2 required as a company to the extent that, that makes sense through reformulation efforts in certain cases. Can you provide an update on that? Is it ongoing? Is there -- where do you stand now? Is there more to take out in 2013?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think we have commented, Kevin, along with a number of other of our global coatings competitors, who are also purchasers of this material, that there are a lot of activities under way to try to eliminate the amount of titanium load neither in a typical gallon of paint. We have talked about the ability to make those conversions to lower grades. We have titanium, particularly outside the North America, and those activities are at play as well. And I think the numbers that you hear, that perhaps 5% to -- as much as 10% of this titanium eventually can perhaps be displaced is not an inappropriate target. We've also commented that given our focus on the professional painting contractor and unwillingness to really change a lot of the raw material content in these products, who are likely to be lagger on that path, because this will be more of future products as opposed to our current product line. And I can tell you that all those activities continue to be under way with our R&D team.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin of CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Just curious about the store growth that you had this year and your expectations for next year. Are you focused on particular regions? And how would those regions compare with where you'll bulk up once the Comex deal gets approved?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Nils. As we have commented throughout our time here, that the Store growth will come literally across the entire geographic footprint that we've identified -- stores that we've managed is Canada, U.S. and the Caribbean. We have around 160 district managers, each of whom built a real estate plan. We don't have a single one of these districts that considers themself fully penetrated. So we have opportunities, literally, in every market across the United States. And typically, what we do is try to do about 70% of our store openings annually would be typical fill-ins, where we're giving one store to each of these districts. And then about 30% of that count will be more of a heavy-up concentration in markets where we're underpenetrated. We shared with the investment community that throughout all of Canada and the Western markets of the United States are where those underpenetrated markets are for us. And so we'll continue to heavy-up in those spaces. If we're successful in concluding the Comex transaction, their 300-plus store count beautifully lays over that density map and really strengthens our Canadian and Western Market store count. Even with those stores, however, we'll still be far from what we would consider to be full penetration. So this notion of continuing to add these stores at about this pace for years and years to come would remain part of our strategy. We've been talking about the ability to get to 5,000 stores throughout this North American geography. And with the addition of the Comex stores, plus the 80 stores we're planning to open this year, 70 to 80 stores that we have in the guidance, we would still be below 4,000 stores. So a long way to go.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Yes. And then just on your incremental margin in the Paint Stores Group was quite strong this year, around 30%. With new products bulking up on your SG&A, can you -- do you think you'll be able to continue that same sort of incremental margin or operating leverage in 2013 and beyond? Or is it -- will it decelerate some?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Just as you mentioned, the ROS that we -- margin that we did run the Stores Group this year was an all-time high, clips in the prior by 15 -- it was 15.5 the prior high. This year, 15.9. So when we used to talk about the 15.5 years ago, we'd say that's -- we don't think that's the top. We think if we continue to -- can get admin as a percent of sales down and other types of admin costs we think that we can beat it. We feel the same way of the 15.9. I don't think that next year, our management -- we still believe that we're going to have incremental flow-through that's very strong, as long as the market continues to recover.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silverstein with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "A couple of questions, if I may. I'm trying to understand your revenue guidance in light of what you're talking about improving markets. You're starting out the year with double -- with mid-single-digit growth in Paints, and you're going to end the year, overall, with low single-digit growth. So there's a deceleration coming in after the first quarter. And to follow up on earlier question, the first quarter seems to be the most difficult comps on year-over-year basis. I just want to understand with the contractors coming back, with commercial construction accelerating, with the housing market continuing to do better, why would you expect a slowdown in your growth rate as the year unfolds?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I'm just trying to pull out the press release. But I think in the first quarter, we gave you guidance of low-single-digit and mid-single-digit for the year. That would tell you that the second, third and fourth quarter is going to be stronger than the first quarter as far as year-over-year comparisons. And so, secondly, if you sit there and say, well, if start adding the 2 years together. Again, first quarter last year was the quarter, if you remember, stores grew kind of 20 -- approximately 20% comp store gain, and nearly half of that was price, whereas for the full year, we ended up with the mid-single digits for price. So as we go along, we're going to go have that hurdle of the price not helping us as we go along. So when you go from the first quarter at mid -- at low-single digits to mid, we see it exactly -- probably a little differently than you do.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Your press release is correct. But I think what you've said on this conference call, and you may have misspoken, that's what I picked up on, was the opposite. But okay, with the press release, it makes sense. You start out slow and you accelerate as the year unfolds. My second question is on the guidance range that you provided. It's $0.10 for the first quarter and $0.10 for the year. I guess I'm surprised by either too tight of a guidance for the year or too loose of a guidance first quarter. How do you feel about that? I mean, it looks like that there's -- it just seems that there should have been a wider guidance for the year. But perhaps, you'll feel better as the year unfolds in the total developments in the market?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think, it goes back to, Dmitry, I don't know how long you've been -- I lost track of when you started covering us, but prior to 2008, we used to give $0.10 guidance...", "Robert J. Wells", "Range.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Range. For the range. And when you take a look at what's happened, we actually at one year, we came out with $1 range. We said our EPS would come in between $3 and $4.", "Robert J. Wells", "I remember that.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And we actually came in at $3.78 that year. And when you take a look at it, it was because of the variability that was going on in raws and the markets. And there was a lot of different names that was going on in 2009, 2010. And as we said back then we got a lot of pressure: \"Why did you widen it too far?\" We said as we get more and more clarity, you'll see us reduce the size of this, the range.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "So the way to, I guess, really, the key, at least, way to interpret this is that the market seems to have subsided into a more normalized behavior that's more predictable from historical basis?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Correct.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "My questions will be easier. My first one was just trying to piece apart the guidance. It's a little tricky right now, because you're not factoring in any benefit from Comex but, obviously, you're taking a hit on the interest line. And just wanted to think through some of the moving parts. So on the share repurchase, you would think you are going to probably pull back with the deal ahead of you. Are you factoring anything related to share repurchase into the guidance?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Dennis, that was the hardest part to do this guidance. Because whether we complete the Comex deal or not, we're going to pay that interest. But we do have a factor -- we have a couple different scenarios when Comex occurs and so forth, I will tell you our guidance right now does show stock repurchase.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. And then just on the tax rate, what should we assume there?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We're a little higher than what we experienced the last 2 years, last year with the adjustments in the IRS and this year, when we came in at 31.1%. We think that we're going to be a little higher than that 31.1%, but no higher than 33%.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. So I think if you run that through and the top line assumptions. So might think you've talked about maybe it's modest margin expansion for the full year. And it sounds like you expect SG&A to be down on a year-over-year basis percentage of sales. So can you maybe just help us bridge that on a gross margin line, sort of what you're assuming and kind of that guidance on the low-single-digit raw material inflation, how that sorts out with some of the other action that you have?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, we don't want to go through line by line and tell you our guidance. But I think, mathematically, I think it's pretty easy to do if you use a tax rate a little higher than have today. Interest $20-some million higher than today. And you back in and if you use a slightly smaller share count, it's going to tell you what our operating margin is there. There is going to be improvement there. And so if you show the SG&A as a percent of sales improving, and I think that you can back into the gross margin if there's going to be gross margin improvement this year.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. I guess just on some of the top line. I think, Chris, you may have commented that maybe you're a little bit more conservative or conservative on the end channels just given some of volatility that you've seen lately. Is that true to across the domestic markets? Is there any one area where you guys are seeing maybe more volatility or more hesitancy among customers that makes, maybe, a little less confident in the recovery?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think the government actually came out this morning with the GDP estimates for the fourth quarter, which were retracted. And so when we look at our core more commercial, our protective and marine segments, commercial starts, those are things that we have a little less clarity at, Dennis. I think our guidance and our confidence really stems from this residential repaint domestic North American housing market, and that can carry us through a lot of rougher spots. And as we said, as we get into the year and we start to see a little better market dynamics unfolding, we'll be able to comment on that. But for right now, I think we're probably relying on this residential repaint market to be the driver.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt McGinley of ISI Group.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "On the consumer segment last quarter, you had stated that some of the weakness that you had there was across most product types and channels. Is that still the case? And what do you think is still driving that unit weakness in that segment?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think we did exactly say that, Matt, that our sales, both to our customers and their out-the-doors lagged the same sales performance that we're seeing through our own stores. Time will tell as we get into the selling season and come through the winter weather and that the spring paint season picks up for these folks. But our share position there has been maintained with the exception of the Walmart business, which we've commented on in the past. We did take some additional private label business there, that we're shifting from our manufacturer to a competitors' sourcing. And that was somewhat of an impact. But even factoring that out, this was a fairly flat performing segment for us.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "What do you think the long-run organic growth rate should be within that segment?", "Robert J. Wells", "Well, we've commented for a long period of time that our expectations are flat, low single-digit sales growth for this group. And this comes from the dynamics of the competitive landscape that we've created for ourselves in the United States. So the particular retail partners that we enjoy the business with will -- we benefit when they grow and improve. And time will tell how that all shakes out.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then a quick one on the inventory. Your inventory is basically down a little bit year-over-year. Was that primarily driven by this plan in raw material cost or your unit inventory's still down year-over-year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, our unit inventory is down. We're in pretty good shape with inventory. But there was improvement with terms and so forth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "When we talk about this environment you're seeing, Chris, for 2013, with the flatter price outlook, do you expect competition for volume to be a little more aggressive because price is not making up the difference for some paint manufacturers?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We've been blessed with great competition for 147 years, Chuck. We absolutely expect that there'll be competition for these gallons. And we face that the dynamic every single year, and we would expect to be in that same environment again this year.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "But do you think with less price inflation in there, it gets a little tougher, Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I'm not sure that I do. I mean, I think it's tough when you have price and then it's tough when there isn't price. We've been in this environment before. Even within the last several years, we've had periods of time when there was -- I think we went 22 months without a price increase back before this titanium run. And so we got through that segment. We had gallon gains in there against these same competitors that you're talking about. It really comes down to the quality of the product, the distribution support, the caliber of the field selling organization. These are all areas where we've been muscle-building, and we would expect to be able to actually be in a little stronger position this cycle that we were the last time, given the expansion in store counts and the widening of the gap of our service capabilities.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. And one for Sean. When you're talking about the guidance for 2013, do you have any expenses in there for the Comex transaction simply for what you have to spend on ahead of getting the deal done, similar to the debt financing?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Very little, Chuck. I think that -- you can imagine, we have some advisers that we are working with, but I would say it's going to be really immaterial to our first quarter.", "Robert J. Wells", "So we would see those immaterial in the first quarter, and you're still expecting a close by the end of the quarter.", "Christopher M. Connor", "That's in the hands of the government. And we are not really able to comment on that. We would -- we'd love to be able to make that date work, but time will tell.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "So we'll see that bulk of the transaction costs apart -- and separating from those from any integration costs, we'll see the bulk of those when you close?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. The quarter that the close, you're going to have the inventory step-up. You' going to have some other expenses, onetime only expenses that quarter will definitely be -- will be dilutive from the Comex acquisition because of those first quarter expenses, then it'll start to be accretive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Brian Maguire on for Bob today. Chris, I just want to clarify your comment on pricing for '13. I heard you say that there wasn't going to be any real benefit from pricing at '13. I just wanted to see if you're talking about no incremental price increases from here on out or does that mean that you wouldn't see the benefit from just anniversarying the price increases you've already done? In other words, is there truly no benefit year-over-year or is it just no benefit from here on out?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think when we made the comment, we didn't anticipate any pricing activity in the year, given where we see the raw material basket at this point in time, that guidance is as good as the word of raw material suppliers. And as we've commented frequently, we really are a raw material input cost pricer to our customers. So if we're able to maintain these kinds of raw material costs as we're entering the year or what we're forecasting the year, then we would anticipate very little pricing activity. Our last price increase was actually in February of last year. So there is a little bit of pricing still. We're at the very tail end of integrating that. So for the most part of this year, there won't be any lift from pricing activity.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just a follow-up as it relates to the gross margin outlook and if pricing is going to be kind of flat to modestly and if your raw outlook is for low-single-digit inflation, I don't think about there being much fixed cost in your model. I think more of a variable cost model. So does that imply your thinking and currently is sort of roughly flat to just modestly up gross margins?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, I think, when you start taking -- look, this is when you start asking sequentially. It's probably your answer there, sequentially, you can see that. But I think that if you go quarter-over-quarter, that first quarter, that gross margin was really depressed because the raws we're anniversarying and so forth and we were putting the price increase in. But we do expect to have gross margin improvement in the first quarter. And -- or else, we would it be able to get over that great quarter we had. But sequentially, I can understand your answer there.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Brian, and our margins have always been helped too as volumes increase, your point about the fixed costs of the company. So these incremental gallons start going through this entire supply chain, that has an impact on us as well, too. So for Sean's earlier answer to Dennis, if you do the math on that, I think you'll get to -- what we would expect to be another good year of margin, gross margin improvement for the company.", "Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in North America, 2 of your larger store competitors are apparently merging later this year. Do you anticipate any change in competitive behavior? Or how will that dynamic kind of influence you going forward?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, given the status of their acquisition as well, which has not been finalized, I think it would just be inappropriate to make any comments about that at this time.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "The question is on the gross profit dollar line. Can you give us, by segment, the delta in gross profit dollars that you often do?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. In Paint Stores Group was $96.2 million. In Consumer Group, it was actually backwards, $1.3 million. In the Global Finishes Group, $26.9 million. In the Latin America Group, it was an increase of $4.4 million.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "It looks almost as if in your Paint Stores Group, that you've kind of gotten back everything you gave away last year in the fourth quarter.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "That's -- I'll tell you that definitely looks -- I will tell you right there that you're accurate.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then one other question, just on reinvesting. Clearly, the acquisition of Comex is a major reinvest. You've talked about raising SG&A for new stores on reinvest. Where are we in other areas of the business? You've mentioned in the past that we don't need any capacity to come on board, I assume, for manufacturing. Is that still the case? And if you weren't doing the acquisition, how many stores would you have opened organically.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I don't think the store opening organic has been impacted at all by this acquisition. We are steady on this pace, 80 is a great number. We've said that's probably the sustainable number, as low as 50 to 60, as high as 100 over a long period of time, 80 is kind right in the sweet spot, on this march up to 5,000 stores. So there's been no capacity constraint or corporate constraint on our Stores Group to hold them back from growing in an appropriate pace. So I don't expect that to change. Regarding other investment opportunities there around the world for us, we have commented that after a fairly robust M&A period of building out infrastructure, both in Europe and Asia-Pacific, to service our OEM product finishes businesses that we feel comfortable with the infrastructure we have. Future acquisitions would likely be more, smaller technology bolt-ons than they would be brick-and-mortar. And the same can be said of Latin America, where we also have a pretty good infrastructure. We still remain interested in building all those businesses, and we'll look for the appropriate deals to do. North America still remains the key market where we have the ability to do open stores at this pace. And so that's where you can see us really focus our efforts going forward.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And if I may, the other thing that we've definitely are investing in is IT systems. If you tracked our company for quite a while back in the '90s, working capital was in the high-teens, almost 20%. We think what really help us -- what helped the operations to do that was IT. And I think we're starting to see some of that. That's going to help our cash flow, and, I think, down the road, as we continue to try to improve our cash generation for sales. So I think we're also doing that around the world as [indiscernible] bought these assets.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Before I go, is it okay to ask for the inventory adjustment dollar amount that you usually take at the end of the year, if it's available?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "It's not available. We're not there yet.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the SG&A spending. It looks like the unallocated portion, or the administrative line, was up significantly this year in dollars and as a percentage of sales. To the extent that, that's where some of the incentive comp or infrastructure spending is, is that the sort of right level to think of as a base going forward? Or was it impacted by the timing of incentive comp as the share price was rising? Just helping us understand how that -- what the new base is going forward there?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Everything you said there is really accurate. Really, this segment was really -- when you talk about the infrastructure, we just talked about IT as well as the compensation, including that stock-based compensation, this is where the growth occurred. I think from that from that standpoint, I think you'll see that over time flatten out and, actually, especially on the infrastructure spending, it will begin to reduce. The other thing that's in this group is or in this segment is our interest expense. Our interest expense has been flat the last 2 years in that $42 million to $43 million range with the $1 billion debt that will go up $20 million. So I think that any efficiencies we get in some of the other areas are going to be offset by the interest.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So it sounds like, so just to follow-up that, if you excluded the interest expense, you would expect the remainder to go down?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, over time, yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "One of the strongest pillars of the story has been your ability to get price and offset the raw mats. And surprisingly, in the last probably 45 days, the biggest raw mat basket, the petrochemicals and the propylene in particular, jumped, I think, meaningfully higher than most people would have guessed 4, 5 months ago. Was it just a bad timing? Or why wouldn't we be able to get some price on the back of that big raw material increase this year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think, as we've commented, Duffy, I mean, we  look at the basket of raws as they impact the company as opposed to any one individual segment. We comment about individual segments when they drive the entire basket up. But as we've given guidance about what we expect that total raw material impact for the company to be this year, that would not be the level that would cause us to take pricing to our customers.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then, if I remember, you guys used to sell some Pratt & Lambert paint through the Ace store system. How big is your business, Pratt & Lambert and other stuff, that would go through that, that may be at risk with a deal that Ace is doing with Valspar.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, you have a good memory. We have had, over the years, a number of independent Ace dealers take on the Pratt & Lambert product line. In this environment that Ace operates in, they can endorse programs and make it available to their co-ops through their distribution channel. But most of these independent dealers do carry products that they buy outside of that Ace relationship. And so we do not have a big exposure at Ace at this point in time. And the number of dealers that do carry Pratt & Lambert may or may not elect to continue with it per their announcement of their new paint partner. So time will tell. But that would not be an issue that you would hear us commenting on as impacting the company.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "You talked to us about in the fourth stepping up some SG&A investments across the business. I'm curious what that the target is in terms of the payback from that, if it's market share or if it's volume growth? What are you thinking that the payback might look like relative to those investments?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think that, and that's why I also mentioned the cash flow earlier, Eric. I think some of the IT spending that we did will actually help our working capital and actually help our cash generation outside the country. And we've been working on that for many years. Again, 40 of the 70 stores came into -- were opened in the fourth quarter. And so that's -- that's a high percentage in the fourth quarter. And I think down the road, I think they'll perform just like all the other stores do. And I think that just timing has caused that. So we expect to hopefully gain market share as we continue to open stores. So I think you're going to see the same timing from the stores. And I think in the next year or 2, you're going to see some nice cash flow coming out of our nondomestic group.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Great. And then, secondly, a year ago, I think the guidance for 2012, the initial guidance, you ended up exceeding by a pretty meaningful amount, perhaps $1 a share. I'm curious if you look back a year ago and think about the factors that you were considering and then where the year ended up, what did you do or what played out differently in '12 that allowed you to exceed by such a wide margin in your original expectation?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would tell you, $0.97, it was $5.52 to $6.49. And so when you take a look at it, a couple of things occurred, Eric. Number one was our sales performance at Stores. I think that Stores really had a great year. I think number two was the margin improvement in Global Finishes Group. I think that was stronger than what we had expected. I think that integration, where the fourth quarter 2011 was a little heavy in SG&A because of that integration. I think that if you look at that Global Finishes Group and what they were able to do, I think those were the 2 areas. Latin America Group did improve. And Consumer, I think, was fairly close to what we expected.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Silke Kueck of JPMorgan.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I was wondering whether I could try one more raw materials question, if you're not tired of it yet.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Of course, you can.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So what you said is this, is that your TiO2 prices seemed more stable in 2013. So in a way, if they stayed stable from where they were at the end of 2012, that really would mean that there's still a significant benefit on a year-over-year basis in the first half of '13, right?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, there was a decline in TiO2 pricing in the back half of '12, which put TiO2 pricing below, certainly, below 2012 peak at year-end.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Right. And my memory with propylene prices is set. I mean, I know they're back at $0.77. But the last thing -- but same thing happened last year. And that is if you look at propylene prices for February, March, April, I think they were like $0.77, maybe they were $0.76. So on a year-over-year basis, like the propylene costs may not been -- I see how that cost sequentially, they'll move, but a new year-over-year basis, like those comparisons may not be as difficult as you make them out at first sight?", "Robert J. Wells", "I think a low single-digit inflation expectation across our total raw material basket is not -- I don't think that's a dire outlook. Certainly, not relative to our expectation over the past few years at the beginning -- at this time in the year.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So I can understand how you're like reasonably -- confident that, like, this 45% gross margin is probably sustainable for like at least another 6 months or so.", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think that's right.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. The second thing is I wanted to understand what really happened to volumes in the -- on the Consumer Group side. Like where -- so because this is now the second quarter in a row of volumes were negative. And what exactly is happening? Because I didn't detect these volume declines like anywhere else.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, it's mostly Walmart, Silke. And as we've commented, we've been losing share inside that for a while there.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I thought you gave that up already.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "The brand and material was replaced by Glidden immediately. And the significant portion of Walmart's vibe has been their private level under their Color Place brand name. And so the process there was that was to be a phase-in over a period of time. We were going from some percentage of their distributions that we supplied to significantly lower. And those adjustments were taking place in the third and fourth quarter. That's really the headwind that our Consumer Group was facing.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, I understand. Sorry, I forgot that. And has anything changed in your goal to explore the Canadian Stores market now that PPG owns the Glidden stores there?", "Robert J. Wells", "Well, our intentions have always been to continue to organically open stores throughout Canada, following our Stores model. And one of the real bright spots in this potential Comex acquisition is a brand called General Paint that operates out of British Columbia. And that will bring a significant store count boost to our plans in Canada. So we would expect to make significant progress in Canada this year organically, and then maybe get a real shot in the arm when we get this transaction closed.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Can you enlighten us what the Comex exposure is in Canada?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, General is the brand name. The store count in Canada was...", "Christopher M. Connor", "78 stores.", "Robert J. Wells", "78 stores. Yes.", "Silke Kueck-Valdes - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And if I could, a last question is like TiO2 question again. I wanted to ask it with raw materials, then I forgot. Has sulfur-based TiO2 from China made a difference to the global supply demand balance at all? I understand that Sherwin uses chloride-based TiO2, but I was just wondering whether you had a view?", "Robert J. Wells", "Silke, clearly, the chloride producers have been talking about soft market conditions and weak demand all year long. And whether that is truly weak global demand or less than robust demand partially offset or partially satisfied by increasing sulfide capacity is hard to tell. But we suspect that it might be some of the latter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just one quick question. So when we look at the sales growth that you saw and earnings growth you saw in the Paint Store or throughout your businesses, and so the Paint Store Group, Lat Am, the Consumer side, they vary pretty significantly. If you have any information or data on it, can you let us know kind of which one Comex might have mirrored more likely through the fourth quarter and 2012? Was it closer to the Paint Store type growth or was it more similar to the Lat Am growth?", "Robert J. Wells", "I think it's probably a hybrid of both of those. Their model would indicate that because they have such a strong distribution network and they're selling to the professional painting contractor, they would have participated in more the Mexican market growth scenario. And we think Mexico actually is a pretty good place right now. Their GDP outperformed the U.S. this past year. Their housing markets and their commercial construction businesses were stronger than ours were. So their performance should mirror closer to that. We have not commented on this private company's results yet. And we will, obviously, when we close, give you a lot more transparency there, John. But at this point in time, I think you just have to kind of look at the Mexican GDP market and know that Comex would be a good proxy for this same kind of businesses, housing, et cetera, that we enjoyed through our Stores business year.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time.

In order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com under Investor Relations First Quarter Press Release.", "Summarizing overall company performance for first quarter 2013 versus first quarter 2012. Consolidated net sales increased 1.4% to $2.17 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Acquisitions increased net sales 1% in the quarter, which was fully offset by unfavorable currency translation. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $53 million for the quarter to $962.9 million. Gross margin increased 180 basis points to 44.4% of sales from 42.6% in the first quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased $21 million over first quarter last year to $778.7 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 35.9% in the first quarter this year from 35.5% last year. Interest expense increased $5 million compared to the first quarter last year due to an increase in long-term debt to finance the Comex acquisition. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $26.1 million or 18.3% to $168.4 million. Our effective tax rate in the first quarter this year was 31% compared to 29.6% in the first quarter of 2012. For the full year 2013, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the low 30s compared to last year's rate of 30.4%. Consolidated net income increased $16 million to $116.2 million. Net income, as a percent of sales, was 5.4% compared to 4.7% in the first quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased to $1.11 per share from $0.95 per share in 2012.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2013 increased 4% to $1.17 billion from $1.12 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 3.2%. The increase in sales for the segment was due entirely to higher paint sales volumes across most market segments. Regionally in the first quarter, our Southwest division led all divisions, followed by Southeast division, Midwest division and Eastern division. Sales were positive in 3 of the 4 geographic divisions. Segment profit for the group increased 15.1% to $129.7 million in the quarter, as higher sales volumes and gross margin improvement more than offset higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 11.1% of sales from 10% in the first quarter last year.", "Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the first quarter decreased 3.7% to $308.6 million due primarily to the previous disclosed elimination of some paint business with large retail customers that was partially offset by acquisitions. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $1.3 million to $54 million in the quarter from $55.3 million in first quarter last year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 17.5% from 17.3% in the same period last year. The improvement in operating margin was due primarily to continued tight expense control and operating efficiencies driven by volume growth in the Paint Stores Group.", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 0.8% to $486.8 million in the quarter due primarily to selling price increases and acquisitions, mostly offset by unfavorable currency translation. In the quarter, acquisitions increased net sales by 1%, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased sales by the same amount. First quarter segment profit increased 18.5% to $33.9 million due primarily to higher selling prices and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by unfavorable currency and acquisitions. The combination of currency translation and acquisitions reduced segment profit by $1.8 million. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 7% from 5.9% in the same period last year.", "For our Latin American Coatings Group. The first quarter net sales decreased 2.1 -- 2.9% to $202.6 million due to unfavorable currency translations that was partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 6.6% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the quarter increased to $20.8 million from $19.9 million last year. Good expense control and higher selling prices more than offset a $1.7 million drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 10.3% in the quarter compared to 9.5% in the first quarter of 2012.", "Turning briefly to the balance sheet. Our total debt on March 31, 2013 was $1.7 billion, including short-term borrowings of $68.3 million. Total debt on March 31 last year was $1.32 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $613.9 million compared to $25.5 million at the end of first quarter 2012. In the first quarter of this year, we spent $31.2 million on capital expenditures, depreciation expense was $38.9 million and amortization expense was $7.7 million. For the full year 2013, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $130 million to $150 million, depreciation will be about $150 million and amortization will be about $30 million.", "I'll conclude this review with a brief comment on the status of our lead litigation. The Santa Clara case involving claims and public nuisance brought by 10 cities and counties in California against 5 dependent companies continues to move forward. The judge presiding over the case has set the case for trial on June 24, 2013.", "That concludes our review of the results for first quarter 2013. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. There's been a lot of volatility in the market in recent weeks around U.S. housing and building materials, and it seems that every new data point is being dissected for clues about the durability of this recovery. While a few of the recent indicators appear to be heading in the wrong direction, most notably the NAHB builder sentiment index, as well as March single-family housing starts and residential permits, the majority of the data still points to a robust and sustainable recovery.", "I think our sales results in the first quarter support that conclusion. Although our revenue growth was only 1.4%, keep in mind the 15.1% sales increase in first quarter 2012 was an extremely difficult comparison. Aside from the obvious difference in weather this year, the calendar was also a challenge. We lost the equivalent of 2 full business days in the quarter compared to last year, and Easter week fell in March this year versus April last year. Despite these expected headwinds, our consolidated revenue and volume were both positive.", "The purest read we have in the health of the domestic market comes from our Paint Stores Group. With all the challenges we faced in Q1, our comp store sales grew more than 3%. If you look at interior paint sales versus exterior, you get an even better perspective on the difference between first quarter '12 and '13. Sales of interior products this year increased almost 10% on top of strong double-digit growth last year, while exterior sales were slightly better than flat. A relative softness in our exterior business was not only a drag in revenue and volume compared to last year but also on mix because exterior paint commands a higher average price per gallon and higher gross margin. This mix shift resulted in volume growth that was higher than revenue growth for the quarter.", "Obviously, our Paint Stores Group wasn't the only segment affected by the weather and calendar. A loss of business days in the quarter reduced shipments across all segments of the company, and winter weather significantly affected demand for protected and marine products, as well as architectural. We commented on our first quarter call last year that unseasonably warm weather doesn't create demand for paint, it creates opportunity to paint. The good news this year is that normal seasonal cold and wet weather doesn't destroy demand for paint, it simply postpones it. And we are encouraged by the demand trends we've seen so far in the second quarter.", "This was our fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year gross margin improvement, clear evidence of the progress we've made in containing raw material costs and recovering the gross margin erosion we experienced in 2010 and 2011. We expect this trend to continue, although the rate of improvement should diminish as we go through the year.", "Based on what we saw during the first quarter, we've tempered our raw material cost outlook for the year. Industry average pricing for most of the key raw materials used in paint and coatings continues to moderate as TiO2 pricing has remained stable, and propylene, a key feedstock for resins, latex and solvents, has come off its February highs. We now believe average annual raw material cost for the industry will be flat with 2012 versus our January outlook of low single-digit inflation.", "Our working capital, which we measure as inventories plus receivables minus payables, decreased as a percent of sales to 11.7% from 12.7% in the first quarter last year. The reduction in working capital, combined with the increase in net income in the quarter, more than offset the $80 million cash contribution we made through our ESOP plan to satisfy our agreement with the Department of Labor. Taking all this into account, net operating cash in the quarter increased by almost $64 million compared to first quarter last year.", "During the quarter, we acquired 0.5 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, at an average cost of $162.88 per share, for a total investment of $81.4 million. On March 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire 15.95 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, up from $0.39 last year.", "Our Paint Stores Group added 9 net new stores during the quarter, and our plan calls for full year store openings in the range of 70 to 80 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 3,529 locations compared to 3,455 1 year ago. This year-over-year increase in store locations, along with the investments we made in store and territory staffing in the back half of last year, resulted in a 40-basis-point increase in SG&A as a percent of sales in the quarter. As our revenue growth accelerates, our SG&A will decline as a percent of sales, and we expect to finish the year below the 2012 level of SG&A as a percent of sales.", "We remain optimistic that U.S. architectural paint market volumes, primarily in the residential segments, will strengthen as we get into the prime painting season. Our outlook for second quarter 2013 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the range of 5% to 9% compared to last year second quarter. With sales of that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $2.50 to $2.60 per share compared to last year's record, $2.17 per share.", "For the full year 2013, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2012 by a mid-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $7.45 and $7.55 per share compared to last year.", "Finally, I'd like to comment briefly on our progress on the Comex acquisition. We completed the regulatory review process in 2 of 3 countries. Although we remain confident that this transaction will close, it is impossible to predict the timing at this point. We remain hopeful that it'll be sometime in the second quarter. As you would expect, we are making productive use of this interim period to prepare our company for a seamless integration and a fast start once the transaction is complete. Until that time, I'm sure you respect the fact that we cannot disclose information about Comex operations, financial performance or additional details of the transaction.", "Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Chris, the interior versus exterior paint demand differential that you pointed out, do you think the exterior's performance was a function of the tough comp from a year ago? Or is it just all the more unfavorable weather in March across the country?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, the answer is yes to both of those. I mean, that was the whole point. And we saw reasonable seasonal exterior sales gains in our Southern market, but it was the Northern markets that were painting outside last year that really saw a decline in exterior gallons. Take those 2 together, we delivered a flat exterior performance for the Stores Group.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then can you just kind of parse out what you're seeing residential versus commercial as best as you can tell?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think as we've been commenting for some time, it is the residential portions of this architectural market that are rebounding, both in the new construction, as well as in the repaint. Commercial tends to lag that. We've begun to see some lift in the commercial repaint as occupancy rates improve, not so much a lift yet in the new construction portion of that business.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one final one on Global Finishes. For the second quarter last year, it was a very, very strong performance from a margin perspective, seems like a tough comp. Do you think margins will be up in Global Finishes year-over-year during the second quarter of '13?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think when -- we were pretty happy with the operating margins in Global Finishes. We've done some things to structurally help that business. And we don't give guidance by segment. But we were not surprised that Global Finishes operating margin improved this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "A couple questions. One, just housekeeping, if you can help us with the gross profit dollar growth you sometimes share with us by segment, would be great.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. I've got it right here. The Stores Group, the incremental gross profit dollars were $37,663,000; the Consumer, incremental $2,891,000; and the Global Finishes Group, $13,734,000. And then LACG was negative. It was dilutive $793,000.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "One or 2 other quick things, if I could. The 2-year volume trends underlying seem to be quite strong. If you did a 3 against what we had calculated as a 13, would put kind of the 2-year volume up near 16, and we had it about 8.9 in last quarter and 4 the quarter before that. Is that kind of a proper gauge of underlying momentum in the business?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think you're directionally correct, Aram.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. And then the last thing is on SG&A. Last year, SG&A as a percent of sales by quarter, you did 35.5% in the first quarter and a 31.5% in the second quarter. You did about 20% more sales in the second quarter than the first. So my question is this, if your volumes in Q1 were to grow by 20% over 2-year period of time, why wouldn't their SG&A ultimately get to where your Q2 SG&A rate is today?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Because what ends up happening is, is that our SG&A rate is a step function. And so to get that 20% sales volume that you speak of, we'll probably have more stores. We'll probably have more reps. We'll have more SG&A that will flatline itself against the quarters. If that occurs, you're going to see to get that 20% increase in the first quarter. Actually, you also get a second quarter pop also. So that sales curve really -- when -- that's why a lot of times when people ask, \"What's your fixed versus variable?\" We think the fixed is a lot higher because store manager, assistant manager, all those things are fixed, and that sales curve to get that 20%. Now if you're saying, structurally, we were able to get the 20% more without any additions in stores, reps or other things, then you would see it drive down, yes.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Okay. Yes. Because I noticed you're still running about a little less than 70%. Let's say, the SG&A growth divided by revenue growth is maybe a good function too.  Are you still trying to be in that kind of 55%, 57% kind of range?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Could you help decompose the same-store sales into price volume components?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, that's a pretty easy answer, Bob. There's absolutely no price in the comp store performance this year.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then what's your expectation, I think, Chris, you mentioned that none of the seasonal patterns or weather patterns alter underlying demand. So would you expect that in the Midwest and East, you're going to see a much better comp versus sort of the Southwest and Southeast in the second quarter?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, absolutely. And I think that's implied in our guidance for the quarter's revenue being up 5% to 9%. As you'd expect, our stores numbers will outpace that, and that will be a result of the Northern division also starting to participate in the same kind of robust rebound we're seeing in these residential markets across the whole country.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Then my last one, if I could quickly, on raw materials. Can you give us a sense for what the residence time is between, on the outside, us seeing a propylene price move up or down and when it might reveal itself on a cost of goods line? And then, secondly, you seem a little bit more -- less aggressive about what's happening in TiO2 prices than maybe we've seen in the market. Is there some reason you wouldn't be fully benefiting from the sell-off in those prices?", "Robert J. Wells", "Bob, this is Bob. Let me take the second part of the question first. TiO2 thus far this year -- I mean, it certainly came down in the back half last year. But thus far this year, it's been relatively stable. And you know there are at least 3 producers in the market right now with price increase announcements. So we mentioned that there was a fair amount of volatility or that there was a fair amount of stability in TiO2, but we do not necessarily believe that it goes down in the back half from here. Time will tell. On propylene, the rule of thumb that we've been using is that it takes about 90 days for a moving propylene to get fully into the raw material basket, much faster on the solvents side of the business than on the resins and packaging side. So 90 days, I think, is a pretty good rule of thumb to see that -- the moving propylene fully priced into the raw material basket.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And is it possible on quick spikes that you could actually miss that or no? What we saw in the first quarter?", "Robert J. Wells", "We'll see it on solvents. Whether a quick spike, up and back down, gets into the acrylic chain or into plastic packaging...", "Christopher M. Connor", "Maybe not.", "Robert J. Wells", "Maybe not.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar of Citi.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "The big boxes seem to want a piece of the contractor business. I think one of your competitor is starting a new program at Lowe's. Historically, these big boxes haven't had much success with contractors. So how do you see that playing out this time?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, P.J., I think we've long said that we have tremendous respect for these competitors. And they have compelling product lines and offerings and are continuing to see what we see in the market, which is that the shift towards a professional painting contractor is the primary purchase of architectural paint. I think we've been competing with these folks for over 27 years now, recognizing these same demographic trends. And the data results that we've shared with you and the entire investment community would indicate that painting contractors continue to remain remarkably loyal to the dedicated paint store channel. So it's incumbent upon us that are in that space to continue to enhance the product offering, the service, the reasons that have kept them loyal there. And we'll take on this next challenge as we have all the other ones over the past 20 years.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And I think you've gained share with homebuilders during the downturn. So as the new residential construction picks up, should we expect better volume growth from you compared to the industry?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you just give us what kind of share did you gain during the downturn?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think we've talked about just kind of the top 25 U.S. homeowners and what our relative position has been there as opposed to any strict share number. And as the industry went into their downturn, a lot of these large builders consolidated purchasing activities from regional offices into a consolidated office. And Sherwin was uniquely in a position with a national footprint to be able to service these folks, regardless of what part of the geography they're operating in. So as a result, we're proud to comment that well north of 20, the top 25 builders now are good Sherwin's customers, and quite a number of them are exclusive with us. So as they come back up, that's a much stronger position than we were in the last time we went through one of these housing rebounds.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And I just have a quick clarification question maybe for Sean. In this Consumer Group segment, you talk about loss of large retail customer. You've talked about Walmart business in the past that you lost. Is that the same continuing issue here?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. We continue to have a step-down function into the fourth quarter. It's affected us negatively. And again, in the first quarter, it affected us negatively.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "But wasn't the initial Walmart business lost a couple of years ago and that should have anniversaried by now?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. But as we -- it was not a complete severing. What it was, was a discussion and a movement from DSCs [ph]. If you remember, we had the majority, there was other -- 2 other paint companies in there. Those other 2, they did go cold turkey on those, but on us, it was a lock. And now they have the majority. And we've got another step function that affected us in the fourth quarter for this year.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. Specifically, P.J., it's in the private label segment. So you're correct that the Glidden brand immediately replaced our brand. There's been this private label piece that's been a little less visible and is stepping down exactly Sean just took you through.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chris Nocella of RBC.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to circle back on your comment that you're encouraged by the demand trends in the second quarter. Is it to say your order books are strong for some of the bigger projects? Or is it a little more broad-based than that?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, it's more broad-based than that. And we don't typically have an order book per se. It's more the anecdotal evidence of the painting contractors that are in our stores. We get some future look at the types of products they're buying that are non-paint. So for example, we've always talked about spray equipment sales as being a good leading indicator of the confidence of painting contractors as they're heading into the paint season. Here again this year, on top of pretty robust numbers last year, our spray equipment sales are doing terrific. And we just are cognizant that these men and women have a lot of work lined up. They're hiring painters, they've got a full load ahead of them and a lot of confidence that this is going to be another repeat performance for a solid residential repaint year.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just on Comex, I appreciate the deal hasn't closed and you don't have the full financials yet. But can you just remind us of the accretion potential that you expect, and the trajectory to get there?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. What we said is we feel that the first 12 months will be accretive, slightly accretive because of the closing costs, the inventory write-up and some of the other GAAP requirements. And -- but then after that, we believe that if we close here in a relatively short period of time, we're looking at $1 accretion the first full year we own it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Chris, question on gross margin potential. I mean, you started off the year with some pretty strong gross margins, even though your exterior mix went against you. So do you think you can be on track to equal that 46% gross margin peak you had back in '09?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think we've been talking about continuing to move towards that. I don't think we're getting guidance that we're going to be all the way back of north of 46%. 180 basis points improvement we're making right now in this quarter will start to moderate, as we did start to have some margin recovery in the back half of last year as well, too. So that might be a little high, but we'll be moving towards that number.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a question on industry volumes. I mean, the DOC doesn't put their series out anymore, but you've talked about maybe getting to normalized of 700-million- to 750-million-gallon market number in the U.S. Where did we end last year? And what kind of market growth are you looking for this year?", "Robert J. Wells", "Don, this is Bob. The American Coatings Association put out an estimate of volumes for full year 2012 that was in the mid-3% range. Our estimate was closer to 3% flat. So somewhere in that range feels right. That would have put us in the 630-million- to 640-million-gallon range. So still, probably incremental 100 million gallons to come back to the market over some recovery time frame.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chris, you affirmed the guidance range for the year of $7.45 to $7.55. And I'm wondering if your embedded assumptions therein for existing home sales and housing starts are any different today relative to what they would have been exiting the fourth quarter.", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, I don't think we've really changed that assumption or impact on our guidance. As we commented, in my opening comments, about kind of the numbers were kind of jumping all over the place, I think there's enough other weight in this business, primarily in the maintenance of these projects, that are really the key driver for us. So we're still confident that we've got the right market dynamics to deliver the numbers that we're projecting.", "Robert J. Wells", "The other thing, Kevin, if you look at housing starts over the course of 2012, they ramped up over the year so that the exit rate from that year was a pretty good indicator of where we were going to be at least at the start of the year in 2013. So we weren't operating blind.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And Kevin, this is Sean. Many -- for the last few years, many years, we've never really changed guidance for the full year after the first quarter. Goes back to the other question, you look at the sales curve, I think that even last year up for the first quarter -- because it was so dramatic, we changed it slightly. But when you really take a look at it, we usually wait until after the second quarter, which is a large quarter for us.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So Sean, to follow up, it sounds like your raw material forecast has improved relative to what it would have been. Is it the case that you're being relatively conservative in keeping the range the same since it is early in the year? Or rather, is it the case that there's some offsets that you're cognizant of that would equilibrate it back to flat?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think -- I wouldn't use the word conservative. I think, I mean you have to -- there's a lot of moving pieces in these forecasts, and there's a lot of ongoing volatility on the pricing of many key raw material input. So again, we'll have better visibility on the year for raw materials, as well as a lot of the other factors after the second quarter.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then final question, if I may, just to drill down a little bit more on your exterior coatings experience. If we were to lump together the Southwest and the Southeast, what would those exterior volumes look like relative to the Midwest and the East? Just trying to get a sense for what the magnitude of the variances there within the company, if there's anything you can share.", "Christopher M. Connor", "I would comment that we were down double digit in the Northern markets, and the Southern markets were a more normalized sales growth.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Nils Wallin of CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Just curious on the loss of the business at Walmart. When will this anniversary?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I think that, again, as in all of our \u2013 Walmart's a great customer. We're in there. We're showing them different products. We hope it never -- hope it ends very soon. But I would tell you that with this change, each -- this year, I think that the last time you'll see the effect of the Walmart will be at the end of the third quarter. It did affect us in the fourth quarter. So this change in the distribution centers from us to the other supplier will anniversary in the third quarter.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "And by losing this business, is there actually a benefit on the mix at all? I mean, is this a low-margin business? Are you -- I mean, you probably don't want to lose the volume, but maybe on a positive side, it may not be the best in terms of margin.", "Robert J. Wells", "You know what, when you look at the Consumer Group margin, it did help the gross margin percent. It definitely did not help the gross margin dollars. And if we had a choice, we'd rather have the dollars. But -- and it was good business. I mean, the -- you had another supplier who wanted it because of the price of the SG&A. And the operating margin was a nice business for us.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, Research Division", "Great. And just finally on Global Finishes. It looks like over -- when you layer in the drag from ForEx, that the, obviously, margin improvement year-on-year has been quite strong. And you point to operating efficiencies. Is there -- can you drill down a little bit more? Is there some capacity rationalization? What's driving this improvement so much on the operating efficiency side?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we talked last year, Nils, about the fact that after a fairly robust acquisition schedule over the past couple of years, that we were in the phase of really rationalizing, justifying the manufacturing distribution portion of that, particularly in Europe. And so there was some rightsizing of operations that we needed to address. So that's primarily behind us as we head into this calendar year. We've also commented a little bit about the pricing discipline that's been part of the company's operating mantra in North America, that we needed to get implemented in Europe. And we've seen that take place as well, too. So most of it's come from our European operations. We still have the opportunities ahead of us and some final little cleanups, both in Asia Pacific, as well as Europe. But pleased to see that this group is really on the right track. We've long said that we believe we can get this business into a double-digit return on sales operating margin performance, and they're making good strides toward that.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Matt McGinley of ISI.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "On your guidance, you imply a pretty healthy step-up on the margin rates in the second quarter. It almost looks like it could be 2006- or 2007-type levels. Would you expect to continue to build that margin from a gross margin standpoint? Or would you leverage SG&A? And given the investment that you're making in the stores, what level of sales today do you think you need to leverage SG&A?", "Robert J. Wells", "I think that for the second quarter, where we are in the step function of the SG&A, I think you're right about the guidance. I think there's got to be efficiencies. And you can see the SG&A as a percent of sales show improvement. And I think going back to Chris' remarks by the end of the year, we believe that SG&A, we expect it to be lower as a percent of sales. So I think that tells you, being up 4/10 in the first quarter, I think we have to have improvement in each of the following 3. Gross margin, same thing. Echoing Chris' remarks, we felt that gross margin will show improvement. So I think we're going to see it in both. So I think we're at volumes that we're going to see efficiency.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And I have one on Mexico as a market. Can you tell us a little bit about how the trends are in your stores in Mexico? Is that a better market generally than maybe the rest of Latin America or the U.S.? And from a timing standpoint, with this Comex deal, is there a certain date that if you can't close it by, it would not be accretive, where the math wouldn't work out on a current year basis?", "Robert J. Wells", "Matt, this is Bob. Let me handle the first half of that question, and that is just the overall market environment in Mexico. Mexico had a rough year in 2012 due to some foreclosure activity, but long term, it is going to be a very attractive market. The rate of household formation per capita is much higher than that of the U.S. It's a young market, with more than 40% of the population under the age of 34. And per capita income and GDP is growing. So from a construction and maintenance standpoint, Mexico is going to be a very attractive market. And our business in Mexico has been performing well.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. And as we speak of Comex and our expectations [indiscernible] that's why we continue to use the word 12 months, not in the current year. We believe that it'll be slightly accretive in the first 12 months and -- but you're right, the first quarter is going to be dilutive. And as -- the later it goes, the less chance it'll be accretive from a calendar year 2013 because of the closing. And you're right, there is a date that we cross that it won't be there. So -- but instead of sharing that date, we'd rather wait until we can close so we can give you a lot more details.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Most of them have been answered. Just real quick on the Brazil market, your volumes are flat in Latin America. Have you seen -- there's an expectation that you're going to have the Olympics, World Cup, et cetera, and that you should see construction pick up. Have you seen any signs of that? And what's sort of your outlook for that business going forward?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we're painting some stadiums in Brazil as we speak. So there's definitely work that's happening. I think, Brazil, by their own admission, would tell you that they're behind on their schedule of their construction projects. So there should be some acceleration as we get closer to the 2014 dates. The slowdown and softness in the Brazilian economy is much broader than just preparing for these games. So housing has been off a little bit, the construction has been off a little bit. I don't think that this administration has been as productive for the country's GDP as the previous one. And I know it was a concern of theirs. But here again, as Bob has commented, on the long-term prospects for Mexico, we remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Brazil as well and are continuing to strengthen our operations down there.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then last question. I know this is small, but is there -- do you have any business in Argentina? And is that impacting that segment at all?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we do have business in Argentina. We've been in the country for over 80 years. Argentina has been a middle of the road performer in our Latin American operations, and I think they're doing fine.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "If you start taking a look at the rest of the year, Chris, how would you describe the need or lack thereof for pricing in the Paint Stores Group in the U.S.?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think to our comments about flat raw materials for the remainder of the year, that would typically be the environment that we hold pricing in. We've made no indications of our intention to the contrary. As you know, Chuck, our policy is always to let our customers know first. And shortly thereafter, we openly transcribe with the investment community. This date, we've got nothing to share with you.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. With regard to industrial coatings markets, how would you describe those in the first quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think from the protective coatings, which -- are you talking about protective or more OEM?", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "More protective, but OEM, I would lump in with that question as well.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Okay, so I think we commented on protective coatings as a soft quarter for us, and most of that is related to bridge and highway painting activities that were delayed due to weather this year compared to last year. But as we commented on the exterior gallons struggling, that impacted this business segment as well. But the underlying requirement demand for these products and the maintenance environments which really can't be delayed, that looks pretty good to us. We expect that business to rebound and continue on through the year. And the OEM product finishing segments, which are embedded in the Global Finishes Group, particularly in North America, continue to do nicely. A little softness in the European market demand, driven by the general softness in that part of the world. But, again, overall, a pretty good story for us this year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Your administrative costs fell about $4 million or $5 million year-over-year in the quarter, and that was in spite of your interest costs for the quarter going up about $5 million. So your net administrative costs or your pure administrative costs look like they fell about $10 million. Why did -- in the quarter. Why did they do that? And what's your outlook for that line for the year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Jeff, as you know, when you look at that administrative, we've had -- over the last 2 to 3 years, we've had some major growth in that area. And we continue to talk about some of the projects, IT projects, other things that we were working on and investing in. And we see that -- we're still working on a few of those projects, but we're trying to complete some of these and look for some efficiencies. You're also right, when you look at the interest, I think that the core without Comex because of the $1 billion that we did borrow at around 2 -- a little over 2%. It's going to cost us to have interest rates -- interest expense of $20 million, $5 million a quarter. I think that the first quarter, there was a few things that were -- we started to see with this. But I think we're still going to see some improvement without interest but -- throughout the year but without the Comex acquisition occurring. But it won't be as dramatic as it was in the first quarter.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, everybody has different ideas about where paint raw materials will be. Yours are that they'll be flat for the year, and, I guess, mine are that they'll be lower for the year. If it turns out that I'm right, that is that raw materials are lower for the industry in general, do you think average paint prices in the consumer business will decrease or in the contractor business or that the contractor market generally will decrease? Or do you think that they would hold flat even in a declining raw material environment?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, Jeff, we hope you're right. And I would tell you that in past cycles like this, we've commented that we will see overall lower pricing, particularly on bid business where large projects -- when contractors are out bidding for that, they'll be giving competitive quotes, and we'll see folks go for gallon and market share enhancements. So as we have in past cycles, we would expect to see lower year-over-year pricing quoted on that type. And as a reminder, we think that represents about 20% of a typical demand of architectural products. The vast majority of our products, which we would call our typical shop account pricing, we've had a track record of being able to hang onto that pricing in that environment. So if that remains flat and the 20% dropped a little bit, you might see a little bit year-over-year deflationary pricing. On the consumer side of that, I don't know that we have as much insight into that or as much exposure to that, frankly, and have much beyond the comment on your analysis.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John Roberts of UBS.", "John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "Could you update us a little bit on some of your initiatives, like Emerald? And you've now lapped yourself on HGTV. How are some of those programs going?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we've been thrilled with both of those introductions, John. Thanks for asking. Emerald, at the very high end of our architectural product line, both on interior and exterior, not that it would ever be the primary mover of products, but it does set the bar, and we kind of get that mix shift up the chain as we talked about it in years past. So meeting company's expectations for gallon growth. And I would say that HGTV probably is doing even a little better than that. We've commented, I think, not so much in this call but past several calls, that our DIY performance inside that stores group has been outperforming the industry. We believe we've been gaining share slightly from a low base. And HGTV clearly is helping the company skew to a lower age customer group. We can see that in our demographics through our POS information we get. And all that just portends to a better future. We're introducing customers to the advantages of shopping in the specialty paint store earlier in the paint-buying career, and they tend to be loyal to that cycle. So HGTV has been a big win for the company.", "John E. Roberts - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated", "And then in your regional breakdown that you had, Bob, the Eastern region was mostly impacted by weather change. I assume like exterior was down a lot there. Was interior up in the Eastern region even though the total region was down?", "Robert J. Wells", "No, John, I don't know the answer to that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Charles Dan of Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First of all, just so we're all using the right number, can you tell us what interest expense you have for the full quarter that's in your guidance?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I won't share the guidance, but I think our interest expense and, we have it on the P&L, it's right here on the \u2013 I'll tell you right \u2013 I've got it here. Our interest expense was $15,311,000. Last year, it was $10,337,000.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So that's a good run rate for the second quarter as well?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, fine. And my second question is on your -- it seemed like the cash drag in the quarter from building working capital in advance of the painting season is much less this quarter than it has been historically in prior years. Is that just reflective of lower raw material costs or more efficiency? Or what's explaining that? Or was it just something that's going to leak into the second quarter this year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I think that 2 years ago, we come in and then we built inventory in the first quarter 2011, much higher than we had in the past. And it dealt with raw material availability and so forth. In '12, we felt a little less pressure as far as availability, and we allowed -- we had a more normal build. And this year, I would say we've adjusted, and we feel pretty good about the efficiencies in our supply chain. And we feel pretty good. I don't think -- I think this is probably going to be more of the normal curve going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard of Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Obviously, with the weather, it's hard to sift through the volumes in 1Q. But as you think about the full year '13 relative to '12 in terms of the architectural growth, you talked what the government and your sense of growth was last year. But I'm interested, as your customers, what your sense is over the growth rate of '13 relative to '12 for the industry and then your relative market share performance in '13 relative to '12.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, I would say, Eric, that the industry growth rate, as we commented, historically, should run in that 1% to 2% from architectural. And because we're below age here, we said that double that is a reasonable number to start with. So let's assume that the industry is going to have gallon growth in the 3% to 4% range and we've been comfortable saying that stores business can run in a 1.5x that pace, so our expectation would be that our gallons this year are going to be north of 5%.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "As you look at the first, call it, 4 months of the year, what are the plusses and minuses relative to that? What do you see that gives you sort of positive thinking about that and where you have concerns in regards to getting to that level of growth in 2013?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We don't have any concerns about getting to that gallons number in 2013 right now.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "With regard to the SG&A jump that we saw year-over-year, which looked like it was about $20 million or so, how much of any of that is tied to preparing for Comex that might not be something that recurs going forward once you've actually closed on the acquisition?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, very small, less than $2.5 million, really, in the preparation of Comex. One of -- you're right, it was up around 21%. So less than -- probably around 10% of the growth was due to Comex.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then if we think about getting back to normal paint volumes in the industry in that kind of 700 million to 750 million gallons area, so that's about a 15% to 20% increase in the volumes from here, regardless of the time frame, but assuming we get there, how should we think about what your SG&A growth to get to that -- or to manage through that kind of level?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think -- and, again, used to be that we used to -- you would see the growth rate. And you can go back to 2002, 2007, see what it grew back in that time frame. And we used to have a dynamic. And I'm thinking that our SG&A used to grow at around 45% to 55% of sales increase.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Volumes or sales, like we were just kind of pulling price out of that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sales.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Sales.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just the last question. On your CapEx guidance of $130 million to $150 million, does any of that include the potential for at least some of the early changes in the Comex stores if -- assuming that you do any of them this year?", "Robert J. Wells", "No. We've kept our guidance -- all our guidance and reporting and so forth Comex-free so that when we do close in a lot of these numbers. And that's one of the numbers that will increase.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "I'll be quick. Just on the same-store sales number that you provided us, Chris, you mentioned the days issue year-over-year. Is that number adjusted 4 days when you guys reported to us?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, that's actual.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. So you're talking about a couple of points higher if it were?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. This 3% -- a little over 3% comp store performance in the face of fewer days.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Got it. Okay. And then when the Comex deal does close, how do you guys expect to communicate some of the numbers to us as far as -- and I guess aside from just updating guidance, is there a way that you're thinking about -- kind of talking about the business or the level of information that you expect to provide on the business to us?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, clearly, on the quarter call, immediately following the transaction, we'll be taking you through a great detail. Sean, do you want to add some color?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We had planned, and if we would have closed before the financial community presentation, it would have been fantastic. We would have taken you through a few more things. There are different requirements when we have to show some of our numbers with the history. And we will -- at that time, you'll see 2012, if we owned it since January 1, 2012, and you'll see the quarters, as well as that year. So -- and then on an ongoing basis, I'm sure that we'll have some type of -- you'll see our sales with and without the acquisition, and we'll show you the EPS effect of that also.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "First of all, on the consumer part of the business, can you give us a little bit more detail between the acquisition component and the FX component -- or, I'm sorry, the price mix component?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I'm sorry...", "Christopher M. Connor", "In consumer, Dmitry?", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Yes. In consumer, you talked about acquisitions having an impact, and then you talked about volumes being down. So I'm just trying to figure out if you have any price mix movement. Or was it flat like it was for the Paint Store Group?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would tell you that we reported that division down 3.7%. Without the acquisition, we would have been down 8.6%. But I would tell you -- on pricing, I would tell you that you look at that, that it was pretty consistent with stores.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Secondly, in your global business, that it's now becoming a more profitable part of the operation and, obviously, that's probably where the most profit improvement in terms of kind of the magnitude in margin improvement opportunity that you have left. Can you talk about the geographic mix of that business right now between Europe, Asia and the Americas? And you talked about the continuing restructuring and some cost actions that you can take in Europe. So we're just -- I'm just trying to understand how relatively sized these businesses are.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. The United States North American component of that segment still exceeds more than 50% of the volume that we generate. Europe would be the second-largest continent of scale. And then Asia Pacific would be the third. And I would say that you kind of step down by half and half again as you go through that analysis.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So something like 30% and 15% or something like 30% and 20%, whatever it works out to be?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Correct. You're close.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Right. And then, finally, you talked about still having a couple of opportunities left to repurchase shares as far as shares outstanding. What's sort of your outlook on the pace of this share repurchase? You talked about dollar cost averaging and being fairly consistent, but your share count has gone up sequentially versus the fourth quarter. So is there an incentive to bring it back down to below 2012 levels?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "When you look at the absolute number, our share count is down. But as the selling -- as the price of our stock continues to go up, we have a dilutive effect on stock options. So over the course of the year, we're going to eliminate that. But we sort of got caught on the price of the stock and so forth. We really don't have -- so I think on a year-to-year basis, you'll see stock options not be dilutive. But I just think that the way the stock price went in the first quarter, it caught us after we were basically in a blackout. And -- but I will tell you, in general, our stock buyback went to the Comex acquisition, it's going to really be [ph] lower than it has been in the last decade on an annualized basis, but it will be enough to make sure that stock options are not dilutive.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of [indiscernible].", "Unknown Analyst", "I just had a quick question on the India market, where you've recently [indiscernible] business to the locals there. You showed [indiscernible] transaction and [indiscernible] behind that strategy in India. That's one of the emerging markets.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think we've commented that the company's strategy going forward is really to be focused on developing the architectural business in the Americas and supporting our industrial coatings businesses around the world. India was a small architectural business that we tiptoed into the country a number of years ago. We made some assumptions about the country's readiness for the type of quality architectural products that we manufacture. Those proved not to be accurate. So after a very short and a very small investment, we decided it was best to pull out and wait for a better day. And we executed a transaction with the Berger Paints company, and we're out of India at this point in time.", "Operator", "Our final question is from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.", "Richard O'Reilly", "I might ask you to repeat yourself on something. But I want to go back to the 2-year trend. And I'm looking at the same stores up 3% versus 20%. That would imply some low double-digit growth rate, something greater than what you would think the market would have supported. What do you think your normal same-store growth should have been or will be if you can exclude all the noise that might be in there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. When we talked, Richard, over a longer cycle of being able to provide guidance by these segments, we said that the Paint Store Group should be a relatively high single-digit revenue performer over the long cycle. And we build that by talking about some pricing, some new store addition, and then comp store performance, which tends to run kind of in the mid-single digits, 4%, 5% range. And we build the rest of that to get to the higher percent. So over a long cycle, when an industry's growing at 1% to 2%, we think this comp store business can grow at a 4% to 5% pace. So clearly, in this environment, when we're having a rebound, we would expect to outperform that. Two things are happening here, not only are the gallons coming back, as we've talked about on this call already, but the mix shift is going back towards the painting contractor, where it had been drifting back towards the DIY, primarily as the new construction markets come back onboard that tend to skew entirely to painting contractors. And that's a good trend for this comp store number as well.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back to Bob Wells for closing comments.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, Robert. I'd just like to close by reminding everyone that our annual financial community presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 23, at our headquarters in Cleveland. The program, as usual, will consist of our customary morning presentation with questions and answers, followed by a reception and lunch. And regardless of the timing of the close of the Comex transaction, we intend to discuss more detail about the strategic fit of this acquisition, more about what the combined organization may look like and our previous experience integrating acquisitions of this type. In addition, we've got lots of other worthwhile information to share, so please join us. If you have not signed up or would like to attend, there's still time.

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's Review of the Second Quarter 2013 Financial Results and Expectations for the Third Quarter and Full Year. With us on today's call are Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO; Sean Hennessy, Senior Vice President, Finance, and CFO; Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller; and Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications.", "This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode via Vcall via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes, and will be available until Wednesday, August 8, 2013, at 5:00 p.m. Eastern time.", "This conference call will include certain forward-looking statements, as defined under U.S. federal securities laws, with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company's earnings release transmitted earlier this morning.", "I will now turn the call over to Chris Connor for some opening comments.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Last night, the Federal Competition Commission in Mexico voted 3 to 2 to withhold approval of our acquisition of Comex announced on November 12, 2012. At this time, we are still reviewing the rationale for the commission's decision, and will respond to those specific concerns in the days ahead. We have several paths forward in our efforts to secure approval for this transaction, including an internal appeal to the Competition Commission, and we are aggressively pursuing these options as we speak.", "Our legal representatives in Mexico are attempting to meet with key commissioners yet today. You may recall that on June 24, we announced an extension of the original purchase agreement out to the end of August. Last evening, and again this morning, I spoke with Marcos Achar, CEO of Comex, and he confirmed their equal resolve to pursue all avenues available to secure confirmation of this transaction. We are clearly disappointed by this decision, but remain resolute in our determination to address their objectives and proceed with the transaction. Obviously, we'll be happy to answer your questions on this topic to the best of our ability after the review of our second quarter results.", "Let me turn the call over now to Bob to walk you through our results for the second quarter, and then I'll be back with concluding comments. Bob?", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, Chris. Summarizing overall company performance for second quarter 2013 versus second quarter 2012. Consolidated net sales increased $140.9 million, or 5.5%, to $2.71 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores Group. Acquisitions added 0.7% to net sales in the quarter, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales by 3/10 of 1% percent. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $83 million over second quarter last year, to $1.23 billion.", "Gross margin increased 80 basis points, to 45.5% of sales from 44.7% in the second quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased 3.3%, to $837.1 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased to 30.8% in the second quarter this year from 31.5% last year.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $15.1 million, an increase of $4.8 million compared to second quarter last year. Other general expense net decreased $2.6 million year-over-year, due primarily to a reduction in provisions for environmental expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $53.1 million, or 16.2%, to $380.9 million.", "Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 32.5%, compared to 30.5% in the second quarter of 2012. For full year 2013, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30% range, compared to last year's rate of 30.4%.", "Consolidated net income increased $29.5 million, or 12.9%, to $257.3 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 9.5% compared to 8.9% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.4%, to $2.46 per share from $2.17 per share in 2012.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Paint Stores Group sales in the second quarter '13 increased 8% to $1.61 billion. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, increased 7%. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Southwestern division, Eastern division and Midwestern division.", "Paint Stores Group segment profit for the quarter increased $66 million, or 24.7%, to $333 million from $267 million in the second quarter last year. Segment margin in the quarter increased to 20.7% from 17.9% last year.", "Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the second quarter decreased 1%, to $393.7 million from $397.7 million last year. Acquisitions increased Consumer segment sales 3.2% in the quarter. Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $1.7 million, or 2.1%, to $79 million in the quarter. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 20.1% from 20.3% in the same period last year.", "For our Global Finishes Group, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 3%, to $513.5 million. Acquisitions increased net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 1.1%, while unfavorable currency translations had minimal impact on sales in the quarter compared to last year. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased 13.4% in the quarter, to $54.5 million from $48 million last year. Acquisitions had no significant effect on segment profits in the quarter, while unfavorable currency translation rate changes reduced segment profit $2.4 million. As a percent to net sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was 10.6% in the quarter, compared to 9.6% last year.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales in U.S. dollars increased 6.3% to $199 million. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased net sales by 2.8% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit in the second quarter decreased to $900,000 from $9.3 million in the same period last year, due primarily to an $11.8 million charge to cost of goods related to an import duly assessment by the Brazilian government for the years 2006 through 2008. This charge was partially offset by selling price increases and higher paint sales volumes.", "Currency translation rate changes had minimal impact on segment profits in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 4/10 of 1% in the quarter, compared to 5% in the second quarter 2012.", "Turning briefly to our balance sheet. Our total debt on June 30, 2013, was $1.68 billion, including short-term borrowings of $50.7 million. Total debt on June 30 last year was $1.24 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $741.1 million, compared to $46.6 million at the end of second quarter 2012. Through the first 6 months of 2013, we spent $72.1 million on capital expenditures. Depreciation expense was $78.3 million and amortization expense was $14.1 million.", "For full year 2013, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $130 million to $150 million, depreciation will be about $150 million, and amortization will be approximately $30 million.", "I'll conclude my remarks on the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. Trial began on Monday, July 15, in the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 cities and counties in California against 5 defendant companies. The judge presiding over the case has limited oral arguments by each side to 40 hours, including live testimony and cross-examination, which should be concluded before Labor Day.", "At the conclusion of the trial, the verdict will be determined by the presiding judge. There is no jury. At this point, we have no indication or sense of timing on a decision.", "That concludes our review of the results for second quarter 2013. So I'll turn the call back over to Chris, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, Bob. We often say that our visibility with respect to end market conditions and input cost trends improved significantly in the second quarter, and this year was no exception. This improving visibility over the past few months has revealed a mixed bag of stable to declining raw material costs, continued strength in the domestic residential market, stagnant nonresidential and industrial activity, all against a backdrop of continued global economic malaise.", "We've felt the effects, both positive and negative, of these disparate market conditions across different geographies and customer segments. I would say, however, that I'm generally pleased with our progress in most aspects of the business, although the second quarter had its normal share of ups and downs.", "On the positive side, our Paint Stores Group continues to perform well. Comp store sales growth at 7% will likely outpace the U.S. architectural paint market in the second quarter, although we continue to see demand disparity across certain customer segments. Residential market demand in both new build and repaint remains very strong in -- even in the month of June. Most of the nonresidential markets, while positive, continue to lag the strength of residential. Protective and marine, for example, a strong category throughout 2012, has softened thus far in 2013.", "Paint Stores segment margin for the quarter improved 280 basis points over the second quarter last year and eclipsed 20% operating margin percent to sales for the first time on record. This margin improvement was evenly divided between gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage.", "Global Finishes Group also made solid progress in the quarter despite the challenging conditions in most geographies outside of North America. Revenue growth in the quarter was aided by an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter last year, but the earnings improvement in the quarter came entirely from the core business. Flow-through on organic revenue growth in the quarter was nearly 65%, with notable improvement in both gross margin and SG&A. Although we're not satisfied with the current pace of revenue growth in this segment, as market conditions improve at home and abroad, Global Finishes Group margins should continue to expand.", "On a less positive note, Consumer segment continues to feel the effect of loss paint businesses at several retail customers, although they've worked hard to mitigate the impact for the lost volume on segment profits. Perhaps the greatest disappointment in our quarter was the $11.8 million charge to our Latin American Coatings Group. The charge is related to our handling of import duties on products brought into Brazil during the years 2006 through 2008. Although we believe our handling of import duties was consistent with a large number of multinationals doing business in Brazil, we elected to accept a voluntary amnesty program offered by the government to resolve this issue rather than encourage significant legal expenses to contest it in court. In 2009, we changed our import duty process. However, the years subsequent to 2008 remain open to audit.", "On the raw material front, it's pretty apparent that the major chloride TiO2 producers were unsuccessful in implementing the price increases announced in the first quarter of 2013 to be effective early in the second quarter. Additional price increases were announced late in the second quarter, with nominal effective dates generally around July 1. The increased plant utilization rates, decreased inventory levels and optimism of a third quarter TiO2 demand were cited as reasons for the increases. However, in all geographic markets, TiO2 pricing held steady in July, and we do not believe that market dynamics will change sufficiently over the balance of the year to justify the implementation of these increases in 2013.", "Although crude oil moved up during the second quarter, propylene, the key feedstock for monomers, latex, solvents and containers, remained relatively stable, and we expect that to continue as well for the balance of the year. With our assumption of stable TiO2 costs and the current pricing of propylene, we expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the paint and coatings industry to be down low-single digits in 2013.", "In the first 6 months of 2013, we've generated $302 million in net operating cash, an increase of $100 million over the first half of 2012. Approximately half of the improvement in net operating cash was from the increase in net income in the quarter, the other half resulting from lower cash required to fund our working capital.", "Working capital, as we measure it, which is receivables plus inventories minus payables, decreased as a percent of sales, to 12% from 12.6% in the second quarter last year. We continue to use the company's cash to purchase shares of our stock for treasury, increase our cash dividend and expand our controlled distribution platform.", "During the quarter, we acquired 800,000 shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our total year-to-date repurchase activity to 1.3 million shares at an average cost of $178.86 per share, and a total investment of $232 million.", "On June 30, we have remaining authorization to acquire 15.2 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, up from $0.39 per share last year. So far this year, our Paint Stores Group has added 22 net new stores, 13 of which were open in the second quarter. This brings our total store count from the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean to 3,542, compared to 3,470 1 year ago. As we commented in April, we are ramping up our new store opening activity, and our Paint Stores Group plans to add approximately 70 to 80 net new store locations during the year.", "Looking ahead, we remain optimistic that U.S. architectural paint market demand, primarily in the residential segments, will remain strong as we go through the prime painting season. Based on this outlook, our expectation for third quarter 2013 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the range of 6% to 9%, compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share, compared to last year's record performance of $2.24 per share.", "For the full year 2013, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2012 by mid-single-digit percentage, with annual sales at that level, we are reaffirming our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $7.45 to $7.55 per share, compared to $6.02 per share earned in 2012.", "Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A couple of questions just on the overall business fundamentals. The volumes for same-store sales kind of number for your Paint Stores was 7%? And I think when you adjust for, kind of Easter falling out of this quarter unlike last year, it looks like it's more like a 5% type number, which seems a little bit lighter than what we would expect given what's going on in the construction market. So I guess, can you walk us through maybe some of the puts and takes that might be driving those volumes maybe coming in a little bit lighter than expected?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, so I'll take a crack at that, John. First of all, I think the 2% impact for Easter might be a little strong for us. It's not that strong of an impact. And we have been commenting about the mix change we've been seeing this year. So our gallon numbers actually were terrific. And it's slightly higher than that sales number that we indicated. We're pretty confident that, that is a, an improvement over what the market ran for the particular quarter. So from our perspective, we see that as a pretty good quarter for the Stores group.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then just one quick question with the regard to the guidance. I mean, you're reaffirming the guidance at this point. Yet, and it sounds like the raw material environment's better than you were originally thinking. So are you starting to give some back, maybe on the pricing side, or are there other kind of puts and takes that we should be thinking about? Is it something around the timing of Comex potentially closing or, I guess, what's the change there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think the guidance reaffirming has a couple of moving parts in it. You're correct, the raw material environment certainly is looking better. But we've also just taken an $0.08 hit relative to this Brazilian tax. So holding the guidance at that level, we think, indicates our confidence in the strength of the second half.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Chris, I was wondering if you can help out on the consumer side. You've referenced losing some business at a few retail customers. I guess we knew Walmart was a prominent one. Could you maybe give us a little color on the others? And then, if we were to take that issue aside, why wasn't there better growth in the consumer, given that, as you said, the residential markets were reasonably hot?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, fair question, Bob. Thanks for the call. We have commented repeatedly about Walmart, as well as, in earlier calls, confirming a Masco comment about the displacement of the Sherwin-Williams Dutch Boy program out of Home Depot, Mexico. As Masco Behr moved that program into that country for the first time. So those are the 2 impacts that we're seeing for the division. And that's had a significant impact. If we back those 2 things out, we're marginally positive there. We have commented for many, many quarters now that this segment has a little bit of a tough road ahead of us, given the strength of the stores organization in the same markets that they're competing with. And for the -- to your comment about rebounding home programs, we made the comment that we were disappointed in the quarter. So we expect this team to do better.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Last quarter, you commented on a big deviation in volumes between external and internal paint. I think a lot of that was weather related. Chris, can you just sort of update us on how that evolved during the second quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, this is Sean Hennessy. The -- when you look at the volumes and that disparage between the exterior and interior that we had, really, because of the exterior first quarter 2012 that we had, very, very strong. As we saw a little more normal, but exterior's still, because of rain, different rain in certain segments. But usually, we don't talk about weather. But because of that, it wasn't all the way back to normal yet on that interior/exterior mix.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, and then just one quick one on Comex, as best as you can answer it. Can you point us towards some other transactions in Mexico that were brought and ultimately went through closed, perhaps some concessions? Do you have a sense of that?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, we don't have any comment regarding those transactions at this point in time.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Chris Nocella with RBC Capital Markets.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can you just give us a sense of how long you think the appeals process could take with Comex? And I see some headlines suggesting accommodation to that market share of maybe 48% to 58%. So can you remind us of your market share in Mexico and maybe what level you think they'd be comfortable with?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, so I can't answer the deal process because it's somewhat perfunctory, Chris. After a verdict like this, the parties have 30 days to issue in a formal appeal. And then once the Chairman of the commission has accepted the appeal, they have 60 days, and those are working days, just to clarify that, to render an opinion on that. It would be inappropriate for us to make any comments relative to what levels of market share the commissions would be interested in seeing.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, does a Comex deal without Mexico make sense? Maybe supplement it with a large share repurchase?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think there are reasons for people to think through that. Our public statements are that we're -- remain committed to completing the full transaction, including both the Canadian, United States and Mexican sides of the deal.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "Starting at the news on Comex, understand your desire to go to the mat to get the deal done, but 2 things in and around that and then a follow-up. One, are you able to kind of buy back stock aggressively or are you kind of in a holding pattern, as that relates, whether it's kind of a quiet period or other things like that? And then, second, how can you make sure that you avoid distraction inside the company, so that if you kind of go at this another couple of quarters or 6 months that it doesn't kind of affect your business in any unintended way? And then I have a follow-up.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. When you think a look at the stack, we are in a blackout. We're in a blackout for 3 days, until 3 days after we've announced, then. We think we'll continue with what we've been doing in the past, but as of today, we can't buy stock today.", "Christopher M. Connor", "In terms of avoiding distraction, Aram, we are the masters at avoiding distraction at Sherwin-Williams. We've had lead lawsuits and all the kinds of noise for -- to contend with. And here, again, we're blessed with really terrific leadership in our field operations. Our folks are out selling paint today and taking care of customers, just like every other day. So while the folks on the phone are spending a little time on this issue, rest assured, the rest of the 40,000 folks are doing what they're supposed to be doing today.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "And just around the California legislation, could you just comment as to whether or not you've reserved differently? The 10-Q usually comments on kind of reserves for environmental, and how you're kind of treating that, and whether or not the prior cases that have been dismissed are fair precedence, or you think this one might be, I don't know, be more unique?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, we think that's fair precedence. You think about Rhode Island and a lot of others. Mississippi, Wisconsin, Ohio, New Jersey. We've never created a reserve for lead lawsuits.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chris, I think you had made a comment in your prepared remarks that your comparable store growth is 7%. Paint Stores' likely outpace the market. So if you can give us a sense of where you think the market is running at the industry level for gallonage? And how much you might be exceeding that pace?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we don't have good visibility into that, Kevin, until several quarters in arrear, when some of the various reporting groups get some data out for us. We have commented that we believe our industry grows at a, historically, in pace with GDP, 1% to 2%. As we rebound to a more normalized architectural coatings demand in our market, we've talked about that running at a little higher pace, let's say, 3%, 4%. We've seen growth for the industry, maybe in the range of 5% here over the last couple of years, as we're seeing some of these rebounding quarters. But, as I mentioned in the first call that John asked, don't forget that our gallon numbers were in excess of that 7% revenue number. So we'll have a better sense here in a little bit. But we're still pretty confident that the teams are doing great in the stores group in terms of taking gallon share.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then a second question, if I may, on the Latin America Coatings Group. I think you had a translation effect there on the top line, but your press release seems to indicate there was no impact on segment profit. I guess it was my understanding you hadn't been hedging and perhaps, you could help me kind of understand how the bottom line would've been insulated in the quarter, given the volatility in the local currency there?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I think we did have debt. I think what we're trying to do, over the years, especially in the last couple of years, is to bring cash forward, allow the debt there to be a natural hedge. And when you look at, really, Brazil is where we were -- really had a major change in that quarter. So we were fairly hedged.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then final question, for Chris, if I may, it is in terms of potential scenarios for redeployment of capital, if indeed Comex ultimately does not go through. Care to offer any comments on what you're seeing in terms of the M&A pipeline? Are there other opportunities that you see out there in the private market that might be appealing alternatives?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Sure, Kevin. I think as deployment of capital goes forward here, regardless of the Comex transaction, frankly, you're going to see Sherwin continue to operate in its traditional fashion. We are not hoarders of cash. We'll put that to work. We're comfortable buying back stock, as we've indicated over the years. There are always M&A opportunities for us. We have a disciplined approach and a strategic list of targets that would be of interest to the company. Your comment about many of them being privately held family businesses dictates it's on a certain path in order to try to get those to market. And those conversations have been happening in this environment and will continue to happen. Nothing new to report at this time.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Question on the actual timing of the Comex response, I guess, from the Mexican government. It seems like it, given the amount of time that they have to respond, it wouldn't be until late in the fourth quarter. So is there any reason that they might -- you might be able to accelerate that, so you get a little bit better clarity sooner?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, Nils, our intent will be absolutely to accelerate. And we're approaching this with speed and urgency. It would be premature for me to comment, because I simply don't know how quickly we can get them to engage in what that outcome might be.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Understood. In terms of, then, in Latin America, it seems like the second quarter has been a bit of a dip in the last 2 years. Is there anything changing in terms of seasonality or product mix that's causing that from the operating profit perspective?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We continue to do a lot of different things in Latin America. In fact, we just did a major IT project down there. And Oracle was now turned on in Argentina on the third of July. So we've been doing a lot of different things in the last couple of years. We'll keep moving on that project. We think that, that project's going to help us with working capital and reducing the working capital as a percent of sales. And I think you're right about the second quarter, because if you look at the year-to-date, last year, our ROS in that segment was 7.4% through the first 6 months and the first 2 quarters. This year, with the adjusted, if you add back the Brazilian import situation, we're at 8.2%. And we look at our forecast for the year, and, I'll just tell you, we think that we still see us improving and moving forward on ROS improvement for the year.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And just a final one, if I may. Does it -- when you look at some of what the competitors have put out there in terms of their growth rate in Latin America, it seems like you're doing a little bit better. Are there -- is there any share shifts going on? Or is it just not really comparable?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think if there are share shifts, they're minimal at best at this point in time.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citigroup.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Chris, you didn't mention weather and the wet spring, which would have impacted at least your Exterior Paint business. Did you make up any of the losses in June as the weather improved?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Okay. I think on the call, PJ, we made the comment that we'd seen strength in the residential markets, and including, during the month of June, there was a lot of noise in the market relative to other impacts to the demand curve there. As Sean said in I think, in one of his answers, we're not ones for giving weather reports on these calls. We expect to have weather issues in various parts of the geography at all quarters, frankly. And so the health and robustness of the residential markets, both new and repaint, are really the core thing that we're looking at and providing confidence on. And we expect that over a cycle, weather will not be that big of an impact.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And, Chris, you talked about some pricing pressure in big commercial projects during the last call. Can you tell us if that is continuing? And if commercial is weak to get to 7% same-store growth, was residential up double digits?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, on both recounts. Commercial bidding activity, in an environment like this, where folks are going aggressively after gallons, has always been tough in an environment. With moderating raw materials, we expect to see it even more so, and that's been the case. And then on your analysis on the residential impact being double-digits is also accurate.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And just quickly, have you seen any impact from paint geared towards contractors launched at Lowe's [ph] ?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, we have not. I don't think that program's been out there long enough to get any indication of the impact it might have.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fisher with Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to talk to the incremental margin in the Paint Store business jumped really strong this quarter, up over 50%, where it had kind of been 38% in the first quarter. Can you walk through the buckets of what improved so well in that business, as far as profitability relative to sales growth?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I would tell you, #1, we're starting to see SG&A improvement. I know that in the first quarter, we had mentioned that in the first quarter 2012, that sales were so strong, we did not get all the SG&A service dollars into that first quarter that we should have had. And we had to go against that history in the first quarter of this year. And remember, at the end of the first quarter, we said, hang in there because we thought that we would be flat to down slightly year-to-date in SG&A, which we finally did. But as those gallons go through the stores, this is the piece where we really feel good about our flow-through. And I think that it was just gallons, gallons going through, but that's G&A leverage. And that's what -- that's really what created it.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. So that feels like a good, solid margin, that above 20% is a good baseline as you would look at it and others see seasonality with it, but there is nothing -- okay, terrific.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, we think that's in the first and the fourth quarter, and I...", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes, fair enough. And then, when you look at your business and the Comex business in Mexico, not so much around the deal, but we've certainly got a lot of bad macro news flows about the housing market down there and financing for housing. How would you handicap the health of the coatings market going into that today versus if you think about when you would have announced the deal?", "Christopher M. Connor", "It's clearly softer, Duffy, specifically around the impacts that you've mentioned. The government has redirected some of their support for various housing programs. And that's had an impact on some of the large homebuilders in the region. So we have felt that in our business moderately, and I would suspect Comex has as well.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, and then just one last question on Comex, in particular. I remember, Chris, you talking about one of the really strong points of the Comex business was just the density that they had. And if one of the fixes, and, again, this is a little bit of a speculation, but if one of the fixes that the government would ask for is the divestiture of some of the points of sale, is that a linear line? Or is there something asymmetric there, where the business starts to lose some of its attractiveness pretty quickly if you had to divest some stuff?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, first of all, their business model is through an independent concessionario, 3,300 of these other Mexican businesses which operate these facilities. They're not owned by the Comex company themselves. so that in and of itself may not be the solution. And again, as we've commented earlier, all those types of potential outcomes are just purely speculative at this point in time, and we prefer to wait and work through the normal channels here.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "First, on the gross margin expansion. Could you help us with how much of it was due to manufacturing leverage, with the gallons coming through versus the price of raw material mix dynamic?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would say that the gallons coming through our plants, when you look at the -- I'll just go to the very -- the 45% versus the 43.8% on a year-to-date basis. Really, the majority of it was just the strong sales, the incremental sales. I would say the incremental gallons and incremental sales are really the -- they've created that gross margin, not selling price.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, so and then, I guess, that ties into the next, okay. If gallons are up 8, current resi, stronger than commercial, how should we think about the 8 versus the 7 in terms of that price, it's basically just all mix? And is it mix within those different categories, or just mix between the 2?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would say mix within category, yes.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then, lastly, you guided to a 6% to 9% growth number for the third quarter. I guess, what's sort of taking that acceleration? Is there something, easier compares or do you see anything specific in terms of orders or customer dynamic to give you that confidence?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, I think if you look at it, we think we're fine. I think the third quarter's looking a little stronger. But I wouldn't say that our sales in the second quarter versus 6% to 9% is that dramatically different, right? I think we're going to be fine.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, Chris, and I realized you can't say much on Comex, but, just to make sure I got the timing right. You said the -- you've already extended the merger agreement to the end of August. Would you expect to extend that again in the near term to give yourself more time, given the 30-day for a formal peer and 60-day review?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, it's premature to comment on that at this point in time, Greg. I'm sorry.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "In the Global Finishes segment, were there similarities or differences between Auto Refinish and other businesses, like Product Finishes? I would have thought you might be seeing some benefit from the Exalta situation, that the 2 businesses might have to converged within that segment?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think that when you look at the Automotive, we had Pulanna, which was an acquisition. So the Automotive piece was the strongest of the 3 pieces, with or without the acquisition.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And was there material spending in the quarter on the Comex deal in your SG&A?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "$0.01 to $0.02 a share.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "With some insight into where raw material costs are at this point, as you'd indicated, as you think about the map or the path on gross margin from here. I'm wondering if you can just give us some of your thoughts and strategy and thinking on where that goes?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, and I think when you look at the gross margins, for the first half of the year, we were at 45. I think that without the Brazilian situation that we spoke of, that 45.2%. And we've continually said we're in that 43% to 46% range. And I would expect that our gross margin will come in between that 45% and 46% range for the year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "There's been some discussion in the past of the range potentially being better in this cycle. I'm wondering as you think of the structural issues going on with input cost and also where we are in terms of volume and leverage, how do you think about doing better than that 43% to 46% range over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think that over this period, I think, as we've commented in the past, we've always believed that eventually, we'd be at 44% to 47%, potentially, 45% to 48%. I think that, right now, it'd be premature. One of the things that we are sort of waiting to see is, after the Comex closes, to really show the combined gross margin it would be an effect in the short run. And we think it changes our long-term goal. So I think if that -- when that occurs, I think we'd be in a lot better shape to give you some updated numbers.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "In terms of, related to this, secondly, in terms of the benefit from the input costs, looking at better revenue growth than the quite incremental margin in the back half of the year, should the profitability progress of the first half be sustained or improved in the back half? How should that look as we work through the second half?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, when you look at the first 6 months, I think that we're at 3 57 versus 3 13 at $0.44. The mid-point of our range is $1, and I'll tell you that we're going to have to have a higher flow-through in this improvement in the third and fourth quarter than we'd had in the first 2 quarters.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then, secondly, as it relates to the Comex.", "I'm just curious what color you can give us on your interactions with the commission prior to last evening's decision from them? If you could just shed some light on the interactions, the questions they've asked and sort of given your response to the decision last night, relative to those interactions?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Sure, just briefly, Eric, on that point. We've been represented by outside counsel in Mexico City, who specializes in working with this commission. They have had appropriate meetings with the commissioners during the process. Several of our management team has been able to participate in those discussions to help clarify points, provide data, et cetera. And so I would characterize that as being open and appropriate conversations.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Was that a surprise last night, relative to the sort of candor and tone of those discussions?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I'd be careful to not particularly use that word surprised. I think we'll just leave it at disappointment.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Chris, just to clarify or maybe expand a little bit on that, the last question. So can you talk at all, even high level, on some of the points of contention that the commission raised, things that you have to go back and look at or address just to understand what are the dynamics that the commission is focused on?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Dennis, as we commented, we got this report late last night. It was 144 pages in Spanish. We are going through that in great detail at this moment. I think it just would be premature to comment at this time, unfortunately.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Come on, Chris. You got to bone up on your Spanish. Okay, that's fair. On the business side, within same stores, can you just maybe comment a little bit more on what's driving the mix and whether that's a temporary dynamic within some of the categories or if that's the exterior/interior dynamic and how that plays out as you kind of normalize out weather?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, I think we've mentioned it before. I think residential's been tremendously stronger than commercial. And I think that new residential has been fairly strong. So when you look at those 2 pieces, that's really what's been driving it.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "You're seeing the gallon, the gallon mix on the residential price is lower than non-res? Or just new construction?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "New construction, in general, is usually a lower average selling price. As that continues to become a higher percentage of our sales, that drives gallons faster than sales.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. And then is there a...", "Robert J. Wells", "I'm sorry, this is Bob. There is also still a slight interior-to-exterior mix difference relative to last year. Although it's what Sean said, the new construction, plus an interior-to-exterior mix difference.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "And is there a similar negative drag on the margin line?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, the operating margins are strong.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "All right. Well, I know that they're strong, Sean, but I'm just asking is there a drag on that or is it just the top line drag?", "Robert J. Wells", "No, we've talked for a long time, Dennis, about the consistency of the platform for products and assessments we're in. So we're fine in that regard.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First, I just want to clarify that the new EPS or the new unchanged EPS guidance, does that include the $0.08 Brazilian duty expense?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Is that another way you would have been raising guidance if that -- if we hadn't run into that issue?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We've got a dime range, and it's only $0.08. So it's in there.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "All right. Well, okay. And then, secondly, just again to clarify the comments you made about the Mexican housing market getting softer versus when the Comex deal was announced, can you just clarify the original arrangement had -- just, does it have a price adjustment if there is a material change in that market and the performance, because now we're talking with the range that you gave, about 1 year going by just before the potential closing?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "As we continue to do the due diligence and the market has changed, there's other things that have not changed, and some other things that have gotten stronger. We continue to look at the pro forma. We look at what our -- what we expect to get a return on our assets that we put into this and the internal rate of return. And we don't have an automatic adjustment for the market conditions. I think that, as we've gone through, I think we're still, if this closes any time soon, even with the, in our mind, short-term market changes in Mexico, we think this is going to create nice shareholder value.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then lastly, just 2 housekeeping questions. One, your administrative expense, excluding the change in interest expense, seems to be down in the first half of the year. Do you expect that to continue to be down in second half? Or should we think about that going back up? And...", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, I think -- oh, I'm sorry, go ahead.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "No, no, go ahead. I'm going to ask the second one afterwards.", "Christopher M. Connor", "I would say that we expect, even without the SG&A from the interest expense, the way you were referring to that question, we think that, that expense will be up slightly in the year. We just think there were some timing \u2013 and, again, we have some -- a couple IT projects that we're going to be working on in that -- in admin, also.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, and then, lastly, if you could just give the gross profit change by segment, if you could just...", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. I got it. Gross profit change by Store group, $83 million. Consumer Group was down $400,000. Global Finishes, $8.6 million improvement. And Latin America is down $9.2 million. And I just want to remind you, that $9.2 million is -- that's where the $11.8 million was expensed as the cost of goods sold.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Real quick. The residential recovery's been going on for a while now, and I understand nonresidential tends to lag, it's historically lagged. Is this lag lasting a little bit longer than you would have expected? Or is this sort of in line with expectations? And how would you sort of gauge your outlook for nonresidential, based off of, I guess, historic trends?", "Robert J. Wells", "Ivan, this is Bob. I think what we're seeing is that there are certain categories of nonresidential that has been real slow to start. And that's not unexpected. Retail was severely overbuilt during the last run-up. We're seeing solid construction activity in multi-family housing. We're seeing a pickup in office. Some of the institutional categories, specifically schools and government buildings, have been slow to start. So it's choppy across subcategories in the nonresidential market. But I think most of the nonresidential market is starting to pick up as expected. As a reminder, we do expect positive overall nonresidential volume this year in terms of square footage put in place.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then, for the Mexican market, if you could you remind me, what is the breakdown between, I guess, the total volumes in housing, new construction and repaint? And how much do the builders -- do they dominate, the large builders, dominate the new construction in Mexico? How does that market sort of -- I mean, how do gallons break out, I guess...", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, it would be very similar to the United States architectural business model that we've commented on for a long period of time. The vast majority of coatings in Mexico are to maintain and decorate existing structures. New construction totally would be in that 25% range, plus or minus a little bit. There are large Mexican homebuilders, but there are hundreds if not thousands of other independent builders as well, too. So you can pretty much apply the same kind of modeling to the U.S. market that we've commented on and share with you a long period of time to Mexico.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then my last question. On the Brazilian market, there's been a lot of uncertainty. Does that continue to -- what are you seeing in terms of your business on there? It looks like your results remain fairly strong.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think there has been some noise surrounding Brazil's overall economic environment. We've had some segments that have been a little bit harder hit. Don't forget that one of the things that Brazil has in its future is hosting this World Cup and the Olympics. And the construction is build out of the required stadiums, airport expansion and housing, all areas where it would impact our business. So that's a little bit behind schedule. But some of our strength is relative to the work we've seen happening in that space so far.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Chris, a question on your ability to outsustain or outperform industry growth. You're growing 7%, industry's 3% to 4%. How much of that, do you think, is due to your stronger position in new home construction because of your relationships with the top homebuilders? And how much is -- would be repaint, where you're just seeing a swing back to contractors?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Clearly, Don, as this rebound is occurring, we've commented about the emerging importance of the professional painting contractor. They have they've troughed a little bit during the downturn. And we expect that we're on our way back to about a 60-40 mix, where 60% of all the coatings will be purchased by professional painting contractors. Clearly, the new residential construction market, in terms of -- and all new construction. Bob just commented briefly on multifamily also being a strong, new segment as well, so we're getting a lift from that, and we'd expect that to continue.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And on the last call, part of your confidence in the outlook for the year was just the backlog that your contactor customer base had. How is that looking? Are they still relatively confident in the business outlook? And the other comment you made is that weather doesn't create or destroy demand for paint. It just defers it or accelerates it. So, this adverse weather that we saw in the second quarter, does that just push out demand into the third quarter or is lost for the year as a whole?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I would say you're accurate with all of your questions there. We would expect that the contractors book of business looks robust. Sean just commented on the third quarter sales guidance being a little bit stronger even in our second quarter. As we meet with these folks on a daily basis through our stores, they're continuing to give us indications. They've got a good book of business. And to your point about weather just moving demand back, none of these folks are commenting about the impact of weather. They're continuing to be on projects and expect that they're going to have a pretty solid second half as well.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "It sounds like from your comments, that your commentary on raw material expectations seems to be a little bit better than it was earlier in the year. I think there was some concern about second half of the year seeing some inflation in the petrochemical side of raw materials, at least. Now you're looking at it being flat and TiO2, obviously, is flat and down year-over-year. Your guidance was basically flat versus your previous expectations. So is raw material improvement, if it is there, just not significant enough? Or was this basically the $0.08 penalty from Brazil that prevented you from raising guidance on a little bit more robust outlook for cost? Or is there some other, sort of cautionary things that you're seeing in the market in the back end of the year that you would rather keep the powder dry as far as your expectations are concerned?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, on the raw material factor, Dmitry, there's obviously, there's a lot of moving parts. We believe that the TiO2 producers were going to push pricing hard, beginning in the second quarter, and they have. We weren't sure whether market conditions would be such that they'd actually realize some of the pricing that they were pushing. Our outlook, our point of view now is that market conditions will not accommodate a price increase or any effective pricing in TiO2. We weren't sure whether propylene would remain stable. It appears to be holding pretty steady, despite the run-up in crude oil. So I would say that, to Chris' opening comments, there's a lot more clarity now than there was 3 months ago. I wouldn't characterize, on the total raw material basket outlook for the industry, as far better today than it was 3 months ago. It's maybe, marginally better.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then we're in our third year of negative volume comps on the consumer line or in consumer division. Obviously, in 2011, it was -- the majority of that was Walmart loss and then, I guess, a little bit of that spilled over into 2012. And now we have the Mexican Home Depot issues with Masco replacing Dutch Boy. When are we going to -- or when do you think you're going to anniversary that, and we actually get to see sort of the clean performance of the consumer group and hopefully, positive numbers [ph]?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, the other thing, just to make sure that -- you did a nice job of presenting the history, but you have to remember that when we did do the Walmart deal, when that Walmart deal was the major hit and last, at the end of the third quarter last year, we had another step down. And that's what we're anniversary-ing. So on the last call, again, Masco put it out there. In the fourth quarter of last year, and they -- we had that Mexican Dutch Boy will convert to Behr. So when you take with the last quarter, we said that, really, we were going to see negative through the third quarter. Then after the third quarter, we'd expect that we'd start to see some improvement there. So I think we answered it that way after the first quarter, and we feel pretty good about that answer. I wouldn't change it.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, so fourth quarter, we should start seeing more apples-to-apples type of comparisons anniversary-ing all the headwinds as far as business losses?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Chase.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "In terms of the-- are you -- do you continue to be optimistic about the Comex transaction? Because, at worst, you could divest your own Mexican business and own their much, much larger Mexican business? And did you offer them -- did you offer the commission any remedies so far, or remedies have not been discussed yet?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, Jeff, we'll always squeeze you in, first of all, so thanks for being on the call. And secondarily, those are all appropriate thoughts and ideas and questions for you to ask. And equally as appropriate, I cannot comment on any of that at this point in time.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, and then lastly, sequentially, did your prices change either positively or negatively in your stores and in your consumer business?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, not at all. I think when you look at the second quarter versus the first quarter, it's been over 12 months since we've had the last price increase. And the selling prices are not dramatically different.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Are you allowed to say whether you're optimistic or pessimistic about the closing of the Comex transaction?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Jeff, we're optimistic by nature here, and I think the comments we gave early on about the multiple paths we have to continue pushing forward here, we're hopeful that we'll get this done.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Aram Rubinson with Nomura Securities.", "Aram Rubinson - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "While I'm at it, can you talk about both the promotional environment and maybe the cadence of comps by range? Because I think by region, you mentioned there was a big range, and I was just curious to how wide a range there was by region?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, so the promotional activity, Aram, has been very consistent in our industry pretty, much for decades on end now. This is the time of year when you'll see discounting by all the major retailers, including Sherwin-Williams, to drive traffic into stores around the big peak holiday seasons, and, certainly, July 4 qualifies as one of those. Bob did comment briefly about our Southeastern division leading the pack, Southwestern division second, then Eastern and Midwestern. All of them solidly in the mid-single digits and above range. The range was not very wide.", "Operator", "Our next question is a question coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Can you remind me or us, we had the volumes in the -- are the volumes for the Paint Stores made in the Consumer Group, or is it the other way around?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, the product that is sold through Stores Group is produced in the Consumer Group. So the Consumer Group is making product for sales of the Consumer Group, as well as the Paint Stores Group. So they also handle the logistics and warehousing.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay. So the consumer margin is down only a couple of percentage point -- basis points, even though the sales are down because the Paint Stores Group volumes were up so well. Is that how I should be thinking about it?", "Christopher M. Connor", "They definitely get a positive impact, yes, from having the Paint Stores Group improving volume.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay. And then a second question, if I can. Following up on the raw materials, I think you had said you saw your -- the overall basket now down low single digits. And we know about pigments. And propylene, at least, is down from the first quarter levels. What else in that basket is up or down noticeably? I mean, is packaging, or is distribution in there? What else can you comment on?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Richard, distribution is not in there. But we tend to comment on propylene and TiO2, because TiO2 represents the vast majority of the pigment category. And propylene affects about -- the cost of about 60% of the raw material basket by cost. So we find propylene to be a good proxy for most of the rest of the basket outside of pigments. There is some movement in various specific solvents that we don't tend to delve into. But for the most part, packaging, latex and resins, and most of the base load solvents are holding pretty steady.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of JD Punjabi with Very.", "Unknown Analyst", "Just -- can you give us a little bit more color on what's going on in the Marine and Protective market? Why is it we can actually -- when you expect things to turn around there? And also, if you can provide a little bit more color on some of the other industrial coating markets, that will be great.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So the Marine market, Protective and Marine markets, for us, predominantly, as we've commented through our Global Group businesses, is a North American business. So we have a terrific share position in the United States, on a variety of different end segments here. I think Bob also commented about just some of the softness that we're seeing in the nonresidential sector of the economy, and, frankly, that's almost totally where the Protective and Marine business resides. Our segments would include there Bridge and Highway, petrochemical, wastewater treatment, energy, food and beverage. The military's an important component of that. Or, better said, the government is an important component of that. So sequesters have a little bit of an impact here as well. The good news for this business for us has always been that this is one of these types of painting projects that you can't defer maintenance for long. And so we think there's been just a slowing of it, a little bit, over this last quarter. And discussing the projects that we see on the books and with our contractors who work in this space, they're confident that the second half of the year will be better for them, and we'd expect to report that going forward.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any concluding comments.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, Jesse. As always, I will be available for the balance of the day, tomorrow and throughout the coming week to answer your follow-up questions. I appreciate your patience if you're in the queue now. And, again, thanks for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Welcome to the Valspar Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Tyler Treat, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Tyler N. Treat", "Good morning. Welcome to our Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. We have 2 speakers today who will provide insight on our business and the third quarter results we announced this morning: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, Valspar's Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valsparglobal.com.", "And finally, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or the GAAP numbers we will report on our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Hendrickson.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Thank you, Tyler, and good morning, everyone. Our results in the third quarter continue to reflect the mixed environment that our customers and Valspar have experienced this year in a couple of our key product lines in international regions. I'll focus on the areas of the company that are performing well and provide a progress update on several of our key growth initiatives. In addition, I'll provide perspective on the areas where we're falling short of our near-term plans.", "We increased sales and continued to deliver very strong volume growth in the third quarter. Sales in the U.S. market have been solid all year and this quarter was no exception. Sales were up mid-single-digits and volumes were up double-digits. The increase was driven by strength in our consumer, packaging, coil and wood product lines. The growth we are seeing in the U.S. is a reflection of the improving strength of the residential housing market and construction spending, coupled with our new business wins.", "In contrast to the U.S., sales in the international regions have been challenged all year long. While our sales in the third quarter did improve sequentially from the second quarter in Europe and Asia, all of our international regions were below our expectations due to weak end market conditions. Our global general industrial product line remained weak in the quarter. We saw particularly soft customer orders in the global off-road equipment market as some of our largest customers lowered inventory levels, which compounded already weak end market conditions. In addition, the China shipping container market is operating at only a fraction of last year's rates. These were 2 of the major factors why our international results were below our plans.", "In Australia, our paint business continues to be negatively impacted by a very soft residential housing market. Though we did see some improvement in our stores business in the quarter, it was not of the pace we had originally anticipated. With results for the third quarter short of expectations, we have lowered our expected sales growth rate and earnings outlook for the year to account for a near-term continuation of these trends. As a large portion of the earnings shortfall is from the international regions, the geographic change in the mix of earnings will also increase the company's tax rate for the year. We now expect annual EPS in the range of $3.45 to $3.55. This range contemplates a mid-single-digit sales growth rate in the fourth quarter, excluding the Inver acquisition, and will provide good momentum heading into fiscal 2014.", "I believe that composition of our geographic performance this year has been largely consistent with the broader market. I remain extremely confident that Valspar is well-positioned for the long term, with profitable growth opportunities in each of our core businesses. And upon the eventual recovery in these international markets, as well as the general industrial market, we expect to gain leverage from our excellent positioning. I think it's important for our investors and employees to know that while we are very confident in our long-term prospects, we also expect the company to deliver on its short-term financial commitments. I am not satisfied with our updated performance expectations for this year, especially given our track record of very strong performance over the last several years.", "That being said, there are many important indicators that we are continuing to make progress on our growth plans. Perhaps most pleasing is that we once again delivered on our net new business targets in the quarter, with mid-single-digit sales growth in both our Coatings and Paints segments. In our Paints segment, we have previously spoken about our long-term growth initiatives that will generate approximately $400 million in new sales when fully implemented in 2015. Let me provide a brief update on these and some other initiatives.", "North America consumer paints continues to perform well. In the third quarter, without including the professional paint line, we saw a mid-single-digit sales increase of Valspar paint in the big box channel. Our expanded professional paint program has now been in Lowe's stores for a full quarter and we are pleased with the early results.", "The rollout of our new Private Label and branded programs with Ace Hardware are on plan. We will start shipping Valspar-branded paints to Ace during the fourth quarter and we are currently tracking ahead of our internal placement targets for this initiative. Valspar paint is currently set and performing well in 30 B&Q stores in the U.K., and the rollout of the full program is accelerating as we move toward the end of this calendar year. We expect the rollout to be completed in early 2014, when Valspar will be the flagship paint brand in all 350 B&Q stores in the U.K.", "In China, our Huarun business had a good quarter with mid-single-digit volume growth. Our product line for the affordable housing market continues to do well and we have expanded the program to include a decorative wood coatings product and initial market reaction has been positive. We're also executing successful new business initiatives in our Coatings segment. Volumes in our packaging product line increased just over 10% in the quarter and have increased high single-digits year-to-date as we continue to win new business. A large driver of this new business is our industry-leading position in non-BPA coatings. We are converting existing customers and winning new business with new technology. Sales of our non-BPA products are up more than 20% year-over-year and we are positioned to capture additional share as the market for this product line continues to grow.", "We are also very pleased with the momentum of our wood and coil product lines during the quarter. We benefited from new business wins, as well as improved market conditions in the U.S., and these product lines are having a great year. As I said earlier, some of our general industrial product lines are experiencing challenging market conditions and cyclical trends, but on the whole, general industrial coatings is a large and profitable business for us.", "To further strengthen our position in the general industrial business, earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of Inver Group, a leading industrial coatings manufacturer in Europe. This is an outstanding strategic fit for Valspar as Inver complements our existing global general industrial business and fits well in our strategy to expand our presence in Europe. The industrial coatings market in Europe is estimated to be a $6 billion market that remains very fragmented. These dynamics provide a great opportunity for growth.", "Inver specializes in liquid and powder coatings for off-road equipment, truck chassis, railways and trams. Inver also has a very strong small customer distribution model. Inver's supply chain operations are complementary to Valspar's and will allow us to realize significant operational synergies. Inver has an exceptional leadership team, with a proven record of focusing on customers and delivering results, so the cultural fit with Valspar is excellent. The Inver team has grown through the recession in Europe, while also becoming more profitable. Inver's CEO, Giovanni Domenichini, will lead Valspar and Inver's combined industrial business in Europe. Giovanni and his team are already well underway in executing our integration plans.", "In summary, while our results this quarter were below expectations, the good news for long-term investors in Valspar is that our new business programs are on target. Our long-term growth initiatives are delivering against our expectations and our net new business this year is in line with our goals. When combined with our previously announced restructuring actions and the acquisition of Inver, we have a great foundation on which to deliver a good year in 2014.", "And now I'll turn the call over to Jim who will provide some additional context on our results.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Thanks, Gary, and good morning. Consistent with the approach on last quarter's call, my focus this morning will be on the key business drivers and performance metrics related to our third quarter results. I will also cover the drivers behind the updated outlook on the fiscal year. As always, you'll have the opportunity to follow up with Tyler after the call with detailed financial modeling questions. Before we move into the third quarter results, I thought it would be helpful if I first step back and reviewed what we set out to accomplish this year and the key themes that have played out year-to-date.", "As you know, Valspar's performance over the past several years has been extremely strong. In fact, the company is coming off record results last year, where sales reached $4 billion and EPS improved 24%, driven by improved volumes and industry-leading margins, strong operating income growth and continued benefits from share repurchases. The big drivers behind this performance included significant sales and margin growth in paints, packaging, coil, wood and general industrial product lines, driven by solid end market demand, strong new business wins, pricing discipline and market share gains. We also saw a strong performance from China consumer paints in 2012. In a market where residential construction was down significantly, we generated double-digit volume in the year. We realized benefits from restructuring actions taken to improve performance, exiting a number of unprofitable product lines and customers in the industrial segment. These actions drove very strong EBIT growth in our Coatings segment.", "Coming out of 2012, the strategic opportunities we saw for long-term growth in our key businesses supported by strong historical financial results provided the baseline for our expectations at the beginning of this fiscal year. In fiscal 2013, we set our plans to continue growing Valspar by winning new customers in each of our key businesses. While some of these activities would require front-end investments, we knew that they would provide profitable additions to our business. At the outset of the year, our plans also assumed stable end markets in our key industrial segments. We also expected that several of our key international markets, specifically China and Australia, would experience some level of improvement as the year progressed.", "Looking at our year-to-date performance, we have experienced mixed results against these plans. However, 2 key perspectives are important to understand when evaluating the areas where we have underperformed against our expectations. First, the softness in our year-to-date results compared to our plan is primarily driven by lower demand in key end markets. Overall, we continue to gain market share and our results are in line with the performance of our customers.", "Second, the long-term expectations we have for the business segments and markets, which are currently challenged, remain strong. Many of the trends in the key end markets and geographies are more temporal in nature and our long-term investment thesis remains intact. This is especially true in the general industrial segment and the long-term potential for countries like China. With these 2 perspectives as context, I will summarize our year-to-date performance under a couple of themes.", "First, business in our largest and most profitable market, the U.S., has been very strong. Year-to-date, we have grown volumes, sales and profits, driven by gains in consumer paints, wood, coil and packaging product lines. The only significant exception to this trend in the U.S. has been the general industrial business, which I'll speak to in a minute. And second, we are winning new customers across each of our key businesses. The consumer paint business delivered big wins with the addition of the Lowe's Professional Paint line, Ace and B&Q. Our packaging, general industrial coil and wood product lines have also grown new business this year. Year-to-date, these activities have driven high single-digit volume growth.", "The headwinds this year have primarily come from weak demand in global industrial markets, lower growth in China and continued softness in Europe and Australia. As discussed previously, the general industrial business is experiencing challenging end market demand after posting very strong results last year. Similar to the comments you may have seen from some of our customers, reduced global demand in heavy equipment purchases, coupled with customer actions to reduce inventories, has significantly impacted volumes in this market. Our volumes in general industrial coatings are down high single-digits after being up high single-digits in the same period last year. We are seeing a similar situation in our pipe coatings products where delayed projects in the U.S. have impacted volumes this year. While we continue to view both of these markets as very attractive for future growth, they weigh on the current overall performance of the company.", "Our performance in the international markets is also providing a headwind. While markets like China and Europe provide us a great foundation for future growth, our results reflect the demand softness experienced by our customers, primarily in the industrial product lines. Sequentially, these regions improved in sales in the third quarter, but not to the levels we had expected. In Australia, we continue to see a weak residential housing market. Though we have seen some sequential improvement in volumes and sales in Australia, our recovery of previously lost stores business is lower than we had planned.", "Despite the near-term challenges in the general industrial market and international geographies, Valspar's year-to-date volumes are up 6% and sales are flat. Operating income has increased 3% and operating margins expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Our year-to-date results in the U.S. are much stronger across each of these metrics. Our year-to-date performance in the general industrial and international regions, coupled with our expectations for the balance of this fiscal year, were the key drivers behind our lower sales and EPS outlook for fiscal 2013.", "Turning back now to the third quarter results and outlook. The performance trends we experienced were largely similar to the items I just reviewed. Third quarter volumes increased in both the Paints and Coatings segments. Volume increased 7%, led by very strong performance in the Paints segment, especially in the U.S. and China. Volumes in the Coatings segment also increased and improved sequentially, driven by continued strength in our packaging, wood and coil product lines, partially offset by the softness in the general industrial product line.", "Total sales in the quarter were up 1%, which was a slight improvement from the second quarter. Sales growth was driven by volume improvement, offset by a sales mix shift to new business which has lower average selling prices. Pricing was basically flat in the quarter. The gross margin rate in the third quarter finished at 34.1%, down 10 basis points from last year. These results were in line with our plans for the quarter.", "We continue to manage expenses, balancing current market conditions with investments required for future growth. Operating expenses in the third quarter declined 3% as a result of productivity improvements and lower incentive compensation, which more than offset continued investments in programs for growth, like Lowe's Pro, new business wins in packaging, Ace and the launch of Valspar Paint at B&Q. Bringing it all together, third quarter EBIT grew 5%, and EBIT margins improved 60 basis points from last year.", "From a segment perspective, EBIT margins in Paints declined 40 basis points to 11.5% versus last year, largely due to the addition of the Ace Private Label volume. In the Coatings segment, EBIT margins were 17.6%, an increase of approximately 40 basis points, primarily driven by productivity gains.", "Gary has already covered the key strategic opportunities related to the Inver acquisition. This acquisition also provides us the opportunity to improve our profitability and we will be restructuring our operations in Europe to leverage the combined footprint of Valspar and Inver. Similar to the North American-focused restructuring actions we have taken this year, these initiatives will provide a more profitable business going forward. We expect to incur additional restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter and in fiscal 2014 related to these restructuring activities. We will provide more details in the future as we finalize these plans.", "Given our purchase price of approximately 1x Inver sales and based on the acquisition synergies, we expect the addition of Inver and our European restructuring activities will be accretive to fiscal 2014 EPS by approximately $0.10. As I mentioned earlier, the reduction in our fiscal 2013 guidance is primarily driven by lower sales expectations in general industrial products and macroeconomic headwinds in our international geographies. In addition, a portion of the shortfall is resulting from reduced performance in lower tax jurisdictions.", "Our annual guidance includes adjusted EPS of $3.45 to $3.55. Key assumptions behind this include: Sales growth in the fourth quarter of mid to high-single digits, driven by new business, particularly in our Paints segment and the acquisition of Inver, which will add approximately 2% growth; overall EBIT margin expansion, driven by leverage from growth initiatives, lower incentive compensation, somewhat offset by the dilutive mix impact of Inver; an updated annual tax rate of approximately 32.5%, as a portion of our lower profit expectations are from international regions. This will result in a higher effective tax rate for the year, given the lower tax rate in these jurisdictions.", "In closing, we are very encouraged by the growth initiatives we have in place. We have a portfolio of businesses that are well-positioned for the future and we remain focused on driving profitable growth and returns for our shareholders.", "With that, we'd like to open up the call and take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And first in line, Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "A couple of questions. I'm just trying to understand sort of the shortfall in revenue that you expect versus your expectations and the impact that's having on the bottom line. A $0.20 reduction in mean midpoint of the guidance, which basically means all of it is going to happen in the fourth quarter, implies that there is some margin issues added and that this goes beyond the top line. So can you go through sort of the genesis of sequentially lower EPS that you expect in the fourth quarter, at least judging from your guidance? And then, how are the issues that you're facing now going to be resolved as you head into 2014? And what confidence should we have in your performance returning to the old Valspar standards?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Sure, Dmitry, it's Gary. Your first question. So I'll take your number of $0.20, and we'll work with that for a minute. $0.05 of it is tax, all right. As Jim mentioned, we're going to have a higher tax rate in the quarter than we expected and you probably modeled, so that's part of it. The rest of it is entirely sales-driven. When we adjusted our guidance after the first quarter, we expected that in Q3, Q4, we were going to see some recovery in international markets and in our GI business. I think Jim covered this in his prepared remarks. We didn't see that. We didn't see China strengthen to the extent that we expected. Our industrial business in China is still weak. And frankly, although our end had a good quarter this quarter, it's not up to the expectations that we had for Q3, and we don't think Q4 will be there either. Australia, we expected some recovery in the residential housing market in Australia. That has not happened. In fact, it's possible that, that market has gotten worse as the year has progressed. And both in my remarks and in Jim's remarks, we talked about the GI business and some of the segments that are weak there. So as you know from following the company for a while, that we've done a lot of work on our cost structure to develop operating leverage in the business. And so it doesn't take a lot or a huge sales miss in order to have an impact, disproportionate, possibly as you might look at it, disproportionate earnings miss. So that's it. It's all about that. It's all about sales in the fourth quarter that will not be where we expected them to be when we adjusted our guidance after Q1. With respect to your question about next year, I think both Jim and I made some comments about next year in our opening remarks and we're not here on this call to talk about guidance for next year. We'll do that in our fourth quarter. But I will say that I believe that we're set-up for a good year in 2014. So I'll just reiterate some of the things that I said in my introductory comments and Jim said as well. First is our U.S. business has been very strong this year. The housing market is recovering, construction spending is up and we have secured significant new business wins. Jim mentioned in the quarter that our volumes in the U.S. were up 10%, and for the year, they're up mid-single-digits. So we've got a lot of momentum in our U.S. business going into 2014. Second, our new business, the long-range plan -- the long-range businesses that we've talked about publicly particularly in our Paints segment, are on track. 2014 is the year that we go from investment to accretion in those businesses. We've invested significantly in those initiatives this year, prior to having the gross margin to support that full investment. Next year, that trend reverses itself and we start to see accretion from those investments. And as I mentioned, our net new business, we achieved our net new business targets in both our Coatings and our Paints segment in the quarter and have year-to-date and so that's momentum going into next year as well. We are starting with the restructuring that we announced in the second quarter and that will provide some tailwind to us going into next year. Inver, as Jim said, will provide about $0.10 of earnings accretion. And then, just like the opposite of the phenomenon that's we're experiencing this year with de-levering because our sales are not as strong as we expected, when these international markets and GI markets start to recover, we're going to get significant leverage out of that. So we're -- I think we're set up for a good year in 2014.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That's helpful, Gary. I just want to clarify, the shortfall in revenue versus expectations, I'm not sure what you were expecting, but looking at what I was expecting, which is basically high single-digit growth year-over-year in revenues for the fourth quarter, your guidance does not seem to be that significantly below it, so is the matter here that you're going to be selling more out of inventory rather than production so there is going to be a disproportionate margin impact on that slightly lower revenue, and just sort of rightsize towards the end of the year, is that what's going on?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, Dmitry, it's Jim. I'd answer that from the perspective of our expectations for the back half of the year as we exited Q2 had significant increases in sales based on the new business wins that we've been talking about all year long, plus the recovery in the markets that Gary mentioned. So from a sales expectation standpoint, we were expecting much higher sales. We also were expecting an appropriate margin rate that was going to go along with those sales. So as I look at where Q3 landed and what we expect for Q4, our margin expectations versus our internal plans really haven't changed that much between Q3 and Q4. Really, our miss versus our expectations is primarily sales-driven, as Gary mentioned. So we're not seeing any big surprises on the margin line. It's just that the businesses that we're selling through based on their current margin profile are lower than what some of our historical businesses have been. It's still very profitable, but we do not have a margin issue this year versus our plan. Our issue was top line-orientated.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. All right. So the top line -- okay, so maybe the way to put this is the top line shortfall that you're experiencing is in the higher margin product lines, so you're not getting the profit benefit of the perhaps faster growth at the lower margin lines?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Correct. It takes more profit volume from the lower margin lines to make up for those gaps. And once again, we know those markets are going to turn around eventually, because structurally, we've not lost business in those spaces. And we're expecting certainly a long-term profile of growth in many of those markets, especially GI, with good customers and good markets like China to recover.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Just one other point on that, Dmitry. I think, we've got a sales \u2013 I mean we've had a sales mix issue all year long. The Private Label business, we've talked about some of the wins in packaging coatings being at the lower selling prices. But if you look at our margin rate in coatings, you'll see that, that's still good business. As Jim said, it just takes more of it to make up for the gaps that we've seen in some of the higher-priced, higher-margin segments that are weak this year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "I was wondering if you could comment on kind of a longer-term outlook for Australia, because it looks like some of the data has been pointing to interest rates have been cut over there, home price has increased the most in years in the second quarter, existing home financing seems to be improving. So it doesn't sound like that's being reflected in your numbers. So kind of what's your outlook here over the next 18 months or so into 2014 for your Australia Paints business?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Well, you're right. I think the interest rate in Australia now is 2.5%, down from something like 7%. So the government is doing everything they can to stimulate the housing market. But the housing market is still bad. Kevin, we get Australian Paint Manufacturer Federation data, which is the actual volumes of paint that are sold by all the paint manufacturers in the Australian market, and that data last quarter said that trade volumes, that's professional painters' volumes, were down 8% to 9% on the previous year. So hopefully, we're at the bottom and some of the moves that the government is making to stimulate homeownership will take hold, but we can't count on that. We're going to run our business the way that we think is appropriate. And for us, that meant pretty dramatic, and over the last couple years, a pretty dramatic restructuring of the business to get the cost structure right. We lost some market share in that process. We've talked about that previously, that was the right thing to do for the long term. Where we sit today, it's a business that has the appropriate cost structure; that is winning in the retail marketplace, that means with the big box masters and independent trade stores, or independent paint stores and hardware stores, that's our retail market there, and that business is doing well; and the stores business that has the right cost structure and when it grows, we're going to get significant operating leverage out of that cost structure. Jim said and I said in my opening remarks that we saw some incremental improvement in our stores business in the quarter, that's encouraging. As that continues and as the market recovers, we're going to see a pretty significant earnings drive out of the actions that we've taken. But I can't call the market. I mean, I don't know. I would only be speculating. To answer your question directly, I would only be speculating as to what's going to happen in Australia.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And also, I was wondering if you could comment on kind of the sellout from your customers at the big box and distributor network here in the U.S. versus kind of your sell-in. Are you seeing any inventory management out of your customers in that channel at all or is it pretty standard right now?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, our customer, our big customer is managing their inventory extraordinarily well. They've got a great supply chain team and they're getting productivity on their inventory. The impact for us meant that year-over-year inventory is down about 10% in that channel. We are seeing strong sell-through. As I mentioned, mid-single-digit sales of Valspar products in that channel. And I think inventory today is appropriate for where it should be going into the remainder of the painting season. But there is a change year-over-year for us.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And then, finally, I just wondering if you could comment on how -- what raw materials did during the quarter and kind of outlook going forward?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, our outlook on that, Kevin, hasn't changed at all. Raw materials in the quarter were down modestly. We've looked at the different parts of the raw material portfolio, and as always, there's different moving pieces, but our view on that for the year really hasn't changed at all. We've pretty much been on our mark.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "The paint operating profits were roughly flat year-over-year. And so under normal circumstances, if your volumes grew mid-single-digits, I don't know, that would be $20 million to $25 million, your incremental margins should be 50%. So shouldn't your paint operating profit be up $10 million or $11 million year-over-year in the quarter? And so what's the hole? Where's the profit leaking out?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "There's no profit leaking out. As we've talked before, Jeff, about our plans for the Inver acquisition. We're selling Private Label paint at Ace. We make virtually no money on that today. We've got to restructure our operations, which was the subject of the second quarter restructuring announcement that we made to get our cost structure to the point where that's a profitable business. The Ace business really becomes profitable for us when we start selling Valspar paint. And so that's one issue. So frankly, 0 incremental profit on the Private Label. And then, we are making investment ahead of sales in Europe, the B&Q initiative, we've only got 30 stores set but we've got a full team of people ready to roll out our program into the other 320 stores. And we have investments that we've made prior to the rollout of the Valspar [indiscernible] with Ace.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Second question is when I look at your cost of goods sold year-over-year, it's up about 1%. And so, if your volume growth is up some mid-single-digit number, why isn't cost of goods sold up more?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, it's essentially the same mix of business as Gary's discussed, the Private Label mix of product, the cost of raw materials that go into that product line, plus the commodity trends that we have seen in the business have also impacted the mix of what's hitting the cost of goods sold line.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Going back to the margin issue and looking at Coatings, looks like operating margins were up nicely year-over-year during the quarter, it seems like a slightly different trend line than the last couple of quarters. Can you sort of take us through the drivers for that expansion, maybe some of the restructuring costs, are they starting to flow through, is it raw materials or business mix?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, it's 2 things. It's productivity programs that we're running continuously, Ghansham, and it is operating leverage on the increased volume.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then, on the Paint business, how much did the B&Q rollout to the 30 stores add to the volume profile for the quarter? And can you also give us some more color on Lowe's Pro and how the market reception is towards that product?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Sure. B&Q is immaterial, really. It's only 30 stores and we may have even shipped that in the second quarter, I'm not sure, but it was a very small amount of paint. And with respect to the professional program at Lowe's, I would say that we've been in the stores now since April. We have our full team in the field now. Just recently, we completed the buildout of our team. And I would say, from my perspective, we're hitting our targets. We have internal targets and we have agreed targets and we're hitting those targets.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Actually, this is Dan Jester sitting on for P.J. Can you -- is there any update into how many stores, Ace stores, the Valspar brand will be rolling out in, in the fourth quarter? Or is that still under discussion?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "As I mentioned in my opening remarks, Dan, we're ahead of our internal targets for that. But we're not going to talk about that probably for a couple of quarters.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then, for -- in general industrial, you talked about weak demand, talked about raw material pressure maybe not being that strong, is there any risk that we're going to see pricing falling in the next couple quarters, or is this mostly going to be volume-driven in terms of the slowdown in sales?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I think about that in terms of price cost. And we're in reasonable shape in terms of price cost today. And I would expect that in the future, we'll be in a reasonable place with price cost. So that's not a top-of-mind worry for me.", "Operator", "And we'll go to Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I would guess, given some of the caution you've suggested around near-term trends, people are going to be quite focused on how you perform the next couple quarters. So a couple questions around that, if I could. You mentioned, Gary, that B&Q slotting 30 stores didn't really give you much of a revenue or any earnings bump. Does slotting 300 do that for you? And I'm curious, what kind of turnover do you get in that kind of retail base? I mean, should we expect the first plug is going to help or is it less consequential to multiple turns during a paint season?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You always ask complicated questions, Bob.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That was hard just to ask it.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Here's the simple way that I think about it, which I've said with my team here. B&Q right now, so 30 stores is nothing. It's less than 10% of what we're going to ship. And honestly, we could have shipped that paint in Q2 to get ready for it. So that had no impact in the quarter. However, 100% of the expenses that -- almost 100% of the expenses that we'll incur at terminal volumes are in the business today. And we have 0 gross margin from paint sales to support that expense. And so the way I think about this model is as we start shipping paint, we're going to earn gross margin and that expense delta to -- eventually, the lines are going to cross and we're going to start making money. Now keep in mind that B&Q is not the most significant of the profit drivers that we're looking forward to in 2014. Essentially, B&Q is going to be slightly better than breakeven in 2014, if I remember right. We start making money in B&Q in '15. That's why in our opening remarks we called out '15 as the year when all these initiatives are fully realized. The other 2 key initiatives in our consumer paint business will be profitable in '14.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, the benefit we get from B&Q next year, Bob, is that we just don't -- when it compares to the results for this year, we don't have the drag of the upfront investment for the same magnitude. So Gary is right, expecting essentially a breakeven performance next year but that's coming off of a year where we purposely made investments to grow that business for the long term.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And can I ask, Gary, you mentioned in Ace Private Label, you make no money. I guess, I'm a little surprised at that, given you have some consolidation opportunity there, and I would guess you wouldn't be buying a business that couldn't make you some money. So what's going on there? And then, can you give us a sense of the Valspar national brand price point and what it would be versus the Ace Private Label price point?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, the second part of it, Bob, has to be agreed and all those things are still working. But I think if you look at the price points that we have in our independent channel, the distribution that we have in our independent channel, it would be similar to those price points. With respect to Private Label, the way we bid was private label is low margin and we -- in order to achieve that low margin, we've got to complete the restructuring actions that we announced in Q2. So as those things happen, and they started and are on track, but as those cost reductions are realized, then we start making money on the Private Label business. Tyler will help you privately model that a little bit better.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "It's just that the upfront volume that we're selling, based on our agreed price with Ace and the current infrastructure that's in place, basically doesn't allow us profit margin. As we make those restructuring efforts that Gary talked about, we get to a profit margin in the Private Label business that's commensurate with what we expect the Private Label product to have in the marketplace.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "The return -- if you just isolated the Private Label business from the branded business, the Private Label business would be good business for us. It is not -- we didn't sell our souls to the devil on the Private Label business to win a contract on the branded business.", "Operator", "And we'll go to John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just a quick question on the incremental cost that you're taking. And when I look at your SG&A line, it's actually down year-over-year a reasonable amount, especially considering all these investments. So I guess, can you walk us through where those investments are actually hitting? And maybe the magnitude of them?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, John, it's Jim. There's a couple components, if you recall, in the SG&A, that are masking some of the cost increases and I tried to refer to this in my comments. Two specific things that I would point out is that given our updated view of expected performance for the year, you would expect that we have been truing up our bonus and incentive expectations commensurate to that performance. So we're seeing lower bonus expense versus last year flow through the SG&A line, which is masking part of it. The other thing we've talked about in previous calls is that we've got some geographic changes between expense and gross margin related to programs that we had in place historically to support advertising spend with our big box customers. So while that had no impact to the bottom line, it results in basically a little lower SG&A expense this year than last year. So if I look at that, it's basically a re-class item plus the lower incentive comp, that's masking any increases that Gary talked about in the go-forward investments that we're making behind Ace, Lowe's Pro and B&Q.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, just one last question. On the incremental investments like for some of these growth platforms, how much of them are kind of onetime-ish or last a year or so in nature and how much of them are just permanent, and then you really just need the volumes coming through?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, I think, there's combination of both. I would put more of them in the -- I'd say about 60% of it in the camp that's going to be ongoing for sure that we just need the volume and margin dollars to come along with. Certainly, the beginning expenses for some of the manufacturing efforts we're doing and things of that nature will be one-off in nature.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "A question on -- back on Ace, if your contract is such that your price and volume are set so you're not making any margin, what's going to allow you to make that margin in the go forward, is it capacity rationalization? Maybe the -- will that contract change? Just hoping for some color on what will allow you to generate margin in the Private Label business with Ace?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, so appreciate the question and the follow-up if there's confusion there. So I'd probably start with an umbrella view that we're going to make money in the Private Label business and the branded business for Ace, and we're very confident about that model. The way it works from a phasing perspective is essentially we're starting by selling in the Private Label business and then obviously we're going to be selling in the Valspar business. From a cost prospective, what we announced at the time of the Ace transaction was the fact that we were going to be restructuring some of their supply chain and manufacturing operations. We are in the process of doing that already. When we get that work done this year, we'll have a cost structure that allows us to make a nice margin on the Private Label business. So our comments this morning have really been focused on the temporal investments that we've had to make this year as part of the transition in acquiring those assets and the rationalization process that we're going through.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Got it. Now last quarter, it sounded like the expectation was the heavy machinery market had reached about and certainly wasn't going to go any lower, updated expectations seem that maybe that was a bit sanguine. Curious as to how you think about the cyclical versus secular trends in heavy machinery certainly and particularly in North America, given what many people seem to believe would be sort of a peak in the farm profitability, and hence, the CapEx cycle, at least for farm equipment going into 2014?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Good question, Nils. There's 2. So heavy equipment. There's agricultural equipment, and then there's off-road, so that's mining, construction, et cetera. The weakness that we're experiencing in our business is in the latter, not so much in the former. And our business is heavily skewed towards the latter, not the former. So if you thought about cyclical versus secular, we think it's a cyclical -- this is a cyclical trend that we're in. We've been here before and we've always come out of it. The one place where you might -- some people might disagree with that would be in the mining equipment space. If you believe that growth in China is permanently at -- reset at a lower rate and Johnny doesn't need iron ore and other materials to keep building, then you could argue that it's secular. But where we are and where our customers are and our customers -- our big customers have been very transparent about this, is that this is a cyclical trend, not a structural one.", "Operator", "And next, we'll go to Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Gary, I think you mentioned earlier in the call that you can't call the macro or the market that seems like that was the real delta in the guidance. My sense, and perhaps it was the wrong one, last quarter, was that you guys were very confident that you would see the sequential improvement in the business overall in the fourth quarter. If that's -- so I guess my question, as you look forward to 2014, in thinking about how you communicate with us and your investors, do you need to be giving annual guidance, in your view? And what are the puts and takes as you think about that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We're going to give annual guidance. And Charlie, the -- we're still going to grow in our fourth quarter. We're going to have nice growth in our fourth quarter. This is going to be a record year for Valspar, on the top line and earnings. It's just not going to be the record that we expected it to be. And if you think about the size of our company and what our revenue miss will be in the fourth quarter, while it's disappointing, I think I've explained that with the leverage that we have in our operations today, it doesn't take much of a revenue miss to come up with a significant earnings miss. And that fundamentally is the issue. So we had -- what we didn't expect in the third quarter, back to your question about our optimism, we didn't expect the inventory destocking that we've seen. We -- our customers believe that the -- particularly in off-road, believe that sell-through was occurring. In fact, what was happening is that dealers were destocking inventory and manufacturers were destocking inventory. And this is, I think, a global phenomenon in that market. And that is the fundamental thing that we didn't anticipate. We also did, and I'll say this, we did believe the rhetoric that China was going to get better. We did believe that with the new leadership in China, there would be stimulus that was pumped into the economy that would make the Chinese economy stronger than it has been. Not -- so those are the -- and if you parse the mess, those are the 2 fundamental drivers of the mess. But in terms of annual guidance, we're going to give it and we're going to get close to it.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And just a follow-up. The quarter itself, I think, to your earlier point, the Coatings business margins were actually very good, given the sort of end market weakness that you guys have seen. But I think that the paint margins were below what most people expected. And I understand that a lot of that's due to the investments that you're making in your new business. As we think -- and that those will be accretive in 2014. But as we think about the pace of those investments and the scale up, how should we think about how quickly those improve, I guess, going forward?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, there's a couple of -- Charlie, it's Jim. There's a couple of things that we'll learn from that, and we'll get more visibility as we go through the fourth quarter, along the lines of how the Valspar paint program at Ace works for instance. But if you helicopter up and look at the margins, to your point, in the paint business. Year-over-year, we're expecting margins in the paint business to be essentially flat. That's after growing 100-odd basis points last year. So given the influx that we've had this year of the Private Label volume with Ace and the startup expenses, to be sitting here at year-end, our expectation is to be flat year-over-year in EBIT margins, we feel good about that. We had expected more because of more top line growth. As we get into next year and we see more profitable volume coming through the Ace business based on the branded sales as we get leverage on the investments that we've made for B&Q and Lowe's Pro and things of that nature, we're looking for next year to be a year of expanded operating margins in the paint business. So I'd say our 2-year view of the business margins are still the same. It's just going to be a little choppier to get there where we've seen the back half of this year fall off from a volume perspective.", "Operator", "And we'll go to the line of Dave Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Gary, strong performance in packaging, driven by these non-BPA -- BPA-free coatings. How much longer can this outsized performance continue do you think?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, at least through the first half of next year, as most of the new business wins that we've won, David, have come in the second half this year. So but our long-term view on our packaging coatings business is very bullish. We have an opportunity, as we -- particularly as this non-BPA market continues to grow, we have an opportunity to become more significant in a couple of key markets where we don't believe that we have our fair share, and those are Europe and in Asia. So this business has traditionally grown at 2x the market rate. I think, if you went back over 10 years and looked at our packaging coatings business, that's been our history, we're the global leader, we have more infrastructure, both in terms of technology resources, tech service resources and regulatory resources than any of our competitors, and we expect to keep winning in this business.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Very good. And just on U.S. paints, what's your forecast for the growth of the U.S. paint volumes this season year-over-year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We don't have -- I don't know. We tend to think about it in terms of comps. So strength -- so I don't know the volume number. But we thought that we would have comps in the sort of low single-digits, 2%, 3%, 4%, we're experiencing better than that at the moment.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And just lastly, Gary, on Inver, $0.10 of accretion from -- in 2014, aided by the restructuring. How much more in '15? Is it $0.15, $0.20 in that range or\u2026", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, we'll lay that out at a later date. But you would imagine it would go up. I don't imagine, I know it will go up, based on the full year realization of synergies that we'll have going in 2015 and before, not only from the Inver business and those back-end savings that we expect to generate but also getting the full year benefit from the European restructuring actions. So in this market, given how the market performed and we performed this year, we've been taking actions to improve the cost structure for the long term. You saw us in Q2 announce important restructuring actions based on what we were able to do with the Ace business and restructure our North American business, we're doing the same thing now in Europe. We're encouraged that Europe feels like it's starting to stabilize from our standpoint. Certainly, Giovanni and the Inver team have done a fabulous job of growing that business during the last 4 or 5 years, so we're very encouraged around what the scale and leadership of that team can bring to our European operations in total. So we expect Inver is going to provide us benefits above and beyond just the Inver business, but just our European business in total over the next several years. And we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "And that'll be from the line of Steve Schwartz with First Analysis.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Just one question. And this is if you could add some color to the off-road and container situation, shipping container. It sounds like that adjusted for seasonality, those 2 product lines are essentially running flat sequentially. So the declines are no longer increasing, is that true?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, that's probably true for off-road container, it's at the bottom. Containers are at the bottom. I think, Steve, I think, last year, we were supplying 7 plants at this time; today, we're supplying 1, and the reason is the other 6 are not operating. So there are very, very few shipping containers being manufactured in China today. That obviously is not going -- a situation that will not persist for too much longer, I wouldn't think, since global trade continues, ships -- shipping containers wear out, they get washed overboard, the industry will need more shipping containers. When that happens and how much inventory there is, I don't know. But we're not going to stay where we are indefinitely.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Okay. So you say container, you think is at a bottom. You don't think off-road is at a bottom yet?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We don't know.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Okay. Can you give us an idea of when you guys started to see the significantly negative comps? When do you think you're going to anniversary each of these product lines with the weakness? I mean, it's going to be somewhere in '14, right? Is it the second quarter, third quarter?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, it's Jim. I would tell you, helicoptering up from a container business perspective in the overall impact for the company, it's not just that material until we get the future growth that Gary talked about. If you're looking in the off-road segment, we've actually seen declining comps all year long. But they've gotten -- they've improved as the year's progressed. So we'll anniversary a good chunk of the declines through the first half of next year.", "Tyler N. Treat", "Operator, that's the last question?", "Operator", "It is. Please go ahead.", "Tyler N. Treat", "Thanks, John. Thanks to our audience for participating in our third quarter earnings conference call. Follow-up questions from investors and analysts can be directed to me, Tyler Treat. Questions from the media can be directed to Mark Goldman. Contact information for both of us is on our press release.

In order to allow more time for questions, we provided balance sheet items and other selected information on our website at sherwin.com, under Investor Relations third quarter press release.", "Summarizing overall company performance for the third quarter 2013 versus third quarter 2012, consolidated net sales increased 9.4% to $2.85 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes in our Paint Stores Group.", "Acquisition increased consolidated net sales 1.1% in the quarter, and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales 0.8%. Gross profit dollars increased $145.7 million to $1.3 billion. Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 45.5% of sales from 44.2% in the third quarter last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes that were partially offset by import duty assessments related to our Brazilian operations. These import duty assessments reduced gross margin by 60 basis points in the quarter.", "Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased 11.2% to $889.7 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 31.2% in the third quarter this year from 30.7% last year. Incremental SG&A from new stores, customer service investments and acquisitions accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the quarter.", "Interest expense increased approximately $5 million to $15.4 million, due primarily to prefunding of the Comex acquisition. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $44.5 million, or 13%, to $387.5 million. Profit before tax as a percent of sales increased to 13.6% from 13.2% last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter this year was 32.1%, compared to 31.5% in the third quarter of 2012.", "Year-to-date, our effective tax rate is 32.1%, which is in line with our expectation for full year 2013. Consolidated net income increased $28 million to $263 million compared to $235 million in the third quarter of 2012. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.2% from 9% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $2.55 per share from $2.24 per share in the same period last year.", "Third quarter 2013 reported EPS includes the Brazilian import duty assessment, which decreased diluted net income per common share $0.13 in the quarter. Currency translation increased earnings per share in the quarter by $0.02 and acquisitions reduced earnings per share $0.02.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter increased 13.5% to $1.76 billion. Higher paint sales volumes across all end market segments accounted for most of the increase in sales. Acquisitions increased sales by 1.5% in the quarter.", "Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 10.9% in the quarter compared to the third quarter last year. Regionally in the third quarter, our Southeastern division led the sales performance, followed by Southwestern division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. 3 of the 4 Paint Stores divisions reported double-digit sales increases compared to last year.", "Segment profit for the group increased $58.8 million, or 19.6%, to $359.4 million in the quarter, as higher sales volumes were partially offset by higher year-over-year selling, general and administrative expenses and dilution from the Comex acquisition. Acquisitions decreased segment profit by $2.6 million. Operating margin increased to 20.4% from 19.3% in the third quarter last year.", "Turning to our Consumer Group. Sales in the third quarter increased 5.4% to $366.8 million, due primarily to the timing of seasonal shipments to some customers. Acquisitions increased Consumer Group net sales 0.2% in the quarter. Third quarter segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $16 million or 28% to $73.1 million, due primarily to higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies.", "Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 19.9% from 16.4% in the same period last year. For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars increased 3.1% to $507.3 million in the quarter, due primarily to selling price increases and acquisitions.", "In the quarter, acquisitions increased net sales in U.S. dollars by approximately 1.3%, and unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased sales by 0.4%. Stated in U.S. dollars, third quarter segment profit increased $8.1 million, or 22.2%, to $44.5 million, due primarily to higher selling prices, improved operating efficiency and positive currency translation. Currency rate changes increased segment profit in the quarter by $3.4 million.", "As a percent to external net sales, segment profit increased to 8.8% from 7.4% in the third quarter last year. For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales in U.S. dollars were flat to last year at $208.6 million. Selling price increases and higher sales volumes in the quarter were offset by unfavorable currency rate changes. Unfavorable currency decreased net sales by 8.9% in the quarter.", "Stated in U.S. dollars, segment profit decreased to a loss of $1 million in the quarter, compared to profit of $21.9 million last year, primarily due to charges related to an import duty tax assessment in Brazil. Charges of $19.8 million were recorded in the quarter to resolve a dispute by the Brazilian government over our handling of import duties through the year 2012.", "We believe the second and third quarter payments to the Brazilian government totaling $31.6 million fully resolve all claims related to import duties.", "Currency translation rate changes had no significant impact on third quarter segment profit. And as a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a negative 0.5% from 10.5% in the third quarter 2012.", "I'll conclude my remarks from the quarter with a brief update on the status of our lead pigment litigation. Arguments in the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties against 5 defendant companies concluded on September 23. As a reminder, this is a bench trial. The outcome will be determined by the judge presiding over the case.", "By statute, the judge has 90 days from the date of closing arguments to deliberate and render a judgment. At this point, we have no further indication or sense of timing on the decision.", "That concludes our review of the results for third quarter 2013. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the remainder of the year. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The third quarter was another solid quarter for Sherwin-Williams in terms of sales momentum, profit improvement and cash generation.", "Consolidated sales, net income and earnings per share each set new record highs for any quarter in our company's history. Net operating cash increased more than $100 million compared to the third quarter of 2012. It stands at just over 10% of sales through our first 9 months.", "Excluding the import duty assessments in Brazil, our flow-through on pretax income was more than 37% through 9 months. Paint Stores Group continued to deliver strong year-over-year sales growth at the pace we believe is comfortably ahead of the market. Comp store revenue and gallon volume both posted strong double-digit gains in the quarter. And for the second consecutive quarter, segment profits, as a percent of sales, exceeded 20%.", "Our investments in new store openings and superior store staffing continues to drive profitable market share growth for this team. Consumer Group reported solid sales growth in the quarter as well. It is somewhat by the timing of seasonal shipments to some customers. The strong profit performance in Consumer Group was the result of gross margin expansion from significantly higher manufacturing volumes, primarily to support Paints Service Group, as well as good SG&A expense control.", "Our Global Finishes Group also turned in a strong profit performance in the quarter, despite weak demand in many regions where they compete in the world. Backing up the effects of acquisitions and currency, sales grew just over 2%, while segment profit increased nearly 13%.", "Through 9 months, Global Finishes segment profit margin has increased 110 basis points, solid progress towards the double-digit operating margin target we've commented on in the past. Latin American Coatings Group continues to face significant headwinds from currency devaluation and softening market condition. Sales in local currencies and volumes were positive in the quarter, but segment profit continued to be pressured by weak currency and a tepid demand environment.", "On the raw material front. Over the past few quarters, we've seen a steady stream of price increase announcements across a broad range of commodity categories. Many of the major chloride TiO2 producers announced first and second quarter price increases in the range of $0.10 per pound, followed by a third round of price increase announcements in September, with nominal effective dates around October 1.", "Crude oil and propylene are also trading above their average pricing levels in the first half. Given the timing and impact of these announcements, we think that most of these increases are unlikely to gain traction over the balance of 2013. 2014 remains uncertain, and we will give more guidance on this topic during our year-end call in late January.", "Our full year outlook for average raw material cost for the industry should be down low single-digits compared to 2012, still feels about right to us. Although input costs have shifted from a strong headwind to a slight tailwind over the past 24 months, the majority of a 130-basis-point increase in our third quarter gross margin resulted from volume-driven operating efficiencies in our global supply chain.", "The SG&A spending was up almost $90 million in the quarter and increased 50 basis points as a percent of sales. Most of this increase was attributable to a higher service expense across our existing store base to 84 net new stores we've opened in the past 12 months, and incremental SG&A from acquisitions. We've commented in the past about the benefits of investing ahead of market growth. I clearly believe the SG&A investments we made in our Paint Stores Group in the back half of 2012 contributed significantly to the strong revenue and volume growth they've reported these past 9 months.", "In the third quarter, we generated $476 million in net operating cash, bringing our 9-month net operating cash to $778 million. Our 9-month free cash flow, net operating cash, less CapEx and dividends, was $550 million. We continue to invest the company's cash to expand the controlled distribution platform, complete suitable acquisitions, increase our dividends, and purchase shares of stock from the treasury.", "In the first 9 months, our Paint Stores Group added 42 net new stores, 20 of which were opened in the third quarter. In September, we completed the acquisition of the Comex business in the U.S. and Canada, which added 306 stores. We finished the quarter with 3,868 stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, compared to 3,478 stores a year ago.", "Today, we're increasing our guidance for Paint Stores Group to accelerate net new store openings up to 80 to 90 during this year. In the third quarter, we bought back 1.5 million shares of our common stock in the open market, bringing our year-to-date total to 2.8 million shares at an average price of $175.72.", "In September 30, we have remaining authorization require 13.65 million shares. Last week, our Board of Directors approved the quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, up from $0.39 last year. On the eve of our second quarter earnings call, we received word that the Federal Competition Commission in Mexico had voted to block our acquisition of the Comex business in Mexico. Since that time, we worked closely with the regulatory authorities to secure approval and complete the transaction.", "Last Tuesday, the newly seated competition commission held a hearing to consider our case. We expect the ruling within 5 business days of the hearing, and both parties stand ready to complete this transaction promptly if and when we receive regulatory clearance.", "In the fourth quarter, the Comex stores in the U.S. and Canada should generate sales in the range of $95 million to $105 million, and earnings dilution of $0.20 to $0.40 per share. The wide range in earnings impact is due to uncertainty of the timing of various integration activities. A significant amount of the anticipated integration work in the U.S. and Canada will fall under calendar year 2014 as well, resulting in earnings dilution next year for this business. These stores should be accretive to earnings by 2015, and we will keep you posted on our progress throughout next year.", "Without the Comex U.S. and Canada business, we expect fourth quarter 2013 consolidated net sales to increase 5% to 7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. With sales of that level, we expect core diluted net income per common share for the quarter to be in the range of $1.29 to $1.39 per share, compared to $0.65 per share in 2012, which included a $0.47 per share charge for our deal of settlement.", "For the full year 2013, we expect consolidated net sales to increase by mid-single digit percentage over last year. With annual sales of that level, we're updating guidance for diluted net income per common share for the year to be in the range of $7 to $7.30 per share, including the Brazil import duty assessment and dilution from the domestic Comex business, compared to $6.02 per share earned in 2012.", "Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. Obviously, there's been some concern over the impacts of higher interest rates on some of the housing fundamentals here in the U.S. You obviously reported a very strong quarter regardless. So was there any sort of cautionary indicators that you saw during 3Q, either by geographic region or specific channel?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Ghansham, I'd say no. The pure suite we have on market demand is always through our Paint Stores Group. In recent quarters, the new residential segment has been our strongest performer, followed by residential repaint. So those are the 2 categories that would be impacted by any of that. And frankly, we're just not seeing any of that impacting our business.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on Comex, you provided some parameters on 4Q. And Chris, you mentioned some commentary on 2014 in dilution as well. But how should we think about it on '14 on a quarterly basis?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "On a quarterly basis -- this is Sean Hennessy. And let me just try to give you a little more color on this, and maybe this will help you. We think instead of trying to look at the quarter through the first 12 months, let's take a look at the first 15 months. That would take us to the end of 2014. We think during that time frame, we'll lose $0.60 to $0.65 of this Comex U.S. and Canada piece. That would include all the synergy and the integration cost as well as -- right now, this asset is losing operating profit at this current time. But I think that $0.60 to $0.65 is all win. So when we get to calendar 2015, we'll have positive operating profits from this acquisition. So when you look at quarters, I think we'll try to give you a little more color by first, second, third, fourth quarter. But I think, especially when we try to give you that guidance of $0.20 to $0.40, if you ask the follow-up questions that mean if we did all $0.40, then next year would be $0.20 to $0.25, I'd say yes. If it becomes around $0.20 because of the integration costs not being able to be booked in the fourth quarter, then I think next year would be $0.40 to $0.45 by quarter, that's not exactly clear yet and as they're termed by a few things. But by 2015, we see this is a positive operating profit.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Nocella with RBC Capital Markets.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "The increments of flow-through to earnings in the stores business was a little bit lower this quarter than the past years. Your SG&A ticked a little bit higher. So is this incremental margin progression kind of more in line with the normalized range? Or is there some upside maybe as you acclimate some new stores into your network?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think after the second quarter's results, Chris, and stores posted over 50% incremental margin, we caution you not to get too comfortable with that number as much as we would like to see that. So I think what you're seeing in the quarter and the year-to-date numbers are more typical. We commented around that up to 30% incremental margin and more comfortable signing up to that through the remainder of the year.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Got you. And on the Comex Mexico deal, it seems like you're still pretty confident that it gets done here. Do you think that it goes forward as originally planned or maybe will there be some concessions as you get that through?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. The last commission, we had gotten to a point with them where we had proposed remedies to address some of their concerns. I think it would be premature to comment on how this next commission will look at that. We're certainly aware of those remedies and maybe will be available to them, if necessary. And at this time, we're just not sure how it's going to go. We have commented that we remain optimistic and prepare to move forward. And hopefully next week, we're going to have some good news.", "Christopher J. Nocella - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And just one last for me for my account. Just what spurred your decision to accelerate the store growth year-on-year?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well I think we're seeing terrific results out of the group. Our confidence in the market is going forward. Over the next several years, we're going to be that we're going to continue to see high demand for these products as housing rebounds and we yet begin to see with any sustained volume, the rebound in the commercial markets, which will also impact that segment of the company as well. So I think you should read into that the confidence we have going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was hoping you could just comment, same-store sales last quarter were up about 7%, this quarter about 10%, 9%, so a pretty big acceleration. Is that real in that sequentially, it was improving that much? Or might it be that just last year was a lower base in Q3? What was the differential there in your mind?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think you hit it. I think last year's second quarter was very, very strong in 2012. And the third quarter was the opposite. We probably had our weakest comp stores in 2012. So we felt pretty good about going up against that history in the third quarter. But I think when you look at the sales per store and so forth, we feel the market was pretty much the same in the third, as well as the second, really more has to do with the history.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then just 2 quick questions on the Comex and the commission down there. First one is, are any of the people the same on this commission versus the first? And then the second is, is this an official process where they kind of have to give a declaration of the said time? Or is this something that they could reach out to you and kind of negotiate quietly, where they don't have to put out, say, a press release on this until it's finished?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Duffy, there are no commissioners seated on this body that were on the previous commission. So the answer to your first question is no. And then, secondarily, my understanding is, by Mexican law, they have 5 business days to respond to the case that was put in front of them. I don't think there's going to be negotiations at this point. I think we're just going to get an up or down vote.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Can you talk about the commercial or nonresidential market? I know it goes up with the lag, but what kind of growth are you seeing or you could see in 2014?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, P.J. What we're seeing is kind of a staggered start of the commercial market. You're correct that it typically moves with the 12- to 18-month lag to residential. We are seeing that pickup in certain nonresidential categories, like office space and hospitality have been relatively strong. That strength has been offset by weakness in retail in some of the manufacturing segments, and anything that relies on public funding is pretty soft. So schools, libraries, government buildings, et cetera, has been very weak year-over-year, actually, down pretty significantly year-over-year. So it's a mixed bag. But in total, it's just barely better than flat thus far. We do expect to pick up in many of those other categories, and we'll see growth in the market when that happens.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And your same-store sales in Paint group were up 10.9%. Even that there was very little pricing this year, is it all volumes? And could you -- also can you make a quick comment on what you're seeing in DIY with this contractor?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. So I think, P.J., we've been commenting all year that all of the growth is, in fact, Vi [ph] is running a little bit higher than sales because we have some mixed shift in the business. We've commented that the new residential business is leading the pack, and that's by design is the lower average selling price per gallon. So a little deflationary pricing in the mix. So with the 10.9% revenue from the comp stores, the volume was actually stronger than that. So again, we can expect that to continue going forward. DIY has been a good story for us as well. It lags a little bit. The residential new construction and residential repaint segments, but it's been a strong contributing performer for the company now for several years.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was hoping you could give us a little bit more color about the Consumer Group. I saw the comments about the timing of certain sales. How much of an impact does that have on the group? And is there any way to adjust for that and figure out what sort of the trend is?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So I think that we've been commenting that as a result of the loss of these 2 types of business that we're anniversarying, both the Walmart domestically and Home Depot in Mexico, that this business was going to be off slightly low-single digits down in revenue for the year. We've been chalking [ph] at that through the first 2 quarters. We did see a spike in kind of shipments as we commented. Most of that happened in the last month of the quarter. And so that was kind of the timing comment. We would expect that the fourth quarter will be back to kind of that soft performance. So nothing really different there in terms of the company job [ph] position or program, and just riding along with the friends of [ph] customers we enjoy in that business.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And just a couple of housekeeping items. Were there any significant diesel [ph] or closing cost regarding the Comex North America businesses and the SG&A line or elsewhere? And could you give the gross profit year-over-year change by segment?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. When you look at the Comex, we commented that it was $0.02 in the quarter. And that $0.02 is really imposed. It's all-in at $0.02. We're probably not going to break out gross margin and SG&A at Comex for 1 month. On the incremental dollars, the gross profit dollars that we will have in the Q. Store Group was up $129 million. Consumer was up $17 million. Global was up -- segment was up $13 million. LACG was down $12 million, and as from that Bob's script and Chris also mentioned that was depressed by approximately by $20 million due to the Brazilian situation. So without the Brazilian tax situation, LACG would have been up high-single digits.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Robert Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could guys talk a little bit about why Comex's business isn't making an operating profit. It seems most of the times, when you buy regionalized businesses, they've done well. So is it just their spread too far? Their density is not high enough? What is it about the business that's not as currently profitable that other acquisitions have been?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I would say their spread in density, Bob, is terrific, actually. They've got really good brand recognition, store locations and penetration in the geographies that they're operating in. This is a business that, at the time of Comex's acquisition, was really focused on new residential construction, almost fully. And last, the product line and/or the discipline to really expand into all the other professional painting contractor segments and DIY that have been kind of the hallmark of the Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores. Over the years, their timing was a little bit unfortunate in that they rode the housing market down and really didn't do a lot to try to mitigate that, with standing to different segments. So as we did these businesses and quickly get them ramped up, with a broader product selection, better inventory control, better associated product sales, which Sherwin-Williams always has brought to all of these acquisitions, and a little bit of a better DIY present. So we would expect to start to see them rebound, closer to Sherwin-Williams' typical store margins. And I think Sean really articulated that well how we kind of get from where we are today to these integrations and to a positive return in 2015. And then from that platform begin to move them up to our traditional stores' operating margins. So thrilled to have these stores. The talent that came with them in terms of store management, sales reps, the folks that face customers are great. And we're excited to get them up and running.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Chris, will they be rebranded as Sherwin stores? Or will they remain Comex?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. Well first of all, they're not called Comex in United States. They operate under 5 different brand names that were the original names of these businesses. We may have been rolled up back in late 1990s. And Comex did nothing to really change that or integrate that. Our practice has been, Bob, over time, to carefully secure all the customer relationships and, at the appropriate time, rebrand these stores under Sherwin-Williams. That process can take anywhere from 3 to 5 years or longer, depending on the individual market and strength of the brand. And that same kind of thoughtful process that we use for Duron and MAB and some of the other recent acquisitions will be the case here as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Kevin McCarthy of Bank of America.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Chris, I was wondering if you could speak to the expected growth in U.S. architectural gallon at the industry level for 2013.", "Robert J. Wells", "Kevin, this is Bob. As you know, an industry that is not well tracked and measured, there's a lot of estimates out there. The estimates by the American Coatings Association is that the industry, through the first half, went up mid-single digits, stronger in the second quarter than in the first, to actually upper single-digit in the second quarter. We have not seen any indication that market growth in the third quarter thus far. And the ACA typically lags the end of the quarter by a month or so. So -- and frankly, we're not very well versed on their methodology, so I don't know how they're gathering this data. But it feels to us like mid single-digits is probably not out of the realm of possibilities for the market.", "Christopher M. Connor", "And that was on top of 3.7% increase in 2012, which was pretty well-corroborated by the ability to look back, which you can tie a bunch of different sources. So to Bob's point, an accelerating market was a better industry gallon numbers this year than last year. Hence, more support for the earlier questions about why we're deciding to open more stores.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's helpful. I guess, speaking of acceleration. I want to come back to your store count. I guess you're 42 year-to-date, so 80 to 90 would imply something like 38 to 48 in 4Q, if my math is right there. So a couple of questions. Have you done that many in a quarter before? And as you look at integrating the U.S. portion of Comex, should we think of that number as a grosser net number, given any rationalization that you may need to do as integration progresses?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So this staying on the 80 to 90 estimates for the core incremental growth, we absolutely, Kevin, despite our best efforts, haven't gotten to open that many stores in the quarter. This process always ends up being a back half-loaded exercise, despite how hard we push on various real estate developers to get these stores into us sooner. In fact, last year, in the fourth quarter, we opened 42 stores. So we'll have to get that done and to know how to do that and we expect to go forward on that. We haven't commented yet on the 306 Comex stores relative to what the likely closings would be there as a result of overlapping locations. I think, if you would look historically at past transactions we've made, somewhere in the 15% to 20% store count would be kind of at the high end of the closings that we would affect. That would put you, in this particular scenario, in a 40 to 60 store count. Don't forget, Kevin, that as we've shown various maps, these stores are actually falling into geographies where our penetration is slightly less than it had been in more of our denser markets. And so our expectation is that we probably won't see numbers that high, maybe 10% to 15% range will be a better -- we'll have to think about. And those announcements will come up out as leases expire and then we get a better chance to get our hands in the business. Again, as we commented, we'll give you a lot more color as we go through 2014 on this business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matt McGinley with ISI Group.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "A year ago, when you introduced us to Comex, you had said that the business, when you purchased it, it was like maybe worth somewhere around $1 in earnings in the first year. And you indicated that there will be charges related to U.S. operations will be $0.60 to $0.65. Does that imply that the Mexico assets are worth about $1.60 in year 1? Or is this more of a fixer-upper than you had anticipated in that dollar earnings that you had talked about a year ago as off the table?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Just to clarify one thing, what you said is if we could close that Comex field by the end of the first quarter, so once you given us 9 months to do a lot of integration work that we're just talking about now with the U.S. and Canada piece, we would start to look at the dollar in -- a year later. Number one, that's down a little deeper. We're able to close this on September 16. But your sense of -- it's not apples and oranges, it's a little -- it's closer than apples but it's not totally apples-to-apples. But Kevin said what you just said, you're absolutely right. All of the indication would be -- is that the Mexican asset would be able to -- is a very strong asset, producing nice operating margin.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And the U.S. assets were maybe not as good as you had anticipated when you first looked at the total operation, or the Mexican asset was as good as they were 1 year ago?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No. Yes. Both of those things. I think, we're not that surprised of where we ended up in the U.S. and Canada assets. They're pretty much where we thought they would be. And the Mexican piece is doing fine. When -- we get asked every once in a while, \"Would you continue to whet your appetite?\" Our appetite is still there for that Mexican piece because that Mexican piece will create shareholder value.", "Matthew McGinley - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Last quarter, you discussed some distortions related to weather that may be interior versus exterior mix shift. And in fact negative and positive [ph] did that reverse in the third quarter? And how much do you think that perhaps pent up demand helped the unit growth in the third quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think, we actually were mentioning that in the first quarter, because in the first quarter 2012, there was repainting going on in Chicago in February. And so there was really no winter as compared to a normal winter. So that first quarter was when we really mentioned it. And I would tell you that pent up, year-to-date, I think, it's evened itself out. But when you talk about that, I don't think it changed any of the pent up. In the third quarter, I think it had more to do with last year in the third quarter was our lowest comp store increase. But I don't see that as a factor.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse group.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just 2 quick ones. On the Consumer segment, the margins were noticeably higher, actually, than they've ever been for a third quarter. How much of it is tied to the strength in Paint Stores versus the lumpiness that you were talking about in terms of order patterns? And is this kind of a sustainable level now that the Paint Store Group is kind of as big as it is?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I would say that's 60-40. I think the lumpiness of the sales was 60% of that improvement. Store group was 40%. I think that if you look at the beginning of the quarter, we were managing our SG&A and so forth. Nothing [ph] is as strong as sales. But that strong improvement in sales, the consumer for the timing really helped the margins in the third quarter, but the Paint Stores group having that volume go through and it was nice. I would tell you, over the years, we've continually talked about this consumer group being more in the flattish long-term and we've said that the margins, and you've correctly pointed out, one of the strongest margins we've ever had, will be a little more choppy than stores. But there'll be times when these quarters, we will have quarters like this because of the volume going through and certain things hitting. The operating margins will be higher than stores. But over the long term, we think that it will be slightly higher because of where stores group in. But it won't be this high. In fact, every fourth quarter, that operating margin is depressed a little bit in that Consumer Group.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, just so we understand what may come out in next week in terms of the decision from the commission, is that a -- that's the end of the game kind of decision and it's either a yes or a no? Or is there a further appeal process, or is your appeal already in and you can get some derivation of an answer, whether it's yes/no, or yes, if you do the following? How should we think about what the decision actually could potentially be?", "Robert J. Wells", "That's a fair question, John, and I wish I had more certainty on how I answer this. This is a brand-new commission, and we are one of the first rulings that they're going to distribute. There's a possibility that their decision is in line with our proposal to them and we accept it and we're good to go. There may be things that don't agree with what we had prepared to do and they're asking for more. At which point, we would have the ability to discuss that further with them. So it's a little bit of a difficult answer for us to give until we actually get into the arena.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "If we look at that -- Sean, if we look at that $0.60 to $0.65 you suggested for the next 4 quarters for Comex U.S., Canada, I'd like to think about it in 3 pieces. One would be noncash-type charges related to, say, write-offs or impairment. And then, what's the underlying operating losses for the business? And then, thirdly, what the percentage of that amount would be, cash integration expenses?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Chuck, over the next 12 months of doing the purchase accounting, we're having evaluations. And so we probably have a better answer for you maybe in 2 quarters. And the reason I say that is it really depends on how much value we put on certain assets that we eventually are going to eliminate. And so that would be, back to your point, the noncash charges. But we'll see what happens. I think, when you take a look at the cash and [indiscernible] our cash, and I would tell you when you think about $0.60 to $0.65, and I'll use $0.60 and 100 million shares, so you're talking $60 million, I would tell you that, cash wise, probably 80%, 85% of that $60 million will be cash depression that we get from -- that will occur over the next 15 months.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "And of that 85%, Sean, how would you break that down between the ongoing operating loss there or the startup operating loss, and then voluntary expenditures when Sherwin-Williams integrate the business?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would probably cut the 80% about 70-30, 30% cost of integration and closing cost, 70% from the operation. Then, I think, by that time, then the operations will be cash positive in 2015 -- 2016, very nicely, cash positive.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. How should we think about capital expenditures for next year? I don't think there would be a lot to go with what you've already purchased from Comex. But if you can give us perhaps a scenario to consider if you do indeed get your wish and the deal with Mexico -- with Mexican assets goes forward?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think that if you look at the core, I think just when you think about increasing the number of stores, the CapEx will be up this year just in the core piece. I think that there are -- some of the -- majority of the stores that we just -- the 306, are long-term stores for us, long-term markets. And I think you're going to see us put some CapEx into those. I'll just sort of put this answer in that 3. So I think store CapEx is going to be up because of increased stores. Number 2, these stores, we are going to put some POS devices in the [indiscernible] stores, shaking equipment, I mean tinting equipment, color equipment that we have. And then, if we complete Comex, there'll be another step change there, Chuck, that if we do complete it, we'll give you that number.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. And how should we think about share repurchases in light of how these deals shape up? Originally, you indicated you would abstain for most repo activity because of the size of the deal. Now it's taken place in cases and you have bought back some in the most recent quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think that what really motivated us there to buy back stock is when you look at the cash generation, Chuck, if you look at our cash generation, and in Chris' comments, he talked about 10%. We've never been at 10% of sales through the third quarter in our history, and I think that's huge because, as you know, we're negative in the first quarter. It used to be if we could be slightly positive through the second quarter, we were over 4% year-to-date. And now we're over 10% for the first time in the third quarter. And I think we've consistently said that we're not going to hold cash. We feel that the cash generation from the acquisition will take care of itself. And we're going to buy back stock with that cash. We're not going to hold it.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "That's great. One last question. Just because I don't think anybody mentioned it, paint stores pricing in the third quarter, I'm going to take that that was flattish?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "A couple of quick questions. On Comex in the U.S., you talked about being more focused on the new residential construction. Will that be -- if that goes through next year, will that be a drag a little bit on your mix as you get new products in there that would be noticeable? And then, also, with the losses, is this going to help or how do you expect your tax rate to be impacted next year, assuming just the U.S. assets?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Ivan, on the drag of Comex. I think that it's $500 million. It's not a small piece when you think about the Stores group. But in total, the gross margins and the operating margins won't be a drag on stores group. On the selling price, I don't think that -- as time goes on, it will be slightly. But I think that there's no doubt that the operating margin in the Stores group next year, because of that $0.60 to $0.65, will be a drag. On the tax rate, again, we think that if we do complete the Comex acquisition, that could give us an opportunity to have a step change in our tax rate. The U.S. piece is going to change -- is going to have that kind of a step change.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "I just wanted to understand a little bit on the Latin American piece. You've done over the 2 quarters as far as paying the Brazilian duty catch-up for 2 years. So in the fourth quarter, should we expect the margins in this business to sort of get back to whatever normal level is on a year-over-year basis, something in the mid to high single-digits? Or is it that we're going to see a sort of a drag in the business that goes beyond the Brazilian duties?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So you're correct that the Brazilian import tax issue is behind us. So that will not be recurring or anything from that in the fourth quarter. We'll be back to the business' performance. I think what you'll see there, Dmitry, is the impact that we've been talking about for a while now on just the softening market conditions as well as the currency impact in the margins. Don't forget that Latin America, like all of the coatings businesses, buy their raw materials on a dollar-denominated basis. And so despite the fact that we can manufacture and sell in-country, we do have this impact of a global dollar denominator raw material, and we shared with you in the past the sizable amount of cost facility with our raw material basket. So we're probably going to see Latin American margins running lower than their normal run rate, even after this tax issue, and that will rebound as pricing activities take place, raw materials moderate and the dollar versus local currencies gets back online.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just I know the question was asked about this already, but I couldn't follow the answer, so maybe I'll ask it again. The seasonal shipments that you mentioned in the Consumer business, I think, you said they took place in September, which improved the growth in that division in the third quarter. Was that sort of pulled forward from the fourth quarter? How should we think about the Consumer business performance in the fourth quarter, understanding that it's going up against somewhat tougher comp as well?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So unlike our stores business, where every single days sales are reported based on the gallons that go out the door, consumers selling into supply chain of our customers, and so whatever their inventory needs are, stocking issues are, can impact a quarter like this. And we've commented on this in years past. There were just a couple of our customers that placed significantly stronger orders on the business in September than we had forecasted for. And their businesses are doing well and maybe we won't see a fall from that, but our guidance for the fourth quarter would be that the consumer segment will post the same kind of numbers that we've been seeing throughout the year and that we expect them to be negative for the year in the low single-digit range.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. That's helpful. Then finally, and that leads me to my next question. From what you're seeing your store growth at least, because you get out a little bit sooner, with the feedback loop, how is the October looking as far as [indiscernible], 5-year day [ph], the weather up until recently has been rather warm, so I would expect the [indiscernible] to extend a little bit. Are you benefiting from that in the month of October from what you can see?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Dmitry, I had 4 inches of snow in my house yesterday, so I'm not sure I'm buying the extension of this beautiful Indian summer across America. I think we've been pretty consistent over the years in not commenting or blaming weather either for goodness or difficult times. We're going to have pockets of good and bad weather in every quarter across the country. I think this will be a very typical fourth quarter for the industry in terms of kind of demand cycle. And certainly, there are those jobs that you pointed out that we're seeing next year work still being wrapped up, but those are coming to an end quickly and it should be a pretty stable mix environment, as it would've been historically.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. And the last question on the store openings as opposed to Comex. You're accelerating your fourth quarter store openings, as you've done in the last year or 2. But you're going to be adding over 300 stores in Comex, it sounds like you're going to have your hands full in getting those stores' product life and customers over the line with the market. How should we think about your store openings sort of in 2014 and maybe 2015 before the Comex integration is completed?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We'll have a lot more clarity on that in January call, Dmitry. But what I would comment is that we have consistently said for quite some time now that we see 5,000 stores as a reasonable expectation in North America. And we have an infrastructure in place that knows how to get these stores sourced, discovered, built, opened and running. I don't think you'll see us fall off that 80 to 90 base at all going toward next year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "First question. Just with the revenue trend, I guess, in the third quarter organically, we get to about a 9% growth number and you're guiding to 5% to 7% in the fourth. Obviously, there's a lot of stuff that goes into that timing-wise and year ago comps. As you guys plan for fourth quarter, are you thinking on a seasonally adjusted basis that demand is stable, up or down relative to the third quarter?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think it's stable. I think that we feel very good about the stableness of 3 segments. The one piece that I think that Chris did mention in our guidance is we do not have the fourth quarter repeating and over 5% sales gain in the Consumer group.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. And then for the Comex stores domestically, can you just compare and contrast the physical either location of the stores or size of the stores relative to a typical Sherwin store? Is the capacity of those stores on the revenue side similar or different?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Very similar, Dennis. They would be a typical 4,000 to 5,000 square foot box, which is right in line with ours. I think every single one of these 300 stores is leased, Sean, if I'm not mistaken?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Christopher M. Connor", "So they're all leasehold locations. They would be in fairly similar traffic pattern locations, standalone facilities in small strip centers. I would say there's a good number of these that are in locations that we have coveted to be and we're actually pleased to get a number of outstanding paint stores in new neighborhoods that we currently -- in that locations. And nothing about the physical locations or box size of these stores will limit our ability to run them at the same kind of average store sales or productivity that we get out of our current format.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Margin in the quarter excluding the Brazilian import duties, it looks like the overall gross margin was 46, which is the upper end of that range that you historically have talked about or recently talked about getting to. Curious on how you think about where gross margins go from here also in regards to pricing and mix? And again, obviously, without Comex, where you think the gross margin path might go over the next 6 or 12 months for the company?", "Robert J. Wells", "We feel pretty good about the quarter, Eric. We actually grow 46 1 without -- well, we computed but when you look at it, for the full year, we're in that mid 40, 45. Last quarter, we talked about that we think the full year was going to be right in between that 45 year-to-date that we were at the end of the second quarter and the high end of 46. We feel good about this, that we're in that same answer. A couple of things. Number one, LIFO last year was a big nice improvement. We were 43 9 going into that fourth quarter, we're now at 44 8. We're not going to have a 9/10 improvement between year-to-date and the fourth quarter this year. And it's because that LIFO credit that we brought back in the fourth quarter, the way raws came in. You're right that Comex will depress our gross margin a little bit, but I think that we still feel good about where our gross margin is. I think that the volatility in raw materials seems to be a little calmer as with the business. Markets that Chris mentioned, a little more confident in the market and the volumes tremendously more stable than they were in '09 and '10. I think that our gross margin stays in the range we're in right now, depressed a little bit by the Comex, but improved because of the volumes that we're putting through subgroup.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Nils Wallin of CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Just on Comex, bringing the negative margin in that business to positive and to actually accretive in the U.S. stores, what needs to happen from rationalization, from a new product and then just from normal market growth? What -- those 3 buckets, what needs to happen in order to get to your goal?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think, a good way to about this, Nils, is no different than Sherwin opening a new store in kind of the ramp from dilutive impact up to contributing and eventually, when you're 3 or 4 running kind of on a comp store profitability level. So what needs to happen here is mostly productivity. We need more volume, more gallons going through those boxes than they've been enjoying. I think Sean has done a nice job of taking you through the cost impact that were diluted. As we rationalized, we comment on maybe 10% to 15% store count needs to come out. There'll be some SG&A adds to strengthen the stores staffing in these facilities. But it's pretty much the same kind of blocking impact that we do each and every day in these districts to service these customers that we know how to do, and we expect we can get these volumes up to the level where they'll be performing. And I think, Sean made the comment, accretive by 2015. And by 2016, really accretive. So therein lies the path forward.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Got it. And just because of the timing differences between the Comex U.S. -- Canada and Comex Mexico, assuming that the commission has a favorable decision, is there anything that changes, besides obviously just the timing, is there anything that changes the pace of integration? Do they -- are they dependent at all on one another?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, 2 entirely different businesses, run separately by Comex, for that matter. So our integration teams are entirely different. We moved forward on this U.S. and Canadian teams because it entirely resides inside our Paint Store Group. And that team was ready, chomping at the bit and wanting to go. And then, of course, the Mexican piece will be embedded in our Latin American Coatings Group. An equally talented team down there prepared to get engaged when that one comes. No issues at all bifurcating these transactions from an integration standpoint.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Great. And then, just finally, the same-store sales growth, is there -- were you taking any share? Because it certainly was a dramatic year-on-year improvement.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think, we have to assume we were. We've seen the release of some of our public competitors. Bob commented earlier on the call, this is the kind of market environment where we think gallons are growing in that mid single-digit range and our gallons were double-digit. So we're feeling good about the share position of the company right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Did you say how fast you could close Comex deal if you get a favorable ruling next week?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes. We didn't say it. But I think, Chris used the word prompt. And it really depends on if we get next week, I mean, we'd like to do it October 1 -- or I'm sorry, November 1.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Yes, October 1 would be great. Secondly, if you get surprised by the lead paint ruling, is the appeal process any different for a bench case versus what you paid in Rhode Island that was a jury case?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, John. To our knowledge, it's the same. And it's likely a multiyear process.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And then just thirdly, above average growth that you're seeing relative to the market, do you think that's just professionally applied paint versus DIY? I would think there's more recovery comment in the professional painter market than DIY just because DIY doesn't cycle as much?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think you're right on that. We certainly are benefiting from the rebound in the professional painting contractor. That will be a portion of the share gain. I do think that some of these gallons are coming from our competitors as well.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Don Carson of Susquehanna Financial Group.", "Christopher Noon - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "This is Chris Noon stepping in for Don. Most of my questions have been answered. But I guess, you guys have given some color on U.S. architectural volume growth year-to-date and I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on why you've been outpacing it in the year and why you feel confident that you'll be able to continue outpacing the market?", "Robert J. Wells", "Well, yes, Chris, I think it is a combination of factors that have led to our Paint Stores Group outpacing market growth. I mean, number one, we were among -- we were in very rare company opening stores during this downturn, and as a result, we're emerging into the recovery with a much higher store count and with mature stores in markets where we didn't have them prior to the downturn. Secondly, as was indicated earlier by John, just in the previous question, the painting contractor market appears to be growing faster than the DIY market, and that is where the majority of our exposure is in Paint Stores Group. We introduced a lot of new product lines during this downturn that are getting traction. So there's a whole -- and we've made significant investments in SG&A in store service level, which certainly helps attract new customers and more business from current customers in the recovery. So it's a broad combination of factors.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Next question comes from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.", "Richard O'Reilly", "I was also going to ask about the weather because in New Jersey, it's been beautiful here, but I think you've already answered that. But on the same-store, it was up 10.9%, 1 year ago, it was up 8.9%, so that's an average of about 10%. Do you think that's a real number or is that the year-to-date, the 7.4% of data [ph] number that we should be looking at?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, I think, the 7.4% is the better number. I mean, there's 9 months of activity there. If the market's growing in the mid single-digit range and we're running at 7.5% on revenue and volume is a little bit higher, that's a pretty strong performance. I think that's more kind of typical. We have had periods of time in rebounding markets where we posted multiple quarters in a row of double-digit comp store sales gains, but we've never been one to give that kind of robust guidance. And so I think, the 7.4% feels about right.", "Operator", "At this time, we've come to the end of our question-and-answer session for today. I'll now turn the floor back over to Bob Wells for closing comments.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, Rob. We appreciate all of you joining us on the call this morning. As usual, I will be available over the balance of the day and Monday for any follow-up questions you might have. Thanks again for your participation and thank you for interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I will now turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Tyler Treat, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Tyler N. Treat", "Good morning. Welcome to our Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. We have 2 speakers today who will provide insight on our business, the fourth quarter and full year results we announced this morning and perspective on our guidance for fiscal year 2014: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, Valspar's Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valsparglobal.com.", "And finally, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report on our Form 10-K. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Hendrickson.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Thank you, Tyler, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results and our improved sales momentum going into fiscal 2014. After a few highlights on the quarter, I will give you my perspective on last year and our outlook for 2014. Jim will provide more details in his remarks.", "Our sales growth in the fourth quarter was strong. Sales increased 8%, and volume grew 15%. Excluding acquisitions, our sales increased mid-single digits. This growth was driven by new business wins in all of our major product lines. And as the U.S. market improves, particularly areas impacted by strengthening residential housing and construction spending, the benefit of our new business wins becomes more evident in our overall results.", "In the U.S., we had sales growth of 12%, and volumes were up over 20%. We have had good sales performance in the U.S. all year, and that trend continued to strengthen in Q4. Our international sales were up low-single digits including Inver, down low-single digits excluding Inver, which is a continuation of the trend we have seen all year. Overall, it was a good quarter. We delivered sales and earnings at the high end of our expectations. Earnings per share increased 13% over last year.", "Reflecting on the full year, we did not fully achieve the financial targets we set at the beginning of 2013. This was largely due to weakness in certain product lines in international regions following a very strong 2012. I am, however, pleased with the progress we made on our growth initiatives, new business wins and productivity programs. We also completed 2 outstanding acquisitions during the year, Ace and Inver.", "2013 was a very strong year of new business execution. We delivered mid-single digit net new business growth in both our Paints and Coatings segments. We won significant new business in our packaging product line, particularly in the beverage can market, and we increased our sales of non-BPA products. The beverage can market is growing, particularly in Asia and Europe. Our volumes in packaging coatings were up high-single digits in the year.", "Our coil and wood product lines also delivered significant new business in the year. Wood sales grew in the high-single digits with over half that growth coming from new business wins in both the U.S. and China. In China, we added new distributors; and in the U.S., we won business at key building products customers, which should grow nicely with the tailwinds from the U.S. housing recovery. In coil, our new business was driven by new technology in the metal building market. We strengthened our general, industrial and European business through the acquisition of Inver, expanding our presence in the large European coatings market and gaining a proven distribution model.", "A notable performance in the year was the North American consumer Paints business, which delivered 16% sales growth and 29% volume growth. Excluding the Ace acquisition, our sales grew in the high-single digits. The business introduced a new line of Pro products at Lowe's and sales for this program have been very positive. Also contributing to Paint growth is our new business with Ace. We are manufacturing all of the Private Label paint volume for Ace, and over 500 Ace stores have been reconfigured for the Valspar Paint program.", "We also remained focused on enhancing shareholder returns. We repurchased 5.9 million shares of the company's stock, an investment of $378 million. We also returned $81 million to shareholders through quarterly dividends. This morning, we announced our board approved a 13% dividend increase, marking our 36th consecutive year of increased dividends per share.", "Looking forward, I expect a better year in 2014. We are planning for sales growth to increase 7% to 9% and for double-digit EPS growth. Jim will talk more about our 2014 plan in his remarks. But in short, our sales growth will be driven by the full year impact of Inver, the carry-over impact of our new business wins along with the continued focus on winning new business across all of our product lines. The investments we made in 2013 to enable growth will be more impactful in 2014. This benefit, along with restructuring actions and solid productivity plans we have in place position us well for a strong 2014.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jim, who will provide some additional context on the 2013 results and guidance for this year.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest in Valspar. I'd like to provide an overview of the key financial highlights from the quarter and our performance in fiscal '13. This background should provide helpful context as I move on to discuss our expectations for fiscal 2014. After the call, I encourage you to follow up with Tyler in the IR team with questions on the year-end details or assumptions for the next fiscal year.", "Let's begin with the Q4 highlights. On last quarter's call, we noted that fourth quarter sales were expected to grow mid- to high-single digits and that full year adjusted EPS was anticipated to finish in the range of $3.45 to $3.55. The results we announced today are in line with those expectations.", "Sales in Q4 increased 8% and represented our strongest growth quarter of the year. Key contributors to this increase included very strong performance in the U.S. market led by consumer paints in both the big-box channel and continued growth with Ace Hardware. Total sales growth in U.S. Paints was over 30% in the quarter. We also saw high-single-digit growth in wood and coil coatings products and a high-single-digit decline in sales from general industrial products as has been the case all year. Altogether, sales in the U.S. increased 12% in Q4.", "Now turning to international sales. Sales in Europe increased driven by the addition of Inver and from improved sales in packaging coatings. The acquisition of Inver increased total company sales by approximately 3% in Q4. Sales in Asia were flat, as strong growth from the wood product line was essentially offset by lower sales in the balance of the businesses in this region. Latin American sales, excluding FX, were down slightly. In Australia, sales, excluding the impact of FX, declined mid-single digits in a professional market that was down high-single digits. Our results in Q4 were better than we had experienced in previous quarters.", "According to recent industry data from the Australian Paint Manufacturers' association (sic) [Federation], we gained market share in both the trade and retail channels from the previous quarter. We are also growing our retail position with Masters Home Improvement stores. We recently displaced the market-leading Dulux brand at Masters and introduced the Valspar-branded products at the super-premium price point with a full range of interior and exterior products. We still have a long way to go to fully achieve our objective in this market, but these data points demonstrate that we are making progress.", "The gross margin rate in Q4 of 33.4% was 60 basis points below last year, reflecting the mix impact from the addition of the Inver business and sales of Ace Private Label paints versus last year. As a reminder, we expect the near-term dilutive impact from Ace to improve in the second half of fiscal '14 as we exit redundant manufacturing costs and begin selling a higher mix of branded Valspar products. As Gary mentioned, we feel very good about the acceptance levels experienced to date in the Ace network, and we remain on track with our plans.", "SG&A expense as a percent of sales finished at 20.8%, an improvement of 70 basis points. The improvement in rate was driven by leverage from higher sales in the quarter and reduced incentive compensation expense tied to our performance for the year.", "Looking at the results in our Paints and Coatings segments for the quarter. Paints sales increased 13% led by double-digit growth in the U.S., offset by continued headwinds in China and Australia. EBIT margins finished at 11%, which was 35 basis points below last year and reflected our investment in growing the business and the dilutive impact from Ace.", "Coatings segment sales improved 5% in Q4, as the addition of Inver and sales increases in the wood product line were partially offset by declines in the general industrial product line. EBIT margins of 15.5% were down 125 basis points. This reduction is primarily the result of Inver, which has lower EBIT margins than our other Coatings businesses and from the continued mix impact of lower sales in several higher-margin product lines. Bringing it all together, Q4 operating income increased 9%, and adjusted EPS improved 13% versus the prior year.", "Looking back at that year in total, we had a number of big successes and key business wins. However, some of this good progress was muted in our results due to lower industry demand in several end markets and regions during the year. We improved sales 4% in the Paints segment in 2013. This growth was driven by very strong performance in the U.S. as the housing market continued to improve and through significant new business wins. Sales growth in the U.S. was partially offset by more difficult macro conditions in Australia and a slower housing market in China versus the previous year. Coatings segment sales for the year increased 2%. When you look closer at the details behind this growth, there is some good progress that took place in the year. Our wood and coil businesses had a good year with sales growth in the mid-single digits. In packaging coatings, we won new business and increased volumes high-single digits. We completed the year with the acquisition of Inver in Q4, which provides a platform for industrial coatings growth in Europe.", "The growth challenges in the Coatings segment during the year were largely focused on general industrial markets, especially off-road, shipping container and pipe coatings. Each of these areas experienced lower end-market demand coupled, in some cases, with large customer inventory reductions. These product lines have historically been strong performers in our portfolio and remain well positioned for profitable growth as these markets recover over time. In total, we finished fiscal 2013 with operating income up 5% and operating margin expansion of 30 basis points to 12.9%.", "During 2013, we invested in value-creating restructuring programs to position Valspar for future growth and lower our cost structure. These initiatives included reducing our North American manufacturing footprint, restructuring our European manufacturing operations with the synergies provided by the Inver acquisition and by lowering our overhead in each region. Spending on these activities will carry over into the new fiscal year and will provide productivity benefits for 2014 and beyond.", "We improved our working capital position and continued to generate strong cash flow in the year. Working capital improved to 12.7% of sales, excluding acquisitions, as we took action to manage inventories and improve our payable positions versus the previous year. Cash from operations increased 14%, and free cash flow, defined as cash from operations less CapEx and dividends, finished the year at approximately $200 million. We utilized a portion of this cash to improve shareholder returns through increased dividends and share repurchases as Gary summarized earlier. With this as context on fiscal '13, I'd like to move on and discuss our expectations for fiscal 2014.", "In fiscal 2014, we expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $3.95 to $4.15, reflecting growth of 12% to 17%. Included in this guidance are the following assumptions: total sales growth of 7% to 9%, reflecting the full year impact of the Inver acquisition; carry-over benefits from new business initiatives, like Lowe's Pro, Ace, B&Q and in packaging coatings; and new business wins anticipated during the year. These items are expected to drive higher sales in both the Paints and Coatings segments in fiscal 2014 than the previous year.", "We expect additional benefits from restructuring investments and productivity initiatives in 2014. A portion of these benefits will be used to fund continued investments in growth initiatives and higher year-over-year incentive compensation expense. We also expect an effective tax rate of approximately 32% to 33% and CapEx of approximately $120 million. And finally, while not included in our adjusted EPS guidance, we expect restructuring expenses in the range of $35 million to $40 million related to the carryover of the initiatives we announced in fiscal 2013.", "In closing, Valspar has a strong portfolio of businesses with leadership positions in attractive markets. Our plans for fiscal 2014 focus on winning in the near term and building future growth to enhance returns for our shareholders.", "With that, we would like to open up the call and take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Don Carson at Susquehanna.", "Christopher Noon - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "This is actually Chris Noon stepping in for Don. First, starting out, looking at the Paints segment, sales were really strong in the quarter, 13.4%. I'm wondering if you can kind of give us some more color and dig into how much each of those different initiatives contributed to that growth in the quarter and then also how you think each of those can contribute to the growth going out into '14.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, sure, Chris. This is Gary speaking. So North America, as Jim mentioned, we had a fantastic quarter in North America sales, up mid-30s in percentage terms. About half of that was shipments to Ace, both the Private Label shipments and we also started shipping the Valspar program in the quarter. Sell-through in the quarter was strong. We had sell-through in the -- at retail in the high-single digits across our distribution partners. And then the rest of it would be the Pro program at Lowe's, which we didn't have in the previous year and built a little bit of inventory that needed to be built in various channels to support the strong POS. So that was North America. As Jim mentioned, we -- Australia, although we made terrific, I think, sequential improvement in the Australia business in the quarter, was still a drag on the results. And Asia was also down kind of mid-single digits against a very, very strong quarter in 2012, and we were building inventory to support the affordable housing initiative that we had launched in that year. So yes, it was a good quarter. The major contributor was North America. But as I -- I'll repeat, Australia made great progress, and Asia had a good quarter in the context of a comparison against a very, very tough 2012.", "Christopher Noon - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then my second question is on the guidance range. You said top line is expected to be 7% to 9%. Can you maybe just go into a little bit how much of that is new business versus, I guess, kind of organic versus acquisitions?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, happy to, Chris. It's Jim. So as you look at that 7% to 9% range for next year, first off, I'd say one of the things that we want to provide investors with transparency to is just a view of what our overall sales profile for next year looks like in light of the significant new business wins we've achieved this year. As you know, the company hasn't historically provided specific guidance around the top line, but Gary and I felt it was important, given the significant new business wins and how we've talked about the different markets developing all year long, that we give you a little more color to assist you in your view of next year. So as you look that 7% to 9%, really, I would break it into a couple of big pieces. We're going to continue to have the benefit of the acquisition of Inver, which was initially recorded in the current year and in FY '13 starting just in the fourth quarter. So we're going to get a full year benefit from that. Call that roughly half of the growth in the top line next year. The other half of the growth is primarily coming from what I'll just bundle together as net new business consistent with what we delivered in -- at fiscal '13. That new business is going to include the continued build-out of the Ace program, the Lowe's Pro Initiatives, the further shipments that will be due next year around B&Q and certainly reflects the new business wins we've seen in other product lines like the packaging business for the year. So really, the other half the business is coming from kind of the organic growth levers that we've seen from a new business standpoint with the balance being driven by acquisition of Inver.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. First off, just want to get your thoughts on the European region and your legacy business there, just in the context that it seems that the Inver acquisition is proceeding pretty well for you. What are some of the end markets that are driving that solid performance with Inver?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, it's Gary. Our legacy business in Europe is mainly packaging coatings. So we have -- and we had a small industrial business, less than $100 million industrial business. So we tripled the size of our industrial business with the acquisition of Inver. So we have a -- we feel like we've got a much better balance of businesses in the European region right now. There are a number of strategic reasons that we did Inver, which I won't get into now. But I'll say that the integration process with Inver is going extremely well. We're very positive about the business, the synergies and the acceleration that Inver can provide us in strategic segments in Europe as a region. Inver had a -- and we only had 2 months of Inver, but we were ahead of our acquisition model in those 2 months. So -- but that doesn't really make a trend. But as I said, we're extremely positive about it. Packaging business had a very good quarter and they had a very good year in terms of new business growth. They took a significant market share in the region, and as Jim mentioned, in the quarter their sales were up mid-single digits. So those are our 2 legacy businesses. Packaging, we're very pleased with the quarter that they had and the year that we had. And we're just getting started with the, call it, the reinvention of Valspar industrial Europe.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And as a follow-up, for the Paints business, can you talk about inter-quarter trends? Were there any major variances month to month?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "No, it was a strong quarter for the whole -- the -- every month in the quarter was strong.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Your accrued liabilities went from about $340 million to $416 million sequentially. What's behind that?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, a couple of things, Jeff, is that when you look at the acquisition of Inver during the year, we're adding the accrued liabilities for that business. And then just as far as some of the timing of payments at year end and the restructuring expenses that we have in the business lifted that balance, so primarily driven by acquisition activity. Nothing else materially different year-over-year.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "How much did Inver add to your inventories and receivables in the quarter, rough terms?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, rough terms, it was about half of the growth we saw in the quarter. If you give me just one second, I'd be happy to look it up here for you.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Half of the growth year-over-year or half of the growth sequentially?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Always year-over-year. So Inver was about roughly $36 million of growth in inventory.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And receivables?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Don't have that number off the top of my head, Jeff. You want to follow up with Tyler to get the...", "Tyler N. Treat", "It's about $70 million, Jeff.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "$70 million.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "About $70 million.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Gary, just on the retail initiatives, is it still true that they were basically breakeven in 2013? And if so, what will they be from an EBIT basis margin or dollars in 2014?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, I'm not -- I couldn't even, if I'd wanted to, give you the exact number, David, but I'll repeat what Jim said relative to Ace. Ace will become accretive after we exit redundant manufacturing costs, which will take us about another 5 or 6 months. So we're calling it accretion in the second half of this year. The B&Q initiative in the year will still be slightly dilutive, less dilutive than it was this year. But really, those are really immaterial numbers, David. They're small numbers in the single-digit millions. And the Lowe's Pro business, we've built out the infrastructure to support that business now and we're -- the product is selling through, so we're at more or less the normalized run rates that we should see for that business today.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes and we'll see a full year impact of that in FY '14. Remember, we just set that business with Lowe's in the spring of '13.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Will Ace be positive in 2014 overall?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "It will be, yes.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Absolutely, yes.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then just lastly, restructuring wise, what will the benefit be in 2014 year-over-year?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. So we've talked to a couple of the components of the restructuring, what we -- the North American manufacturing restructuring, we anticipate that on a full year run-rate basis by the time we complete those activities in FY '14, it should be worth about $0.10 a year in EPS. We'll see that fully in FY '14. So in -- I'm sorry, in FY '15. In FY '14, we'll see it somewhere in the range of, I'd say, $0.04 to $0.06 from those initiatives. The other part of the restructuring portfolio really related to the Inver acquisition. And when you bundle all the activities we're doing with Inver along with the restructuring activities, we've previously called out about $0.10 of accretion next year for Inver in total including restructuring.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "I wondered if you could give us an update on raw materials. How did those trend during the quarter? And what's kind of your outlook for 2014?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "They were pretty much flat during the quarter, Kevin, and our outlook is for, let's just say, modest inflation in '14.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And looking at the B&Q rollout, where do you stand on that today? How many stores are you supplying? And when do you expect those to be fully stocked in all 350 or so B&Q stores?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes. So we're just now starting. We've had 30 set for at least a quarter, maybe as much as 2 quarters, Kevin, and really just learning more about the partner program with B&Q. So now we're -- we've entered into the phase where we're going to start rolling them out very quickly. And the objective is to have all 350 stores set by June.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "Okay, great. And final question, it sounded like you saw a bit of a pickup in Australia sequentially, not year-over-year but sequentially. Was this entirely due to the new business wins replacing Dulux at Masters? Or did you see some organic growth as well?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, no, the new business wins at Masters were not a driver of the improvement that I spoke about in the script. It's really the improvement in market share that we saw in both the retail and trade channel. We also anniversaried the actions we took last year to close unprofitable stores. And our team has done, I think, a wonderful job of executing better with our partners over there and building programs with the trade that are gaining traction. So as I mentioned, we've made good progress. We've got ways to go to. That housing market is going to continue to be challenged, but coupled with the restructuring activities we've done to improve the cost structure of the business and now seeing a little bit of stabilization in the top line, we're in a position to really benefit from the future growth as that market comes back.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was just trying to get a sense of what could be with the B&Q relationship, and I guess the most reasonable proxy would be what you do in the U.S. So can you sort of compare when this thing is at full rates and meeting your plans, how it compared to unit economics and sell-through and margins and those sorts of things that you might achieve in the U.S. currently?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "B&Q is an important first step for Valspar in our European consumer strategy, Bob. We don't expect that B&Q is going to be -- or in the short term, anything like the scale of the business that we have in North America. We're very pleased to have the opportunity to introduce our brand into the U.K. and Ireland market with a fantastic retailer. It'll be a good program for them. It'll be a good program for us. But it's really, for us, we think about it as the first step in our European strategy. We're not going to talk a lot at this stage about what the subsequent steps would be.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "All right. Let me shift gears, if I might, to Australia. You put in the branded product there. Is this something where we should expect that to continue to take a bigger and bigger share of shelf space there? And should we assume, as in the U.S., the branded product is going to come at a much more attractive margin than a private label?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, we've put -- so Bob, the way to think about it is Valspar is now part of the retail mix at Masters. It's positioned at the super-premium price point, the most expensive paint in the store. And we have developed a paint for that market which has features and attributes that support that positioning, extremely good paint. It becomes part of a mix with our Wattyl brands. Essentially, Valspar now has 75% to 90%. I don't know the exact number, Bob, but the vast majority of the shelf space at Masters with legacy Wattyl brands, the very strong brands that we acquired with Wattyl and now with Valspar. So it's a significant -- if you think about the rollout of Masters to 150 stores in the context of the business in Australia, it should be very good business for us.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "This is Andrew Dunn on for Ivan. Just Looking at your FY '14 sales expectations, you were nice to break those out. Just if you look at the international markets and general industrial market, would you say that your expectation baked in there is for flat or maybe even continued a little bit headwinds in those end markets?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, in general, we're anticipating just a little bit of continued headwind in those markets. Our guidance does not reflect the fact that they will be down as much as they were in FY '14. But as we've talked over the last couple of calls, we're not in the position to call when those markets are going to fully recover. So really, what's reflected in next year's view is not the same level of declines we saw this year and just a little bit of continuing headwind in the business.", "Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then you did mention some proliferation of your non-BPA coatings. Are you -- is it -- you guys, you're really starting to see some meaningful adoption now? And then related to that, is the market share that you're taking related to these products?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "The market share that we spoke about, Andrew, was not related to these products. It was mainly in beverage. Although that's the headline number I would say. We have taken market share in non-BPA coatings as well, but that segment of the overall packaging market is still small. So adoption is taking place. It's taking place at a measured pace, and we're participating in that with the technologies that we've developed. It's -- they're not huge numbers at this point in time, but I think the important point to take away is that -- for potential investor in Valspar is that we're the global leader in packaging coatings, and we've invested literally hundreds of millions of dollars, at least, maybe not $200 million but well over $100 million in developing new generations of coatings for the market that are -- that do not contain BPA. And if the market does accelerate and it switched, then we are extremely well positioned to win.", "Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one final question, if you could comment maybe a little bit more on trends in some of your secondary, more residential markets in China?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, I think China is -- you're talking about consumer, correct?", "Andrew Dunn - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Correct.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes. I think that, that market has stabilized. Let's say that. I'm not -- I won't go so far as to say that it's on a significant growth trend again, but I would say that in the last couple of quarters, our team there feels like the sentiment is slightly better as the market has stabilized. And the one market that has continued to grow is the affordable housing market, which is being supported by the Chinese government. That was responsible for a pretty significant shift in our business this year. We've been very successful launching products for the affordable housing market, and our volume growth in that segment was really strong in the year. So net-net, I feel like we are positioned for a reasonable year in China through the introduction of those new products in a market that's stabilized.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of John McNulty at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "A couple of things. First, on the cost of the program ramps that you've been working on, can you, first of all, quantify or give us some color as to what those costs are? And then also how much of them potentially drop off once the platforms are up and running versus kind of getting just overwhelmed with all the revenue coming in?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. John, it's Jim. I'm not going to go into the details of the cost of each of the programs. But to talk about the big drivers in general and how they're going to behave going forward, I think it would be best to characterize the costs we have incurred to roll out programs like Ace in a couple of folds: One is we're certainly investing in the marketing and the launch of that brand in conjunction with Ace in the stores next year. That will be part of an ongoing investment that we'll leverage even further once we get out of 2014, as we build more volume in the business. So we're going to have initial launch and marketing costs, but I would not put them in the category of onetime expenses that we'll take out of the business going forward. We'll just get more leverage from the sales lift that we see in that space. The other thing that we'll see, and we have a little bit of this going on with our Lowe's Pro Initiative as well, is one of the reasons Valspar is successful in partnering with retailers is that we bring value-added services in the way of helping train teams how to sell paint, actually helping them execute on the store and merchandise the shelves. We've invested both with B&Q -- I'm sorry, both with Lowe's on the Pro Initiative and with Ace in hiring people to do that in advance of the ramp of those volumes. So we incurred a lot of that expense this year. That's going to be in our run rate, that we'll be able to leverage the top line growth in both of those initiatives next year. And then lastly, as Gary mentioned, B&Q is a little bit of a different story. We're investing in the launch of that product in the marketplace. We'll have initial marketing expenses. We're working on a strategy to locally source the products over time, which will improve margins and will give us a little bit better run rate from an operating profit standpoint in that business. But as Gary also mentioned, we're not looking at that in the next 2 or 3 years as being a big bottom line driver of Valspar's total performance. We're very concerned about doing things well with B&Q in launching the brand successfully for both of us in that marketplace.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. No, that's helpful. And then just one other question with the Ace business. I believe you'd said in the opening remarks that you were in -- I wasn't sure if that you were in 500 stores with the Valspar brand or you've gotten 500 of the franchisees to sign up and you will be in those stores. So what was that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We are in over, as of this morning, over 550 stores that have been totally reset with the new paint department. And we have commitments from over 3,000 of the Ace dealers to take that program before May.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, so you're over -- so you're pretty much at 3/4 of all the franchisees tied into that platform. Is that about right?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, some of them probably more -- it's probably higher number than that, John, because a number of the Ace stores don't have a paint department. So if you did the math on the number of paint departments or number of Ace stores that actually do sell paint, we're probably closer to 80%, 85%.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of P. Juvekar with Citi.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So in off-road machinery and shipping containers, these segments have been weak for most of 2013. I guess, can you give us some color? Has the pace of weakness sort of started to moderate? And when can we start to anniversary sort of the worst of those sales declines?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, that's -- we haven't seen any material improvement in any of those markets, Dan, and none of our customers are talking about material improvements in those markets in 2014. And that's the way we've built our plan for the year.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And then on capital allocation, you made a real -- some really good progress in reducing your share count over the past 2 or 3 years. And like you said, you did a 4% reduction this year. So is this a pace that we should continue to expect in 2014?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, Dan, it's Jim. Certainly, the ability to invest in the business, pay dividends and as opportunities make themselves available, to do strategic acquisitions like Inver and continue to enhance shareholder returns through share repurchases, is part of what we think is a winning formula for shareholders. So we absolutely expect to continue share repurchases next year. The magnitude of which will depend upon the opportunities we see in the marketplace. What we said historically is, publicly, we're committed to offsetting dilution in the business, so a minimum of kind of 2%. We certainly purchased at a rate that's higher than that this year. And we continue to feel like we've got a great position to grow the business and enhance shareholder returns by continuing share repurchases. So we're not going to pin down to a certain percentage today, but it's still very much part of our playbook, and we seek significant opportunities over time to continue enhancing returns.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I guess first question, I think on the last call, you guys had said that the tax rate would be up in the fourth quarter, and it came in below what most people were expecting. So what changed there?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Charlie, it's Jim. The key thing that changed is that we had some favorable tax elements related to a couple of positions we had internationally that were outstanding that we got resolution on during the quarter. We had originally planned that those were going to happen more in next year, so we were pleased to see the acceleration of that. I guess from a big context standpoint, if I take those items out, we're basically in line with where we thought we were going to be. We just had a timing shift of those items.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then I just wanted to clarify something you said about the restructuring benefits that you're going to see in the Paint business, that $0.10 a year. Did you guys make a comment that part of that will be reinvested back in the business, so we won't see the full benefit of that in '14?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Two things, Charlie. What I was commenting on is one of the restructuring initiatives that we announced in 2014 -- sorry, in 2013 was in the second quarter, and it was really around restructuring part of our North American manufacturing base. Paint was just part of that restructure activity. What I was commenting is that the time we made those investments that we anticipated that we would see a run rate improvement in EPS of $0.10 by the time we got to FY '15. So I wasn't labeling that specific to the Paint business, number one. Number two is as we think about productivity next year and how we're going to manage our investments in the business, we're going to see benefits in productivity from those initiatives along with our normal productivity measures, but at the same time, we're going to continue supporting the important rollout of Ace, B&Q, Lowe's Pro and the other new business initiatives. So what I'm trying to set up is a stage of we're doing a good job managing productivity. We expect margins to continue to improve, but we're also going to be continuing to reinvest a portion of those margins in growing the business for the right reasons over the long term.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And it seems like some of the improvements that we're going to see next year you've called out as being back-end weighted. Any color you can give on overall sort of segment margins and the pace of EBIT growth through the year, I think, would be helpful to us.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, I think the comments that we provided around back-end weighting, Charlie, I think you must be attributing those to how we've been characterizing the portfolio improvement coming from Ace in the back half of the year. Certainly, as we look across the balance of the businesses, we're exiting with some pretty strong momentum this year. So from an overall back-end weighting standpoint, when you compare the growth that we saw in fiscal 2013, that was largely concentrated in Q3 and Q4. We're not looking at a weighting next year that looks consistent with that. We're going to have a little more balance in our weighting overall. But you're right to call out kind of in Q1, as we ramp some of those initiatives and as we look for productivity to increase as we get into the back half the year, we should see a little bit more upside in our overall margins.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "In your revenue guidance, you split it out between new businesses as part of the driver. That sort of implies maybe $160-or-so million of new business improvement next year. And I believe at one time, the expectation was with the Ace, B&Q and everything else to achieve around $400 million by 2015. So is it right to assume that you're expecting 40% in 2014 and another 60% in 2015 of your original $400 million?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, Nils, I wouldn't quite parse it that way. The $400 million of improvement that we're talking about historically is really related to the retail paint initiatives and what we expected over '13, '14 and '15. The new business growth run rate that you mentioned of roughly $160 million would include this year's increase from those components along with the increase that we expect to see in our packaging business from wins in that space and our general industrial business. So you really have to look at that build of $400 million. Part of it's in FY '13. Part of it's in '14. Part of it's in '15. What I'm trying to give a little more color on, as you think about the business in total, is, one, year-over-year, we're planning for about the same level of new business growth next year in '14 that we saw in '13; and two, the other additional growth that we'll see is coming from the full year benefit of having Inver in the portfolio.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Got it. I think in the second quarter, there was the expectation of around $18 million to $23 million in restructuring this year, and it came up -- came in much higher than that. Yet the guidance, I think, for the benefit is still $0.10. So could you help us understand, is it just that things are worse than expected? Or you have to do more to get that same $0.10? Or just trying to understand why the $0.10 isn't higher given the more restructuring that's been done.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "No, I think we're talking about apples and oranges a little bit, Nils. So what you're referring to is, back in Q2, when we talked about the North American restructuring, what we provided as an overview is the after-tax impact of the restructuring initiatives in the after-tax cost -- I'm sorry, yes, the after-tax cost. That was a 2-year number. So that was going to be incurred in FY '13, in FY '14. After Q2, we announced the acquisition of Inver, at which time, we said we were going to have higher restructuring expenses because we had a great opportunity to look at our European manufacturing base and close some facilities and move some other plant lines around, which was a great benefit for us as well. And then we also took some actions in the back half the year related to reducing our overall infrastructure costs and overhead in each of our regions. So the numbers you were referring to back in Q2, that was kind of the stage 1 of restructuring. Since then, we've kind of -- we've pulled the lever on a couple more initiatives with Inver and other items. So the total restructuring that you saw this year, roughly $36 million, is the combination of those 3 programs, not the one program that you referred to.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Understood. I wasn't sure if it was really apples to apples.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "No, that's fair.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "And then finally, haven't heard in a while the -- what's going on or how successful the introduction of the Valspar brand is in Tier 1 cities in China. Could you give us an update on that, please?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Still small. As we said, we're just -- we're, Nils, we're going to try a couple of tests and we're still testing, but it's still small. We're experiencing some success in the project channel, which is where we're focusing our efforts right now. Retail, we're still testing various models.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Could you talk about what you see in terms of M&A potential for 2014 and whether they would be more domestically or international?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, we did 2 great ones this year, Rosemarie. We did one domestically, and we did one internationally. And if we could do that again next year, I think we'd all be -- we'd be very pleased. And as always, we're talking to a number of different parties about those opportunities. But we -- we're never going to comment ahead of time. M&A has been part of Valspar's DNA. We've done a lot of acquisitions over the years, and we'll continue to do them in the future.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "I guess, I was wondering if you were going to take a break while you absorb the last 2.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Not if we can help it.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then when you look at the -- when we look at the wood business, it grew mostly in North America or maybe I misunderstood. And I was wondering, linked to this, what was happening in China, if you are growing wood coming -- I mean, for exports type of business or is -- it is also growing in the domestic Chinese economy?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Both. So I'll just answer the question comprehensively I hope. North America wood had a very solid year this year with growth in the high-single digits. About half of that growth, we think, came with the market recovery, and about half of that growth came with new business wins. The same is true in China. They had a year that was actually stronger than -- in terms of growth, than the North American business did. And that came partly through improving exports and/or winning share with exporters and partly through growth in -- of our business in the domestic Chinese economy.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "Okay, that is very helpful. And one last question if I may. So there -- isn't there a regulation in Europe requiring coatings going into food application to be non-BPA?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "There is a forthcoming regulation in France, only in France, Rosemarie, that will affect -- could potentially ban BPA in food and beverage cans. And the industry is preparing for that eventuality, and we're participating in that preparation.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "So if France bans it, don't you think that Europe -- the rest of the European countries are going to do the same? And if so, how large is that market?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes. I would just be speculating on the first part of your question. The second part of your question, the packaging coatings market in Europe is the largest packaging coatings market in the globe, which is why you've heard me talk excitedly about our opportunity in Europe if the market does start converting to non-BPA coatings because our position in Europe is less in terms of market share, significantly less, than it is in North America, and we see the European market as a big opportunity for us to grow with our new technologies.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company, Inc.", "And when you are talking about this large market, is it all potential for conversion to non-BPA? Or does it apply only to certain segment?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Anything on the inside of a can, I suppose, is a potential part of the market that could shift. The exterior of the can, which is probably 25% or so of coatings that are sold there, probably won't switch in the short term. But the interior of the can, anything that touches food or beverages has a potential to switch.", "Operator", "And that will come from that line of Steve Swartz, First Analysis.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "So question about your revenue guidance for '14. If you back out Inver, that cuts it in half. You mentioned that you expect modest raw material inflation, so maybe you get 1% of pricing growth. So you're down to maybe 2.5% or 3.5% revenue growth and then that's -- if you back out the new business wins, that kind of implies that you expect your legacy business to be flat. And within the legacy business, you still have the Lowe's in North America growing. So are there markets where you actually expect them to continue to decline in FY '14?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "You've done your math extremely well, Steve.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Not that it will do anybody any good.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I would say this, to kind of wrap the call, is that we -- first of all, we're going to have a little bit of an FX headwind that you may not have in your model. In the Australia -- the Australian dollar has declined pretty precipitously in the last couple of quarters, mostly in the fourth quarter. The Brazilian real declined precipitously. So we've got some FX headwind that you may not have modeled. And I would say revenue -- our revenue guidance may be somewhat on the conservative side in the sense that we're not expecting any recovery in these industrial markets and in the context of a pretty tough year this year. So I'll just leave it at that.", "Tyler N. Treat", "Okay, thanks, everyone, for participating in our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Follow-up questions from investors and analysts can be directed to me, Tyler Treat, my contact information in this morning's press release. Thank you, and that concludes our call.", "Operator", "Thank you.

In order to allow more time for questions, we've provided balance sheet items and other statistical data on our website at sherwin.com, under Investor Relations 2013 Year End Press Release.", "Summarizing overall company performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased 10.6% to $2.46 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume to our Paint Stores Group and acquisitions. For the full year, sales increased 6.8% to $10.19 billion. Sales from acquisitions increased consolidated net sales approximately 4.6% in the quarter and 1.8% in the full year. Currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.1% in the quarter and 0.8% for the full year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 45.8% of sales from 44.8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase in gross margin in the quarter was primarily due to improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes, partially offset by lower gross margin sales by the U.S. and Canadian stores acquired from Comex.", "For the year, gross margin increased to 45.3% of sales from 44.1% last year. The increase in gross margin for the year was primarily due to increased production volumes, partially offset by import duty assessments related to our Brazilian operation and dilution from acquisitions.", "Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars increased $70.2 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, but decreased, as a percent of sales, to 39.2% from 40.1% in the same quarter last year. For the full year 2013, SG&A expense increased $208 million to $3.47 billion but decreased, as a percent of sales, to 34% from 34.2% in 2012. The incremental SG&A from acquisitions, new stores and customer service investments accounted for the majority of SG&A increase in the year.", "Interest expense for the quarter increased $5.1 million to $16.9 million. For the year, interest expense was $62.7 million compared to $42.8 million in 2012. Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter 2013 decreased to 22.2% from 27.8% in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, our effective tax rate was 30.7% compared to 30.4% in 2012. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year was favorably impacted by the integration of Comex stores. The effective tax rate for the quarter and year without Comex would have been 32.3% and 32.1%, respectively.", "Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $48.1 million to $116.1 million. For the year, net income increased $121.5 million to $752.6 million. Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 4.7% from 3.1% last year. And for the year, net income as a percent of sales increased to 7.4% from 6.6% in 2012. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2013 increased to $1.14 per share from $0.65 per share in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, diluted net income per common share increased 20.6% to $7.26 per share from $6.02 per share in 2012.", "Now I'd like to review our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter increased 17.6% to $1.46 billion. For the year, net sales increased 10.9% to $6 billion. Sales increases in the quarter and year resulted from higher paint sales volume across all customer segments and acquisitions. Acquisitions increased net sales for the segment 7.5% in the quarter and 2.2% for the full year. Comparable store sales increased 9.2% in the quarter and 7.8% in the year. Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Southeast division led all divisions followed by Midwest division, Southwest division and Eastern division. Fourth quarter segment profit for the Paint Stores Group decreased to $168.5 million from $181.5 million in the fourth quarter last year, due primarily to a loss from acquisitions, partially offset by higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. Acquisitions reduced segment profit $40.4 million in the quarter. For full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 14.9% to $990.5 million from $861.8 million in 2012. The increase in segment profit for the quarter and year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expense and a loss from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced full year segment profit $43.1 million.", "Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter decreased to 11.5% from 14.6% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2013 increased to 16.5% from 15.9% in 2012.", "Turning now to our Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 6.6% to $272.6 million, due primarily to higher volume sales to most of the group's retail customers and to acquisitions. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 1.5% to $1.34 billion as a result of acquisitions, which more than offset the previously disclosed reduction in business with a large retail customer. Acquisitions increased net sales by 1.3% in the quarter and by 2.4% in the year. Segment profit for the fourth quarter increased to $36 million from $23.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. For the year, segment profit increased 11.9% to $242.1 million from $216.4 million in 2012. In both the quarter and full year, segment profit increased due primarily to higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by dilution from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced segment profit $2.3 million in the fourth quarter and $0.5 million in the full year.", "Consumer Group segment profit as a percent of net sales in the fourth quarter increased to 13.2% from 9.1% last year. For the year, segment profit margin increased to 18% from 16.4% in 2012.", "For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales increased 2% to $496.9 million, and full year sales increased 2.2% to $2 billion, due primarily to selling price increases and acquisitions, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Acquisitions increased the group sales in U.S. dollars by 1.1% in the quarter and 1.2% in the year. Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 0.2% in the quarter and decreased sales by 0.4% in the year. Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $37.7 million from $34.1 million last year. For the year, segment profit increased to $170.6 million from $147.2 million last year.", "In the quarter and the year, segment profit improvement resulted from increasing operating efficiencies and higher year-over-year selling prices. Unfavorable currency translation and acquisitions reduced segment profit $400,000 in the quarter and $500,000 in the year. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group operating profit was 7.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 7% last year and 8.5% for the year compared to 7.5% last year.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, net sales decreased 4% to $222.2 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 0.4% to $832.5 million for the full year due primarily to unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices.", "Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 9.4% in the quarter and 7.1% in the year.", "Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter decreased to $17.9 million from $30.1 million last year, due primarily to lower volume sales and unfavorable currency translation. For the year, segment profit decreased to $38.6 million from $81.2 million in 2012.", "Brazil tax assessments in the second and third quarters totaling $31.6 million accounted for most of the reduction in segment profit in the year. Unfavorable currency also contributed to full year profit shortfall. Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.7 million in the quarter and decreased profit $5.5 million in the year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit was 8.1% in the fourth quarter compared to 13% last year and 4.6% for the year compared to 9.7% in 2012.", "I'll conclude this review with a brief update on the status of our Lead Pigment Litigation. In the Santa Clara County case involving public nuisance claims brought by 10 California cities and counties against 5 defendant companies, Judge Kleinberg filed his final statement of decision on January 7, 2014. The decision orders 3 of the defendants, Sherwin-Williams, NL Industries and ConAgra, to pay $1.15 billion into a fund to be administered by the Childhood Lead Prevention program branch, a state agency that already receives funding from fees paid by major oil producers and paint companies. The 10 plaintiff jurisdictions must apply for grants from this fund to use on lead education, testing or abatement programs. Each jurisdiction has a maximum amount of money that they can use from this fund based on the number of pre-1980 homes in the jurisdiction. The ruling only applies to interior paint but does include encapsulation of some outside soil around homes. The plan is voluntary for homeowners and will be administered on a worst-go-first basis. Any money left in the fund after 4 years reverts to the defendants.", "Final judgment was entered on January 27th. From this final judgment, we will file post-trial motions and our notice of appeal. We expect to file our appeal to the 6th District Court of Appeals within the next 60 days and believe the process is likely to take 2 to 3 years.", "There was also a recent development in the Bank's case, which is a lead pigment case pending in Mississippi, involving claims by 5 individuals for lead poisoning allegedly to have occurred while they were children at a head start facility. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that Sherwin-Williams supplied paint containing lead to the facility for use on playground equipment. The trial court originally granted Sherwin-Williams summary judgment based on a lack of product identification. On January 16th of this year, the Mississippi Supreme Court reversed the lower court's dismissal, sending the case back to trial court for further proceedings. Additional discovery and subsequent motions for summary judgment are expected and no timetable has been established for further proceedings.", "That concludes my review of our results for fourth quarter and full year 2013, so I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2014. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. The financial results in the press release we issued this morning, as well as the numbers that Bob just walked you through, adhere to generally accepted accounting principles for financial reporting. That's the standard we prefer to follow because it's the most consistent and appropriate way to present our results. Although we don't use non-GAAP or pro forma or adjusted financial metrics in our earnings releases, in some cases, you can get a clear picture of how the core business perform by backing out the extraordinary items. The past 2 years are good examples. If you strip away the impact from acquisitions, tax assessments, Department of Label settlement and various other one-time items we incurred over the past 2 years, so we're comparing apples-to-apples, our core consolidated sales increased 5% in 2013 and our core earnings per share increased more than 17% or $6.49 per share to $7.60. This approach also helps to highlight the earnings leverage in our operating segments.", "For example, backing up the acquisitions from our Paint Stores Group, organic revenue growth for the year was just under 9% and flow-through on operating profit was more than 36%. On a GAAP basis, both Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group established new high watermarks for full year operating margins.", "Paint Stores' operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 16.5% and consumer segment operating margin increased to 18% from 16.4% last year. Global Finishes Group operating margin also improved 100 basis points year-over-year while the economic challenges and currency headwinds Bob discussed were too much for our Latin American coating segment to overcome. Although we anticipate further dilution from acquisition and integration this year, we also expect continued strong earnings leverage on organic revenue growth.", "We achieved 2 significant revenue milestones in 2013. Consolidated net sales for the company eclipsed $10 billion and our Paint Stores Group surpassed $6 billion in sales. Based on the midpoint of our sales guidance range for 2014 we'll add more than $1 billion in consolidated revenue this year, the majority of which will come from organic growth.", "For the first time in our history, net operating cash exceeded $1 billion, finishing the year at $1.1 billion, which is at 10.6% of sales. A portion of this increase came from our continued progress of reducing working capital requirements. Our working capital ratio was 10.5% of sales at year end compared to 10.8% of sales at the end of 2012. Once again, if you back up the effect of acquisitions, year-end working capital ratio would have been 10.0%, and that would have been an all-time low for the company.", "In 2013, our Paint Stores Group opened 82 net new stores and acquired an additional 306 locations under the Frazee, Parker, General, Kwal and ColorWheel brands, a total of 388 new locations. The integration of these stores and facilities in our existing operations is proceeding on schedule. We are delighted to welcome these outstanding men and women to our company and add these well-respected brands and products to our portfolio. At year end, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean was 3,908 locations.", "In 2014, we intend to ramp up our new store openings to a range of 80 to 90 additional locations. During the past year, we hired 1,400 new college graduates into our respective management training program to bolster our store staffing, improve our territory coverage and fill our store management pipeline. Although these investments tend to drive SG&A higher in the back half of the year, new stores and service employees pay for themselves over a very short period of time. At year end, our total debt was $1.72 billion and cash on hand was $745 million. We continue to manage our balance sheet in anticipation of closing the Mexican portion of the Comex transaction.", "During the year, we returned more than 90% of the net operating cash we've generated, $974 million to be exact, to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1.5 million shares of the company's stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 4.3 million shares, an average cost of $178.90 per share and a total investment of $769 million. At year end, we have remaining authorization to acquire another 12.15 million shares.", "We paid $205 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2013 marked our 35th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year, at our upcoming February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of a payout rate for 2014 consistent with our policy of 30% of prior year's earnings per share resulting in an annual dividend of approximately $2.20 per share, an increase of $0.10 -- 10% over 2013.", "We begin each year with some level of uncertainty, and 2014 is no exception. Data on the U.S. housing market had been mixed in recent months but we remain bullish based on current volume trends and feedback from many of our customers. Likewise, recovery in the domestic nonresidential construction market has been slow, but we have seen some improvement in our sales to this segment, nonetheless. We expect this positive momentum in this market segment to continue as well in 2014.", "Outside the U.S., it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation in many Latin American countries will remain a challenge. Modestly improving economic growth in Europe may provide some offset. Our raw material basket has many moving parts as well but in total, we believe there's some risk of modest inflation. Propylene, a key raw material feedstock, has increased in successive months to $0.73 per pound today from the low $0.60 per pound range a year ago. This will keep upward pressure on the price of monomers and latex in the first half of 2014. Increases in the price of high-density polyethylene will affect the cost of plastic pails. High-grade chloride titanium dioxide pricing held steady over the back half of 2013, but higher order volumes and lower inventories are driving factory utilization rates up, which could result in some pricing traction by mid year. Based on all of these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation for the paint and coatings industry to be in the low single-digit range in 2014.", "With these factors in mind, our outlook for the first quarter of 2014 is for consolidated net sales to increase 7% to 12% compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $0.95 to $1.15 per share compared to a $1.11 per share earned in the first quarter of 2013. Embedded in this guidance is our expectation that Comex stores in the U.S. and Canada will add approximately $97 million to $107 million to net sales, and reduce diluted net income per common share $0.15 to $0.25 per share in the quarter.", "For the full year 2014, we expect net sales will increase by 8% to 13% compared to full year 2013. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2014 will be in the range of $8.12 to $8.32 per share compared to $7.26 in 2013. This guidance anticipates that Comex stores in the U.S. and Canada will increase net sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and reduce earnings per share in the range of $0.45 to $0.55 per share for the full year of 2014.", "Again, we'd like to thank all of you for joining us this morning and we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is -- comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Chris, you mentioned the sort of upper single-digit, low double-digit revenue base and also some raw material inflation. Can you give us a sense of what pricing might do in 2014?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we can. In fact, we have announced some pricing to our stores, that's what we typically comment on. But we want to give you a little different feel for that this year. And Sean, maybe you can take the guide through that.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, this is Sean Hennessy. And as you mentioned in the past, we've been able to tell you when and how much selling price increases we have taken to the market. Due to the integration of the 5 brands acquired through the Comex, there are inconsistencies in when those things will occur, that do not really -- do not allow us to answer the question on pricing the same way as we have in the past. Our margin will be affected by the selling price increase that Chris just talked about and stores did go out in early January with some pricing. But the annualization of Comex, the foreign currency fluctuations, raw material changes that are going on, what we've thought of in the past, we've only given guidance on the annual basis looking at the sales and to the EPS. And just to give you some clarity on what's going to happen with pricing and how all this affects us is really to give you a gross margin range. Our gross margins will increase this year but we still believe we're in that 43% to 46% range. And this should tell you that we believe our total gross margin will be in the 45.5% to 46% range versus the 45.3% that we realized in the full year 2013.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just wanted to clarify on the comment that Chris made first. The 36% incremental margins in Paint Stores excluding the acquisitions, did I hear that right?", "Christopher M. Connor", "That's correct.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, very good. And then if you look at the $40.4 million of loss from the acquisition in that segment, can you break that down a little bit? How much was underlying business? How much was kind of inventory onetime step up or costs on the integration? I guess I'm just trying to get a sense, what was kind of the run rate of the business? I think we've talked about close to breakeven as it was coming into the portfolio, but just trying to understand the health of the businesses underlying that number?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, and a couple of things there -- again, this is Sean Hennessy, when you take a look at the sales curve that they have, they have a sales curve much like the Paint Stores Group for the second and third quarter, the highest sales quarters. So when you talk about annual might be flat but really when the fourth quarter is our toughest quarter because of the sales curve. When you look at that $40 million, approximately half of that was operating income, normal operating income. The other half was really onetime causes, inventory step up, other causes of expense that you mentioned. So that was about half and half, almost half and half is exactly. And just to remind you, when you look at that, as well as we're talking about that, that $40 million hit, we also mentioned that Comex was $0.13 dilutive for the year. And if you think where that $40 million segment was in the operating profit, the net effect from Comex was positively affected by tax savings and those tax savings were due to the integration of contingent liabilities. That integration was a positive $0.15 per share. And so when you -- and really, it really dealt a lot with the defined benefit plan. Our tax rate was 30.7% for the year that we reported. It would have been 32.1% really without that Comex and without that balance sheet integration. And our fourth quarter tax rate was 22.2%. It would have been 32.3% without the Comex. So in a way, that 40, that converts down to the $0.13. When you look at Chris' comments, that 45 to 50, mid point there is 50. There it is, $0.63. And I know last quarter, we've talked about the $0.60 to $0.65 dilution. We did give you 20 -- that $0.40 in the fourth quarter and we just experienced $0.11, but that $0.15 tax savings, actually it was -- we were not expecting to get that in the fourth quarter. So we actually were expecting to get that in the calendar year 2014. But we were able to accelerate that with the combination of defined benefit plan so it works out pretty well.", "Operator", "The next question is coming in the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Sean, maybe you could just expand on the continued liability tax savings. Is there any flow-through whatsoever into 2014 or was that all netted out in 4Q?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, we ended up -- we were able to get 100% of it in the fourth quarter, so that was nice.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on Latin America, can you just give us a more granular picture as it relates to the major countries there? Is the weakness broad-based, any impact on inflation from the currency devaluations in certain countries there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Sure, Ghansham. As we've commented in the past, Brazil is the second largest country of revenue for the corporation, Mexico would be third. And those happen to be the 2 economies that were probably hit the most. When we look at local currency performance for the business, our sales were up modestly. We held serve, I guess, is a good way to take a look at that as we went through the year. We are not expecting to see a lot of turnaround in Brazil going forward and I think we still have these currency devaluations. So Latin America has been the cycle for us. We've had a solid 10-year run down there where we had relatively flat currency and we're able to make some good inroads and we're kind of going through the other side of that right now. Our expectations, as we gave guidance, was that it wouldn't be a real help to the company next year.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And Chris, just to clarify that, on Brazil, specifically, does this sort of paradigm right now just affect your organic growth initiatives down there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Not so much. I mean, those are long-term plans that we have in place. So as you know, we are continuing to open our own dedicated company facilities, primarily in the northeastern part of the country. We continue to support our dealer network and convert to a more dedicated dealer format. So we haven't pulled back. We rarely do in a downturn. We keep pushing forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "You talked about or you can deduce from the press release that the revenues in Comex in the quarter were about $100 million. Order of magnitude, what are they in a seasonally strong quarter?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think when we've talked about this acquisition, we had told you that, at one point in time, when the entirety of the acquisition was being discussed, it's about a $1.5 billion transaction for the company. We said 1/3 of that was approximately in the United States, so $500 million for ease of math. So $100 million fourth quarter. And back to Sean's comment about the second and third quarters drive it. We just gave guidance that the first quarter for Comex revenue would be, again, about $100 million in the midpoint of that, so that all seems to kind of fit and tick and tie together, Jeff.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "So you're looking at about 20% in the fourth and third -- I'm sorry, the first -- 20% in the fourth and the first, 30% in the second and third.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, good. And then for my follow-up. Pretty much every year propylene goes up in the first quarter of the year and then comes back down because refineries turn around and so do ethylene crackers. So do you normally have some rise in your raw materials, in your propylene-based raw materials, in the first quarter and then they come off in the course of the year? Or now that the acrylics industry structure is a little bit tighter, do they tend to stay a little bit higher? Sort of can you discuss the progression of the normal propylene-based raw materials?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, Jeff, this is Bob. We've said in the past that, typically, it takes between 90 and 120 days for an increase in propylene to flow-through the acrylic chain and that's still the case. So I guess that would be saying, if propylene does follow its normal course and comes down after first quarter, it's likely we aren't going to see a lot of upward pressure in the acrylics and the solvents. But if it were to stay in the low to mid $0.70 per pound range, we'd likely see some modest upward pressure, primarily in acrylics in the middle part of the year.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Couple of things, one, I'm hoping you can clarify on the U.S. in terms of the bid process to get a proxy for your backlog, how things are looking there? And then I have a quick follow-up.", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, I think that when you -- when we look at the activity, that bidding activity, we feel pretty good about it. I think it -- occasionally, you'll see some weather affecting daily sales. But when you look at the demand, we feel pretty good about what's happening in America, in the United States.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "In terms of size of job as well, any sense of whether that's coming from non-res or res or can you tell?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think it's been pretty consistent, Aram, about the segments that we've commented on. Residential repaint has been terrific. And new residential construction, we've commented on that as well. Property management's doing well, given the rebound in the multifamily housing. So all those segments are doing well. We're not the kind of company that has a backlog or we see forward orders, I mean, painting contractors walk in that morning, we put paint in their truck and they walk out and get the job done. So to Sean's point, just kind of the flow and the rhythm and the feel of the business is very consistent with the guidance we've given.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And 2 quick housekeeping things, can you give us a sense as to what share count you've got assumed in that EPS guidance for '14? And also, Bob or Sean, if you know, often times, at the end of the year, you do a physical inventory adjustment and call that out in the K. I didn't know if that figure was available for us.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "As in the past, when you take a look at guidance and you look at it, we do have share buyback in our guidance, not really going to share that number, but we don't -- as we said earlier, we don't usually go down the P&L. But we do have some stock buybacks, we have uses of cash. On the other number for that adjustment, we don't have it right now in the physical inventory. I know it's going to be in the K, I just don't have it here in the room with me, sorry. And one more note on share count. We ended the year with actual shares outstanding of 100,129,380, so that's the starting point.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A quick question on the commercial market. Can you talk about what kind of contract or project backlog are you seeing for this spring and how does that compare with last year?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, I wouldn't describe the -- this is Bob again, I would not describe the commercial market right now, at this point, as being significantly backlogged. We are seeing a modest pickup in starts in the back half of 2013, which should translate to more paint projects by the back half of 2014. That would be in the mid to high single-digit range. So that the rebound in commercial construction has been slow to start, we are seeing a little bit of momentum building. I think the forecast for starts in 2014 are healthier than 2013, high single-digits. Some people are even going out on a limb with low teens numbers. But I think the good news in this is we're seeing more activity in the repaint market, which implies higher occupancy rates in office, retail and lodging and that should ultimately translate to higher square footage. As a reminder, commercial construction volume is still in the trough, so we've got a long ways to come back.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And secondly on TiO2. I think, Chris, you mentioned that producer inventories have come down. So as you get ready for the spring season, how do your inventories of TiO2 look like? And also you've been cautious on buying Chinese TiO2 in the past. Where do you stand on that?", "Christopher M. Connor", "In terms of our TiO2 inventory, they remain extremely steady and in line with our kind of production processes throughout the course of the year. We take the vast majority of this product in the United States in a slurry form. It's not the kind of thing that we can load up on excess inventory and sit on it. So we are at a pretty much a steady-state consistent inventory level based on the demand of production that we put on our factories. We have been increasing our purchases of some offshore titanium, mostly in the sulfite grade. We see more of that emerging in our Latin American operations. I think we've commented in the past that, at some point in time, perhaps 5% of our needs could be moved to that type and we're seeing some progress towards that.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I'm trying to understand, if you guys are including higher gross margins in your guidance, it seems like to get to your -- to the guidance, you'd have to assume some pretty sharp increases in SG&A or other costs in excess of what you've outlined for Comex. So, is that -- is there some reason why that's happening? Or any color that could help us understand the SG&A ramp I think would be helpful.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think we're continually -- we've continued to invest in the business, invest in new stores. I think we're going to open more stores in 2014 than in 2013. So the people and the reps and the infrastructure there, I think, that we're adding to that, that's going to increase the SG&A. And I think that we've continued to, on the admin side, continue to invest in IT projects that have allowed us to get our working capital down to an all-time low of net 10% and allowed the cash to go back over 10% of sales. And think that those things are good investments that we're spending in SG&A that are creating cash. And so, yes, we're investing in this business but I think the number one reason we're going to have SG&A growth next year is going to be the Comex acquisition. And then secondly is the continuing building out of the store chain in our stores group.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Is there a significant amount of expenses related to Comex Mexico and your efforts there and maybe you could highlight that as well?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No. I think we've been pretty prudent there. We do have ongoing expenses but I wouldn't call them material on our SG&A base.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And then finally, as a follow-up or housekeeping, if you guys could give the change in gross profit by segment?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. Okay. And -- for the quarter? Gross profit...", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, that would be great.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Consolidated was $128.7 million, as you know, Paint Stores Group was $80.9 million; Consumer Group, $27.4 million; Global Finishes, $8.6 million; and Latin America, $6.4 million. So I'll just give you the year-to-date so you don't have to do the addition there. The full year 2013 consolidated, $410.3 million; Stores Group, $330.9 million; Consumer Group, $47.4 million; Global Finishes, $43.6 million; and Latin America was actually negative $28.8 million.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Just, Sean, on the SG&A question again, in the past, you've always invested in the business and even have been proactive about investing ahead of revenue and I think that was the case in '13 as well. But you've also been able to leverage SG&A versus revenue. So from a relative standpoint, is your expectation of SG&A is going up even -- maybe even talking about it with or without Comex?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think that when we look at the 2013, back to your point, and I'm just looking at this -- 2012, our SG&A was 34.2%. Without Comex this year, we would have shown improvement on that. And next year, we're still going to show -- we'll show improvement on the core SG&A. And I'm trying to look at the metric that I can give you, but no, I think the core SG&A will improve.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "And with Comex, it would be up, in terms of revenue?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "When you take a look at it, yes, it's going to be close to up. It's going to be in that ballpark, it's not -- for the full year.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. And then, Chris, I guess there's probably nothing specific you can share on Comex Mexico, but any update on timing at least, of news flow?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we'd be happy to comment on Comex Mexico, we've continued to work on that. And Sean, maybe you can take the team through that.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We continue to believe -- at the very beginning, I'd like to say, we still believe this is going to be a very good acquisition for the company. We'll continue to work on a process that would allow us to close this acquisition. This process required us signing nondisclosure agreements with outside parties, which limits what we can say, but what we will say is we have an exclusive contract with the Achar family through March 31, 2014. We have crafted our final remedy and are prepared to present to the proper authorities. We have not received a firm date of that presentation but fully expect it to occur in February, with a response from the commission sometime after that but close to the March 31 date.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "And is it your expectation of that decision would then be final one way or another?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "That's why we used the word final remedy. I think that this is our final bite of the apple.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Sean, just a clarification on the tax rate given the Comex U.S. and Canadian distortions, what is the tax rate that you've embedded in your earnings guidance for 2014 or range of tax rates?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. We don't go down -- again, we try not to go down the whole frame, because there some -- we don't have 1 range, we have multiple scenarios to get into a range. But if you take a look at year-to-date without the Comex, it would have been in that 32.3% range. We've all constantly talking about that low 33%s. And I think that you go back the last 5 years, I think it's been in that low 33% type of range.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then second question for Chris, if I may, I heard your comments regarding the California litigation or, I guess, Bob's comments here and the appeals associated with that. How should we be thinking about funding of the $1.15 billion in terms of how it could possibly be split among the defendants and timing? And separate question, do you have any other avenues of recourse beyond the appeals process factoring property owners, for example?", "Robert J. Wells", "Kevin, it's Bob. On the first part of the question, the decision by the judge, the remedy is joint and several -- is a joint and several liability. So it means that all 3 defendants are essentially equally responsible for the entire remedy. He has given no indication how he intends to apportion the remedy across 3 defendants. It's also our position that it's kind of a moot issue at this stage in the game because we don't believe we'll have to pay any money prior to the appeal process. This is a mandatory injunction, which we do not believe should require any appeal bond or anything of that nature. As far as future actions with respect to factoring homeowners or anything like that, we're not prepared to go into that at this point.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "It looks like incremental margins in your Paint Stores Group declined pretty sharply on a sequential basis and year-over-year when you remove Comex. Is there any seasonality in this or is there something unique, just trying to get more color on what drove the decline in incremental margins.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I don't know what number you're using for Comex margins but even with that, the fourth quarter is always interesting because of LIFO, the physical inventory adjustments that we spoke about before, so a couple of years ago, we were talking about this. 2009, our gross margin actually was 48.5% in the quarter because of some of these things that have occurred. So there's different things that go on between 1 fourth quarter to another. Fourth quarter is the toughest to look at. I think to try to read, to try to project anything in the future.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Got it. And just as a follow-up, I think at one time, estimates, the Sherwin's estimate, at least, for total gallons in the U.S. was somewhere in the line of 630 million to 640 million in 2012. Do you have an estimate or do you have an update for what you think it may have been in 2013?", "Robert J. Wells", "Nils, this is Bob. We think the market in 2013 probably grew in the 4% to 5%, maybe 5.5% range. And we base that just by looking at various public statements and public releases across the population of publicly traded companies that do significant architectural business in the U.S.. That feels about right to us.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Could you give us a timeframe for getting the U.S. and Canada Comex stores to the average Sherwin-Williams margins? And given the potential here that you might have to divest the wholly-owned Mexican Sherwin-Williams operations, I don't know, whether the nondisclosure will allow you to at least range that -- or size it for us? And is it above or below the average paint store margins?", "Robert J. Wells", "Just so you know, first, Mexico stores that you're referred to, our operations are in the LACG segment, they're not in the store segment. Just want to make sure that's clear. On the first question of what we've said is, again, that $0.60 to $0.65, and what we've said is in 2015, in the annual 2015, we think that the Comex stores will run at the 70% to 80% of where Paint Stores Group is at. And then after that, it will start to continue to improve from there. And the Comex -- and the Mexican assets, we're really, again, we're little -- we're under secrecy with the nondisclosure, we really don't want to express what the remedy may or may not be and then also not going to give metrics to any possible remedy. I think what's better course for us is that if we get approval, we'll disclose all of those type of things to you. And if we don't get approval, we probably won't, that's for sure. The remedy will never be public.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Two quick points or questions. On the $0.45 to $0.55 hit that you expect in 2014 from Comex, in that, can you give us some color as to how much of that is going to be onetime or kind of structurally working to fit the asset in versus kind of just the normal run rate for that business?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, I think that 60% will be onetime hits and it will be in that range.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. So that business is then running at a loss kind of -- or in your mind, for 2014, is going to run at a loss the whole year?", "Robert J. Wells", "Right. Because what happens is, when you -- let's say, you're going to -- you're living in the short term with the additional cost of, possibly, some plants and distribution centers, those were considering part, until we close them and taking the hit, we consider that part of the ongoing op. And that's where you start saying, which bucket do you put it in. But if you close the plant in September, at the end of September, then the first 9 months go into your first bucket of the operating margin and then the hit of closing plant goes into the extraordinary. That answer would tell you that if we run that plant for 9 months, that's in the normal, not in the extraordinary.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, okay. Fair enough. And just then just one follow-up question. If we back out Comex in terms of kind of what it did in the fourth quarter and then also kind of how it's going to impact 2014, it looks like you're guiding to 5% to 10% top line growth, which normally, based on kind of what Chris had talked about earlier in terms of leverage, tax, what have you, should get you $1.25 to almost $2.25 of incremental EPS and that -- but your guidance really doesn't imply that when you kind of look at your core non-Comex-related business, it looks like it's at the very low-end or even sub that. So, I guess, what's driving that, what's driving that level of conservatism in your kind of core platform?", "Robert J. Wells", "I will tell you this. I would just say, if you take a look at the core, I don't think that a 5% gain has ever given us $2.25 EPS growth in a year. And so when you look at the number that Chris gave you, the $7.60 versus the $6.49, it's $1.11. And so when you sit there and look at that $7.60, and I'm just going to add back the midpoint, that's is -- use the midpoint, $8.22 and $0.50 of Comex, that takes you up to $8.72 from $7.60, that's $1.12 when you take a look at that, so I think that's pretty comparable. And I do think that, in general, I think that things are going pretty well. I think $1.11 on top of $1.12 last year, $1.12 versus $1.11 are pretty comparable. And when you look at that sales gain, just like this year, we think that currency is still going to be a headwind and some of these countries are still going to have some problems.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with Keybanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions are answered. I just have a quick one. In the Global Group, continuing to be fairly -- consolidation continues to move on. Is there any opportunity for you to consolidate that market further? And then if you look at your European businesses, I know that they're small, relative, but have you seen any stabilization to improvement going forward?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Ivan, we have talked for a while with The Street about our strategy here. We like these businesses. We would look for opportunities to invest appropriately were there opportunities to present themselves, we won't comment on any of that, perspectively. Europe had a good year for our Global Finishes business. We're seeing some nice progress over there from the teams that we've put on the ground. We expect Europe to continue to have profitable sales going forward.", "Robert J. Wells", "And on your first question, our operating profit in 2012 was 7.5%. This year, it was 8.5%. So nice 1% gain on the ROF. And as we've talked in the past, we still think we can drive that to 12%, so we think there's still big improvement in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "A couple of questions. First of all, to follow-up on the last question. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in your Global Group businesses in terms of auto collision and industrial markets. You mentioned that Europe was strong for your wood coatings business, but can you talk about the other portions of Global?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, so I think all 3 of these businesses ran pretty much at the same level. You can see that the sales results here were below the company's consolidated numbers. So a relatively soft sales year. We've commented about soft economic environment, some of the end markets that we sell products into are a little soft as well. I think that when we take the market performance itself into consideration, not concerned that we're losing share here, but not exactly lighting it up either. Going forward, we're pretty excited about the winter we're having across the United States. Automotive runs on collision repair business and so that should be a little bit of a tailwind for that team going into this year and I think we've had some nice wins on various accounts around the world in our product finishes businesses. We'd expect them to have a little better year going forward next year as well. So beyond that, Dmitry, not a lot more to comment on.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. If you look at the Consumer Group, it really had a nice turnaround as the year progressed. It sort of started the year weakly and you have some losses of a business, and then it seemed to well turned around by the end of the year. Can you talk a little bit about sort of what you guys done to get that ship moving in the right direction and also what's your outlook for the consumer is for 2014 both in terms of, not maybe the top line, directionally and perhaps margin expectations.", "Christopher M. Connor", "So I'll take the business and the sales, and we'll Sean comment on margin expectations for Consumer Group. You're right, the fourth quarter was terrific. One of the best quarters we've seen in sometime. And it was pretty broad-based across the entire customer segment. The product lines, as you know, in our consumer business, we have architectural paint, but we also have aerosols and brushes and rollers, caulks and sealants, stains, water protecting products and pretty much, across the board, all those business were going in a good direction. I don't think that the fourth quarter is the precursor of things to come. We've been consistent with our guidance that this is a low single-digit kind of growing business for the company, I don't think we're expecting that we've reached a new kind of a plateau, we're going to run at this level going forward. But it was encouraging to see and I think one of our executives made a comment that when we get good quarters in consumer, we'll take them, we're glad for them. Our expectations are that most of the headwinds that we've had here that have been kind of event driven, lost the big accounts, et cetera, have all anniversary-ed, they're all behind us. So 2014, knock on wood, might be one of those years that's a pretty normalized year and give us a sense of how the business can actually run. Sean, you want to comment a little bit on our margin expectations here?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure. Over the years, we've continued to talk about that consumer can have -- their operating margins can be higher than stores, but it's going to be more volatile. And so when we get volume through and what's nice is there was volumes, for the last couple of years, we've had volume only going through from the stores group, as Chris talked about, the struggles on the external sales. But when you get external sales like we have, as well as the internal sales going through there, consumer can really produce nicely for us. And that's why we've always thought that the margins can be higher there, but because of the choppiness of demand, especially on the external side, you're going to see it much more volatile. So last year, we hit 18%, I think that it's a well-managed division that we've given some assets from the Comex grouping to them. I think that they'll do a great job with those assets and I think that in the end, you'll see margins higher than this. I can't remember when stores groups' highest margin was 14.4%. And someone said, \"Well, are you ever going to beat that?\" We've beat it a few times now, the last 2 years actually. And I think our Consumer Group, we expect to go higher with some of these assets and add a little more volume.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got it. And just a couple of bookkeeping questions. What's your CapEx and G&A expectations for 2014?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think our CapEx is going to be somewhere in the $180 million to $200 million range. And as we bring in some -- do some of these work and move some production around. And our G&A should be in the $35 million range, up from around $29 million to $30 million they had this year. And use those numbers, they're not going to be materially off.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Bob, I wanted to follow-up on your growth outlook for U.S. architecture. You talked about 5%, 5.5% growth in calendar '13, with the pickup in commercial or nonresidential construction this year. Would you expect that to accelerate? And then the follow-on to that is Paint Stores grew at almost 8% versus 5% market growth and, obviously, nonres is even higher proportion of contractor business, so would you expect your Paint Stores Group sales to -- on a same-store sales basis, to outpace the market growth even further in 2014?", "Robert J. Wells", "Don, on the first part of the question, if the rate of housing starts holds up and that would be a 10% to 15% increase year-over-year in the rate of housing starts, and we see this high single digit acceleration in nonresidential starts, with a commensurate amount of nonresidential maintenance and -- property maintenance activity, it would be very easily -- easy to duplicate mid single-digit industry growth rate in 2014. We have long said that our expectation for our Paint Stores Group is for growth in the range of 1.5x to 2x market rate. And we think, in that environment, that's probably doable as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Gregg Melich with ISI Group.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "The half of the $40 million of loss that you had in the quarter from the acquisitions, the half that was impairment, did that show up in the gross margin or SG&A?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would tell you probably 65%, 70% went in to gross margin and the remainder went to SG&A.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then the second question was on the pricing. I recognized it's difficult given Comex having a different mix. But if you could just look at the old Paint Stores Group, what do you think the pricing is?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, I think, that again, because as time goes on, there's customers that are going to go from the old to the new, the Comex stores. And I think that any metric we give you might give you a wrong indication, Greg. And that's what we're trying to walk away from this, this quarter. We might -- a year from now, we might come back to the old way but right now, we're -- with people going from 1 store to another, it's -- any metric might give you the wrong indication.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I understand. But so to maybe to get to the -- another angle about gross margin, it looks like gross margins, if you back out the DOJ settlement, where, really, you only have 20 or 30 bps. I guess, why did the GM gains decelerate so much in the fourth quarter? Is there something else that going on that we need to be...", "Robert J. Wells", "No. I think that -- I think it was the Comex. If you take a look at that piece that went through, that onetime hit that went through gross margins that we just -- I just gave you, I think should give you a pretty good idea that, really, gross margins didn't decelerate.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's the 65%.", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Start it off with Sean, I think around the time you announced the Comex acquisition, I had asked about using the financing that you had instituted for repo if the deal didn't get done, is that still your feeling?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. But you can probably tell that we're close to having a final answer in this, so we still have that cash on our balance sheet. But if not, we'll end up buying back stock.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. And then that 36% incremental margin, I don't understand quite how you got to that. But I do see if I back out the Comex impact on the paint stores in the quarter, the segment got about a 16.6% margin, can you sort of connect the dots there, Sean, between those 2 figures?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Chuck, do you have one other question, I'll pull out that piece of paper.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "All right. And then the other question would be if you look at the approximately $20 million hit from Comex in the fourth quarter due to onetime items and once your forecasting for Comex's hit in the first quarter, it looks like you're going to be spending more on onetime items, perhaps. And that the operations should already be showing improvement in the fourth -- in the first quarter of 2014, is that a correct conclusion to draw?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Again, that's why we put a little bit wider range on here, it really depends on when we take some of these closing costs, Chuck. But the first quarter should be fairly consistent with the -- the first quarter should be fairly consistent. But yes, you're right, when you back that out, it's going to be slightly better than the fourth quarter with the 50-50.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. Have you announced any -- I think you've closed a couple of plants and a distribution center on Comex. Have you announced any other facility shutdowns or integrations with existing Sherwin operations?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We've announced 4 closings, Chuck, to date, of the 8 that we had talked about that we acquired. And not all of those are down or cost into the numbers yet but 4 have been announced.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "So, Chuck, back to your other question, if you take a look at the operating profit in the store group segment, $990 million. You add back the $43 million that we talked about, the acquisition impact, without that, it would have been 1-0-3 -- call it 1-0-3-3. You compare that, that means that the PBT change is $171,000,855. The sales without the Comex was up $476 million, $171 million divided by $476 million, 36.1%.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland research.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "Two things, first of all, Sean, you referenced, just curious, was there a LIFO charge that was material that impacted the 4Q Paint Stores profit?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, but I think what happens is that when you start -- just look at the fourth quarter, it might not be material. But if you look at the change year-over-year, because 1 year might be a hit, 1 year might be a credit. And those -- we true that up in the fourth quarter. So even though LIFO might be a credit for the year, you might have a debit there because of the way you accrued it in the first 3 quarters.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "So was there a material year-over-year change in how that influenced the 4Q number?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I don't have that exact number but I would say -- I was trying to answer the question about why specifically the fourth quarter isn't as pure as the other 3 quarters, so I don't think LIFO is that material between one or the other.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "And then secondly, Comex have owned these stores for a while now, it seemed like they were losing market share and money before you acquired them. Obviously, closing facilities helps on the money side. But in terms of the market share in those stores, how was sales growth performing in those versus the core and how do you feel about the trajectory of market share in that business?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Eric, we've done a lot to stabilize this business since acquiring it. As an example, a number of these stores did not have a full complement of management inside. Sales rep territories were open. Stores were struggling to get inventory when we had acquired them. All of those fixes have been made and made quickly. And we're seeing a stabilization of the existing customer base through these stores. We're every bit optimistic that these things are going to run in line with the other stores inside the districts that they're joining. And so the business is doing fine from that regard and we expect it to get better as time goes on.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.", "Richard O'Reilly", "On the Paint Stores Group margins, if we exclude the loss, the acquisition loss, it looks like the margin, if I did my math right, was about 14.3% or slightly down from a year ago, which is a surprise because of the higher volumes. Can you expand that or was the benefit of the volumes all showing up in the Consumer Group?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "You're talking about the quarter, correct?", "Richard O'Reilly", "For the quarter, yes.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think when you look at it, without the acquisitions, just from the quarter, like we did with Chuck, you add the $40 million back, you're at $208 million, that would tell you that we were at 12.3% and last year we're at 14.6%. And I would just say it had to do with how some SG&A rolled in. I think when you look at the Stores Group, especially the way new stores rolled in, a little more heavy in the fourth quarter than it was in 2012.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay, fine. Timing of course. Okay. And the volume gain, the Consumer Group has benefited from the volume gains in the paint business, that's part of it, right?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, yes.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay, fine. Okay. Second question on your inflation outlook. A year ago, you said it was also going to be up low-single digit, what did it work out to be for calendar '13, do you have an idea?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Richard, we think it's pretty stable, year-over-year. And TiO2 was down a little and the rest of the basket was up slightly.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay, fine. So a year ago, you are too pessimistic and now you're looking at the things about the same way. Okay, fine.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on the gross profit, guys. On the Lat Am segment, did you say that the profit was $6.4 million increase or decrease?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And I will tell you that in 10 seconds here. I've got to double check, because they way you asked the question.", "Charles A. Dan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I didn't mean it to sound like an accusation.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, it was a decrease.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue at this time. I would now like to hand the floor back over to management for any concluding comments.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, again, Jesse. Let me conclude this morning by asking you all to save the date of Thursday, May 22nd, on your calendars. This is the date we'll host our annual financial community presentation at the Intercontinental Barclays Hotel in New York City. The program, as usual, will consist of our customary morning presentations with questions and answers followed by a reception and lunch. Again, the date is Thursday, May 22nd, and we'll be sending out invitations and related information in the weeks ahead.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Tyler Treat, Treasurer and Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Tyler Treat", "Good morning and welcome to our Fiscal 2014 first quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today who will provide insight on our business and the first quarter results we announced this morning. Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Muehlbauer, Valspar's Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valsparglobal.com.", "And, finally, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report on our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news volume.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Hendrickson.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Thank you, Tyler, and good morning everyone. We are pleased with our overall performance in the first quarter with total sales growth of 9% and a 17% increase in EPS. These results build on the momentum from last quarter and are consistent with our growth agenda for fiscal 2014. Our plans for this year assumed improved stability in some of our key end markets, continued growth for new business, benefit from the Inver acquisition, and efficiencies from productivity initiatives.", "Early into the year, we are tracking well against each of these drivers and I will talk about several highlights from each of our reporting segments. In our paint segment, we continue to see the benefits from an improving U.S. housing market. First quarter sales increased double digits in our U.S. consumer paint business, driven by growth in both the home improvement and independent hardware store channel. Part of this growth is our Professional Paint program at Lowe's. This program significantly enhances our ability to serve the large, professional paint market. We remain very positive on this programs and its growth potential.", "Another part of our growth is Ace Hardware. We have been manufacturing all of their private label paints for the past year and in Q4 of last year we also began shipping Valspar branded paints to Ace. The combination of private label and branded paint sales to Ace in the first quarter is one of the key drivers of our total growth in the paint segment. We continue to expect to have over 3000 stores redesigned and reset before the summer painting season. ", "Our international paint businesses also had a good first quarter. We saw continuing progress in Australia, where the housing market has shown some stability with an increase in new housing approvals, and we have gained market share in both the trade and resale channel. Our first quarter paint sales in Australia were up by mid-single digits in local currency, which is a significant improvement over the declines experience last year. Additionally, we had a good quarter in consumer paint in China. We continued to expand the product range and distribution of our products serving the large, affordable housing market and benefitted from a relatively easy comparison due to the softness experienced in the first quarter last year.", "Moving now to our coatings segment. A number of our key product lines marked volume and share gains in the quarter through new business wins. Let me highlight a few. We continued to benefit from new business growth and increased volume in our packaging product line, where we secured new volume with key customers in both the U.S. and Europe. Our wood product line also continues to perform well, benefitting from new business in addition to the U.S. housing market improvement. The general industrial markets that we serve remain soft. However, we saw sequential improvement in our general industrial product lines sales with particular strength in the China off-road and construction equipment market. We are encouraged by this performance but continue to expect these end markets to remain uneven as we move through the year.", "The other large growth driver in the quarter was the acquisition of Inver, which continues to progress nicely. Inver strengthens our presence in Europe and provides a proven distribution model that we can leverage in this important market. We are pleased by Inver's performance and our integration activities remain on plan.", "And finally, our restructuring and productivity initiatives are generating the efficiency in savings we planned for in our global operations. In summary, we are off to a good start but it's early in the year. We continue to expect annual EPS in the range of $3.95 to $4.15.", "And with that, I will turn it over to Jim who will provide some additional context on the quarter.", "James Muehlbauer", "Thank you, Gary, and good morning everyone. I would like to provide you with an overview of the key drivers behind our performance in the first quarter and some context on our expectations for the year.", "Overall sales growth quarter of 9% was led by volume gains in both our coatings and paint segment driven by acquisitions and new business wins. Looking specifically at the paint segment. Sales increased 10%. We saw double-digit sales growth in North America consumer paints. This growth included benefits from the rollout of Valspar branded products at Ace, and growth from our expanded Professional Paint program with Lowe's.", "We also saw growth in our international markets. Improvements in China were driven by the expanded distribution of products targeted at the affordable housing sector, which continues to represent a large opportunity for us in this market. Paint sales in China in the quarter also benefited from a weak comparison period in the first quarter of last year and sales decline. In Australia, we saw sales increase in mid-single digits in local currency, demonstrating further progress in this market. Our team in Australia has worked to position the business for long-term improvement and the benefit of that work is now becoming more visible in our results, with share gains in both the retail and trade.", "Before I move on to discuss sales in the coatings segment, I wanted to remind you that we will anniversary both the acquisition of the Ace private label business, and the launch of the expanded Lowe's Pro program starting in the second quarter of this year. Now that these items will be included in our base, the sales growth rates in paint will be lower in the balance of the year. This is consistent with our plan.", "In the coatings segment sales also increased 10%, driven primarily by the Inver acquisition. We saw another quarter of high single-digit volume growth in our packaging product line from new business wins in the U.S. and Europe. Our wood business also had another good quarter, benefiting from the combination of new business wins and continuing improvements in the housing market. Sales in the general industrial product line are still challenged and were down mid-single digits in the first quarter, excluding acquisitions. We did see some sequential improvement from Q4 of last year, in part driven by new business wins and increase customer build in the off-road market in China. As you recall, last year several of the general industrial product lines experienced end market weakness and in some cases large customer inventory reduction. It's good to see some sequential improvement in the first quarter but it's early in the year. We continue to expect uneven demand in these end markets.", "Let's move to discuss several other financial highlights. The first quarter gross margin rate of 34% increased approximately 40 basis points over last year. This increase was driven by improved sales mix, better price cost in China, and benefit from leveraging higher overall sales volumes. SG&A expense in the quarter was 22.8% of sales, reflecting approximately 15 basis points improvement over the prior year. The rate improvement reflects the leverage benefit of higher sales. SG&A spending increased 8.5% in the first quarter, reflecting the addition of Inver, investments related to growth initiatives, and slightly higher FX.", "Bringing it all together, total operating income increased 15% and operating margins expanded 50 basis points to 11.2%. From a segment perspective, EBIT margins in paints increased 250 basis points to 9.4%. This growth was primarily the result of benefits from much higher sales volumes and improved profitability in China and Australia. In addition, we are also comparing against a soft Q1 last year, when segment EBIT margins declined 120 basis points. Looking forward, we do not expect paint segment sales to grow at the rate experienced in the first quarter, given the annualization of the new business wins I discussed earlier. In addition, as we move into the painting season, we will increase spending to support key growth initiatives and retail programs. As a result, we do not expect the same level of year-over-year expansion in our paint segment EBIT margins as experienced in the first quarter.", "In the coatings segment, EBIT dollars were up 6% over the previous year and margins declined 60 basis points to 14.3%. The decline in rate continues to be primarily the result of the Inver acquisition. Wrapping up the highlights from the quarter, we continue to focus on improving shareholder returns and repurchased approximately 975,000 shares of the company stock for a total investment of approximately $69 million.", "In closing, our fiscal 2014 plans called for improved sales and operating performance driven by the benefits of the Inver acquisition, new business initiatives and improved stability in customer demand in several of our key end markets and geographies. As we enter the second quarter, our overall outlook and guidance for the year remains unchanged.", "With that, we would like to thank you for your interest in Valspar and open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) First we will go to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Since you don\u2019t provide quarterly guidance, can you just give us a view as to whether 1Q was better than your own internal expectations, and if it was better, what are one of the two drivers that drove the upside in your view?", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes. Essentially Q1 came in very close to what we anticipated. Certainly as we go through the balance of the year, we will focus on delivering our annual results. But sales and margins in each of the segments were very consistent with what we anticipated in the first quarter.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. That\u2019s great context. Thank you. And then can you just take us through, region by region across your paint business. You seem to be recovering in Australia and China but can you just broadly tough on the momentum you are seeing in those markets. And on the U.S. on an organic basis, what do you estimate the market grew excluding some of the growth initiative impacts. Thanks.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes, Ghansham, it's Gary. Second part of your question first, I don\u2019t know what the market growth was. I would guess, probably low single-digits, something like that in our quarter. But we don\u2019t get that data until a couple of months, two or three months from now. But our business was driven mainly by new business wins in the quarter. And kind of reiterating some of the points that Jim and I made in our opening comments. I mean we had a good quarter in every region of the world this quarter. Top line growth at 10% was in line with our expectations. We expected the business in China to recover in the quarter. We knew that our Australia business was getting better.", "Margin expansion, as Jim explained, was also expected. We said in our opening remarks, we had a soft Q1 last year. Particularly in China because of the way our distributors ordering patterns looked in fiscal '12. So about half of that improvement in margin was expected and I would call that more or less a return to normal. The rest of it was a combination of mix improvement, leverage on higher volumes, Australia performed better and we see raw material cost in China lower today than they were last year because the market generally is weak, the overall market. So our international business is, again, Australia had positive volume and positive sales in local currency.", "We are seeing some signs of stability in the housing market. I would say the team there thinks it has stabilized. You know housing approvals were up pretty substantially. Next six months or so after that we start to see the builds occur. But just as importantly for us, we are seeing now the benefits of the restructuring activities that we have been engaged in over the last couple of years and the commercial initiatives. You know we are confident that for the second quarter in a row, we took share in both the retail channel and in the trade channel.", "China was good. As Jim said, we continue to expand the product line and distribution of our affordable housing products, that was a good benefit in the quarter. We got leverage on volume and as I said, raw material costs were under control. And in U.S. we had a good quarter as well, particularly with the increased volumes that we are experiencing due to the roll out of Valspar products at Ace. As I mentioned in my opening remarks that Ace program was going really well. We have something like 1500 stores redesigned and reset at this point in time, and we are on track to have over 3000 Ace stores set with the Valspar program before the summer painting season. So I would call it a quarter where all of our paint businesses regionally were firing on most cylinders.", "Operator", "Next we will go the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "A couple of questions and just a quick follow-up to Ace. So Ace, that you are in 1500 stores, is that 1500 stores that you have the Valspar product in and you expect to be in 3000 or is that just the redesign or your marketing initiative is in all 1500 stores? Just to clarify.", "Gary Hendrickson", "1500 stores are reset with the new Valspar racks, painting [ph] machines etcetera, and there is Valspar paint in the store. So there will be 3000 stores plus, by the start of the painting season they will have Valspar paint on their shelves, Ivan.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great. And then if you look at the consumer business, how much did new business ex Ace, contribute to the results on the top line?", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes. So we are still anniversaring the rollout of Lowe's Pro from last spring. This is the last quarter where we are going to see the benefits of having that in the portfolio. We will start to lap that in earnest in Q2. So that was the other big part in addition to Ace. Really the two drivers from a new business standpoint in the quarter in the U.S. consumer business were the Valspar branded products at Ace and Lowe's Pro. So we saw core growth in the core business with our private label paint at Ace and with Lowe's, but the big drivers were just the initial volumes from Lowe's Pro and Valspar branded products.", "Gary Hendrickson", "And I would like to add to that, Jim, for the international businesses, Ivan, we went from negative volumes in sales in Q4 last year in Australia, slightly negative, very slightly negative, to positive mid-single digits and that\u2019s a reasonably sizable business. And our China business had a very quarter. So international businesses contributed significantly to the results in the quarter, both top and bottom line.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Is profitability in Australia near double-digits?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Let's just say, it's much improved over the next year, we are not at our target yet.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great. And then you have mentioned raw materials being favorable, how much did that help the quarter? Were raw materials cost down or up or...?", "Gary Hendrickson", "It was really only in China. I said it was China only. Our overall raw material basket through the company was more or less flat.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great. And then my last question and I will get back in. Speaking of new business, the container opportunity that you announced, I believe in late November, early December. How do you see that opportunity unfolding for you and where do you think the potential is for container growth like you have the next year or two?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Sure. Well, first of all the container market is still worse than anemic. You pick a word worse than anemic and that\u2019s what the container looks. So there aren't many containers being built today. But our partnership is with Maersk, which is the largest shipping company in the world. Maersk makes some of their own containers and then they buy containers from other shipping companies. They are building a factory in South China. We are participating in that as a partner and will be the exclusive supplier to that Maersk factory. When that factory is up and running, sales to that factory will be in excess of $20 million a year. But more importantly, Ivan, what we are trying to do is we are trying to change the shipping container industry in terms of switching from highly polluting, expensive, dangerous solvent based products to our water-based product. Maersk is a leader in the shipping industry and a leader in the container industry and a reference customer. We think that this is an enabler of our strategy to convert that market.", "Ivan Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great. In terms of sales where do you think right now -- I know, right now it's terrible, but if you look out three, four, five years, where do you think the ultimate potential of that market is?", "Gary Hendrickson", "So it swings wildly. I mean, there was -- a few years ago, we think there was almost $1 billion worth of container coatings sold. Last year, we think there was around $100 million or $150 million sold. So we went into the container business with our eyes wide open. We know now that it's a very cyclical market and so I know that makes it difficult for planning and your modeling but it's no less difficult than it is for us.", "Operator", "Next we will go the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Gary, just curious, you know that there had been some rays of hope in industrial but you are still going to be pretty cautious, I think as you put it, uneven expectations or expectation for the market to be uneven. Would you say that\u2019s a different course than you had going into '13 where maybe you, if I recall, you guys sort of expected an improvement as you went through the year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Right. I guess you could say we learned our lesson from '13, Bob, in terms of trying to predict. And prediction for us is conversations with our customers about markets that are uncertain. And so we are being cautious this year. The other thing that is different this year, about last year, is this horrible weather that we see. And I think it may have had a modest impact on both our paint, in current paint sales, and some of our industrial sales in the quarter. So we are being cautious. As an example, in our pipe business. We think some projects were delayed because the weather is so cold. In our coil coatings business, we know that we didn\u2019t make some shipments to customers because they weren't producing because of the cold weather.", "So in addition to macro factors, we are also kind of factoring in the weather this year and trying to understand what that\u2019s going to mean for our industrial businesses. So we had a great '12, we had a '13 that we weren't happy with. '14, we are a little bit more optimistic but we are also being cautious.", "Robert Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And maybe along similar lines, I noticed last quarter for the first time you guys released some revenue guidance. I didn\u2019t see an update for the annual revenue guidance this year, but it would strike me that may be that 7% to 9% could still be cautious given that we have seen some price hikes in the retail sector and Cat and Deere talk about some improvement in the off-roads markets in '14. So any shot you could give us, like a recalibration on that 7% to 9% revenue growth for this year.", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes, Bob, I tried to cover that as I kind of went through kind of a broader statement on our outlook. Really, we are not thinking about the top line any differently than we were at the beginning of the year. We put that range out there for the first time just given the nature of the significant new business that we had won last year and what we expect to do this year. So we hope that that\u2019s a helpful view for shareholders to look at as they think about our performance for the year. But sitting here at the end of the first quarter there is a wide range of outcomes, but fundamentally we don\u2019t feel different about that range than we did at the beginning of the year.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital", "I was wondering, you talked a lot about new business and some about volumes. Could you touch on the different end markets and what you are seeing around pricing and what your expectations might be for pricing for this year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Pricing, Duffy, would -- I would say that it will be consistent with what our expectation for inflation are. And we said, our expectation for inflation, I think we said are low mid-single digits, which wouldn\u2019t imply too much pricing. I will say that in some places where we have had inflation in different parts of our raw material basket, we are working with customers on moving pricing through the supply chain. But by and large, it's not a big factor in our thinking for the year.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then I assume it has something to do with the acquisitions, maybe some inventory step up. But inventory was up about 18% year-over-year, meaningfully more than sales. Could you walk through what the large jump in inventory was?", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes, Duffy, it's Jim. Primarily it was driven by, you are absolutely right, the acquisition of Ace. That was the biggest driver of inventory, but also the inventory--", "Gary Hendrickson", "Inver.", "James Muehlbauer", "I am sorry, Inver, the acquisition of Inver. Also the other elements that are driving the inventory increase would be just the build out of the Ace branded product and getting ready for the B&Q launch that we talked about.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then just the last one for me. Can you kind of update your thinking on B&Q? How the timing for that looks? And as we start looking for ads and stuff like that around the U.K., what we should expect to see?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, you'll start to see some advertising as we move into the selling season, late spring. We have got 100 stores set. It's kind of going in three phases. They have three store formats, Duffy, and we believe they got one store format just about completed. They are starting on the next one. And all of those 350 stores, we expect that things stay in schedule. We expect to have them all set by the end of the summer, early fall.", "Operator", "Next we go to the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Congratulations on a nice start to the year. Can you guys talk a little bit more about the sales and the profit impact of Inver, now that you had it for the second quarter. And sort of what's your outlook for that business is, given that it's a European centric business.", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes, Dmitry, it's Jim. If you recall, when we announced the Inver acquisition, we talked about an impact of roughly $0.10 for a year, comprised not only of the addition of the sales but also reflecting the benefits of some restructuring and synergy opportunities we have between the Inver business and our European operations. So as Gary mentioned in his comments, that integration process continues to go very well. The business has been performing in line to just slightly better than expectations since we owned it. So we are encouraged by the continuing top line progress in that business. It does trade at a lower EBIT multiple than our core businesses, which is why we are calling out kind of the overall dilution in our segment margins. But so far for the year, it's performing on plan and we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities we see to grow in that important market place for us.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay, thanks. If you look at the, particularly the North American paint market where you have gotten double-digit growth in the quarter, could you strip out the Ace and the Lowe's impact in the sort of, look at the same-store basis. How did that business do for you and was their much of a weather impact for January or perhaps in December and what's your outlook for February and March of this year on same store, if you sort of get the....?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. I would say, this is the lowest. Whenever you try to call out POS in December, January, February, Dmitry, it's kind of a gap. It's not as predictable as we do it in the spring and summer season. So I think probably, low mid-single digits across our distribution, would be an answer to your question. But we don\u2019t have perfect visibility on all that data either.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Fair enough. You mentioned getting some market share wins or customer wins in packaging space. The food can market has gone through material destocking at least by the people that actually make the cans, and particularly in Europe. Was that much of an impact in your business or is that still to be seen or sort of how do you think about the packaging business going forward. Obviously you are gaining share, so you can do better than the market, but what are you looking at the market itself.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, I think it's pretty well known to people that follow the packaging market that the U.S. market has contracted a little bit over the last couple of years. And that\u2019s not a surprise to anyone who follows it. And the beverage, the beverage market however is growing in the Middle East, in Europe and Latin America, and in Asia, quite substantially. That\u2019s where a lot of our market share wins have taken place over the last 12 months or so. And so, yes, we are probably growing through those wins three times the rate of the market growth in beverage.", "In food, in Europe we took a pretty significant amount of share last year and while the, I think the market was down a little bit, our business was up mid-single digits in Europe. You know that we have a very strong position in North America food and so the impact that you described in terms of the customer destocking and a weak pack had an impact on our results in the quarter. So we are bullish on the packaging business in the long-term. It's a growth market globally. We are the leader, we are the technology leader. We are the leader in non-BPA technology which was the source of some of the share gains that we had in Europe food. So we wish it were growing faster but we are at a very nice position there.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Very good, Gary. And then one final question. Just sort of returning to your comment about anniversaring the Valspar pickup at Lowe's as well as the Ace Hardware house paint. And it's like a poor growth in the balance of the year from the paint segment. You still have B&Q stores to ramp up in terms of sales in the second half of the year. It sounds like an obviously Valspar branded paint at Ace is still sort of on the comp, in terms of year-over-year comps. So even though your growth is going to probably slow down versus the channel fill that you referred to earlier, you should still -- I should ask this as a question, remember this is like jeopardy. Do you still see a little bit sort of faster than market growth in your paint segment just from some of these initiatives continuing and ramping up in B&Q and Valspar at Ace?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I will say that -- so I will answer the question this way -- I will be disappointed if the Valspar brand doesn\u2019t grow faster than the market this year. Our expectation is that Valspar is going to grow faster than the market this year.", "Operator", "Next we will go the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna", "Yes, I want to follow up on second half profit growth and specifically the Ace program. You had mentioned that you just thought that the rate of EBIT growth would slow as the year goes on, but I would think that as Valspar becomes a bigger part of your mix at Ace, and that\u2019s where most of the profit is, that at least with the Ace program the profitability should pickup as the year goes on.", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes, it's Jim. That\u2019s absolutely true. What I was commenting on was the run rate that we expect in the balance of the year in the paint segment is not expected to stay at the 250 basis point EBIT improvement expansion that we saw in Q1. So I know most people weren't thinking that at the beginning of the year. Certainly our plans don't reflect that. We will see a continued improvement in the EBIT margins from our business in paint for the reasons you mentioned but as I also mentioned in my comments, as we move in the painting season, we are supporting that new business growth with investments to support the brand and to support our retail partners as we do the launches at Ace, and as we continue to build the business with Lowe's together.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna", "And to follow up on Lowe's Pro. You mentioned you will be anniversaring that program next quarter, sometime in the second quarter. What's the actual organic growth potential or said another way, what potential do you see for contractors to do business at big boxes as opposed to paint stores. Do you think that\u2019s a significant growth opportunity over time?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We do. As I have said before on these calls, Don, I mean we have got a committed partner and Valspar is very committed to their professional market. And I think that channel can support a significant with the professional, not every professional. And so if we segment the paint market into the various types of painters that are out there, there are some that that channel probably can't support but there is a very large portion of professional paint market that they can, with the right approach and the right partnership.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna", "Okay. And a final question on productivity. You refer to lots of productivity, are you still referring mainly to your North American manufacturing restructuring or is it also kind of encompassing the operating leverage you are getting because of these growth programs and better volumes?", "James Muehlbauer", "It was more focused on the operating leverage in growth programs right now. We will see continued improvements from our restructuring activities but those will scale as we get to the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Next we will go the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi.", "PJ Juvekar - Citi", "Just on coatings side, Gary, can you discuss your wood coatings business, particularly in China? I know that market went through a big downturn. Where are you on that market?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We are doing great in wood coatings in China. That business last year, PJ, was the one industrial business in our mix that had a really good year in China. We have got a great team, number one. People that have been involved in that business for over ten years, great stability in that team. A couple of years ago we integrated our warranty [ph] and the legacy Valspar team, I guess it was probably three years ago, under one leadership structure. So now we have got a team of people that can do business across the whole gamut of manufacturing companies in wood product lines. From the OEMs, the big ones that are doing contract work for U.S. furniture companies, to the small distributors in China, we have got the whole market covered. So we saw a nice growth, mid-single digit growth, and faster than mid-single digit growth in profitability. So we are pleased with that business. You are right, it's been a tough market, but we have been winning share and growing.", "PJ Juvekar - Citi", "Good, thank you. And you talked about this big channel fill at Ace and then you have your Valspar paint being sold there, you have the B&Q rollout. If you just bracket these two things together, B&Q and Ace, what could be the EPS impact from those two? Thank you.", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes, as we said earlier, PJ, we are not expecting a big impact on EPS from B&Q. That\u2019s going to remain to be a diluted initiative for this year. And quite honestly as we move into next year, that\u2019s more about proving out our brand and our model and our partnership, working together with B&Q. So we have never envisioned that as being a big driver of EBIT in the business currently. We will see how that business progresses. As we have talked before, as we move into the balance of this year with Ace, we are going to see improved profitability due to the addition of the Valspar branded product for the full year. Also, in the back half of the year we will start to get more synergies from our combined manufacturing efforts that will kind of finish the restructuring activity from the first half of this year. So we haven't called out the numbers specifically for the year but we are looking for that to be an accretive business for us in the balance of the year.", "Gary Hendrickson", "But it's not much. As we said on the last call, PJ, Ace is dilutive in the first half of the year, starts to become accretive as we move through the second half of the year. And as Jim said, B&Q is slightly dilutive for the whole year. And all of that\u2019s built into our guidance.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse.", "Ernie Ortiz - Credit Suisse", "This is Ernie Ortiz filling in for John. You have a decent amount of exposure to the non-residential cycle, I guess the coil and wood coatings section. Can you describe what you are seeing there? And any thoughts into the balance of the year, is there a recovery on the horizon?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes, Ernie, I don\u2019t know that I agree with your premise that we have got a lot of exposure in that market in our paint and wood coatings business. We have a little bit in our coil coating business with prefab housing and things like that. But we expect, it was a pretty good market last year and we expect it to be a pretty good market this year. It has been impacted by the weather, as I mentioned in some of my earlier remarks that some of those projects are not happening on the pace that we expected. So I expect that to flow through but I really don\u2019t have a good read on that market so I can't answer your question with any specifics.", "Ernie Ortiz - Credit Suisse", "Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, just lastly on the Australia front. Should we continue to expect you to outperform the market? And I guess what exactly are the thinkings for the market to grow out for the remainder of the year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think they are calling for the -- the Australian Paint Manufacturers Federation is calling for something like 2% to 3% volume growth in the Australian paint market this year. And we expect that we will outperform that. We did in the first quarter and we think we will see continued improvement in our business as the year goes on, both at trade and retail.", "Operator", "Next we will go the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Gary, first on paint margins, you mentioned some increased spending in Q2. With that increased spending can you still increase margins year-over-year in that segment do you think?", "Gary Hendrickson", "We expect that on a full year basis our margins will improve in the paint segment this year.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Very good. And same thing on coatings. Given the Inver impact, we are still looking at margins down year-over-year in Q2 given the Inver impacts or other impacts?", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes. Inver is going to continue to put pressure on net margins in the coatings segment until we anniversary it in the fourth quarter. We have a part where -- but remember we started booking that in, I think two of the three months in Q4 of last year. So we will see how the balance of the general industrial businesses play out as the quarters move on, but the main benefit will come from the anniversaries during the fourth quarter.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "What were sales in Q1?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Somewhere around, it was around a $200 million business when we bought it. So divide that by four and that\u2019s roughly what they were.", "David Begleiter - Deutsche Bank", "Just last, Gary. How is the M&A market looking right now from your perspective?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I don\u2019t know about the market, David. I mean if you listen to the investment bankers that come around here you would think it was, we are on the cusp of a renaissance. But a lot of the things don\u2019t come to fruition. We think about our opportunities, you know we did to very nice acquisitions last year with Inver and Ace, and we would love to be able to run our business at a pace, something like that a couple of years. And we are in contact with lots of people as I am sure the other paint companies are, and you just can't predict the timing, particularly with the private owners. You can't predict what the timing is if they decide to monetize their business. So I expect that you will continue to see consolidation in our industry. That\u2019s been the trend for 20 years and there is still a lot of paint companies out there that will be owned by others as the years go by.", "Operator", "And our last question will be a follow-up from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "I just wanted to follow up and you actually touched on that in answer to an earlier question. But you are still on target to close the Ace store and one of your -- I mean plant and one of your plants, and consolidate the Ace production by middle of the year. That still is the plan?", "Gary Hendrickson", "All of our restructuring Dmitry, in the U.S., in Australia and in Europe, is right on plan for the year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. And the closure of that of those plants is why you are looking for that step up in profitability and accretion from the Ace program, right?", "James Muehlbauer", "And the continued inclusion of the branded business as a bigger part of our sales base in the balance of the year.", "Operator", "And I guess we have more time for questions. We will go on to the line of Jeff Zekauskas with J. P. Morgan.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J. P. Morgan", "Was your volume growth rate in paints faster than your sales growth rate in the quarter?", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J. P. Morgan", "By how much?", "Gary Hendrickson", "By about 600 points. And that\u2019s a rough number, Jeff. And that\u2019s a function of the fact that we are doing a private label business for Ace, the Lowe's Pro products at a lower price point and the rest of that mix. And the affordable housing market business which is quite a profitable business but has lower average selling prices than the deal than the overall mix that we are in. So that\u2019s the reason you see that. I view that as a good thing.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J. P. Morgan", "In terms of the sales growth, you were up about 10% for the quarter in paints. Is it correct to think that maybe 60% of that was Lowe's and 40% of that was Ace, as a rough order of magnitude? Or Lowe's was 6 and Ace was 3, something like that?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No, no. In our segment, we were up significantly, high double-digit. And how do you say it, we were up a lot in China off of a weak first quarter last year. Over 30%, just to say the number. In Australia, we swung from negative to positive sales, mid-single digits.", "James Muehlbauer", "In local currency.", "Gary Hendrickson", "In local currency, right. And then the balance would be Ace and Lowe's but I would have to think about what the math is on that.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J. P. Morgan", "So what was the largest factor behind the sales growth of all of the different things you named?", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes, really two things. The continued rollout of the branded programs at Ace. It's the addition of the Lowe's Pro business, and it's the activity that Gary mentioned in China with the volume growth and the affordable housing market, were the three big drivers from a paint standpoint.", "Jeffrey Zekauskas - J. P. Morgan", "And then, lastly, if you look at your titanium dioxide consumption and you compare it to your volume growth in paints, was it more or less the same or did it grow at a faster rate or a slower rate?", "Gary Hendrickson", "If you are question, Jeff, is about are we continuing to get productivity on TiO2, maybe that\u2019s your question, than the answer is yes. We are using less TiO2 across our business today than we were say a couple of years ago, as I think all paint companies and other consumers of TiO2. I mean this is what actually took place a couple of years ago and into last year to get more productive as the TiO2 pricing went up. So we are using less TiO2 in our formulas today than say we were two years or 2.5 years ago, for sure.", "Operator", "Next we will go the line of Charles Dan with Morgan Stanley.", "Charles Dan - Morgan Stanley", "Just wanted to follow up on Jeff's question a little bit. Since we are coming up on 12 months for some of your growth initiatives, is it possible for you to quantify in sales terms what those growth initiatives have done in the last 12 months in terms of revenue?", "James Muehlbauer", "Which initiatives are you talking about specifically, Charlie?", "Charles Dan - Morgan Stanley", "Valspar Pro at Lowe's, the Ace business and B&Q, which I know is still in very early days.", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes. I think so the B&Q, nominal impact. Obviously, just given its early nature. But if the Lowe's Pro, the addition of that last year had a meaningful impact throughout the year, remember we didn\u2019t start that really until Q2. So that was a nice driver of growth for us last year. Even on a full year basis this year, it's going to be a nice addition as we anniversary it in Q1 but we also expect to continue to build on that success. And then the addition of the Ace business last year obviously from a base of zero with the private label business. Meaningful impact for the total company, coupled this year with the addition of the branded business on top of Ace. So a lot of the growth on an annualized basis this year is coming from the initiatives with Ace and the initiatives with Lowe's Pro. A nice element on top of that is that we continue to see benefits from the recovering housing market in our core business as well. So I highlight those big drivers but underneath of that, there is a nice steady, stable growth beat in our core paint business as well.", "Charles Dan - Morgan Stanley", "I guess you guys put a number out there of about $400 million a year from these programs. Do you have a sense for where we are relative to that number?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes, we are still saying that that number is a run rate number in '15, Charlie. That\u2019s what we said and when we expect to be there.", "Charles Dan - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, sorry, just had a question on capital structure. Where do you guys envision the steady state level of debt on the business as you look out to 2015 and beyond?", "James Muehlbauer", "So we are interested in remaining an investment grade company. If you look at our leverage ratios, they haven't changed materially over time. It provides us with an opportunity to continue to focus on growing the business. The good news is we have got plenty of capital to fund our growth initiatives while still being in the market looking at M&A transactions. We have firepower certainly to do that with the balance sheet while at the same time continuing the share repurchase activity that the company has done a nice job over the last few years. So we are not thinking materially different about the capital structure of the company going forward. I think embedded in that remains the opportunity for us to grow our business productively, both organically and through acquisitions.", "Operator", "Next we will go to the line of Steve Schwartz with First Analysis.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "I guess the first thing on Ace. You mentioned, Gary, that you expect to be in 3,000 stores which would be about two-thirds of the locations. I think when you took the private label or the Val branded opportunity over about a third of Ace stores, I think, already had a paint department with a brand in it. So can you parse out how many of the 3000 stores you will have actually didn't have a branded component in it before versus those that did?", "Gary Hendrickson", "So I think about 1300 of the 4000 plus stores had that brand that you are talking about.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Yes.", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think that most of those 1300 will be part of our program. In fact I know the number to be in excess of 80% of those stores will either be taking our brand exclusively or in conjunction with that other brand.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. Well, that's good news.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "That's good to hear. And then just as a follow-up, if I may beat a dead horse and hopefully you won't hold it against me, as you talk about the second quarter anniversary of the new programs, I think that kind of implies that you saw a revenue benefit from stocking over the past year for Lowe's Pro and perhaps the Ace private label manufacturing agreement. Can you quantify what that stocking contribution was to revenue?", "Gary Hendrickson", "No, I don\u2019t think so, Steve. It's not material.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay.", "Gary Hendrickson", "In Ace we ship to the warehouse and the warehouse ships to the Ace stores. At Lowe's we had a small load in at -- I guess in one month. But that ran through the P&L pretty quickly.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay. Then why would you expect the anniversary to see drop off in growth if from day one you were seeing demand just from organic?", "James Muehlbauer", "Steve, I think we are talking about different points, right.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "Okay.", "James Muehlbauer", "So I think your question is talking essentially about initial load-ins that would go along with launching a new program. All we are trying to say is that, as we move forward in the year, we are going to anniversary having Lowe's Pro in the mix for a full year now, and Ace private label in the mix for a full year. So we are not....", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis", "In the mix?", "James Muehlbauer", "In the mix, right. So we are not saying that we did a big load in Q2 last year. What we are saying is that we didn\u2019t have those businesses at the same level in Q1 of this year so we when we get into Q2, just mathematically year-over-year the growth rate is going to come down.", "Operator", "And next we will go to the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Co.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Co.", "Good morning and congratulations. You talked about the issues with shipping containers. Could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in the off-road markets? Have inventories come down at companies like Deere, for example? Do you see some kind of a pickup later in the year or is it a two years out type of project?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be that far out Rosemarie, but reading some of our -- reading our customers comments, the large customers in that segment, I think inventories are in much better shape this year than they were last year. We expect we will be selling to a normal production volume. However, neither of one of the big companies are calling for a particularly positive year. One of them reported this morning and I think I am right to say that they called out volumes to be more of a flat for the year. So that\u2019s the approach that we are taking with our business, is that we are going to approach it cautiously and we are going to manage our cost and we are not going to get too far out on the limb in terms of promising growth in that particular segment. I will say, though, that China is a different story. In China, we have seen a pretty significant pickup in activity in that market with some factories that were closed last year now producing vehicles. So that\u2019s a positive sign. The only thing that\u2019s to it, is that we are not static in that market. It's a large global market and we have a relatively small position of a large global market. So our teams are out winning new business in that market. And a big part of the reason that we are seeing improvement in our China business is, is business that we are doing with local manufacturers, as well as the multinationals. So I expect it to be a better year than last year but I don\u2019t expect it to have a material impact on the company.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Co.", "Okay. That is helpful. And I was wondering we always talk about Asia and Australia, can you remind me what kind of a business you have in Asia outside of those two major geographies? Or is it so small that it doesn't fall down to the bottom line or the top for that matter?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Asia and Australia. I am sorry?", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Co.", "I mean outside of Australia and China. You know, everyone is talking about growing in Southeast Asia, not really doing much in China. The two regions are kind of separated and I was wondering how big a business you had in Southeast Asia?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, we have a nice packaging business in Southeast Asia. We do some off-road business in Southeast Asia. And then we do wood coatings business in Southeast Asia. We have got a plant in Malaysia and we do business in all of the ASEAN countries. So I can't pull the exact number off the top of my head but it would probably be -- Southeast Asia would be 10% to 15% of our mix in Asia-Australia.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Co.", "And is it growing much faster than Australia and China?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, remember the segments that I just mentioned, packaging, which is growing. The packaging market in Southeast Asia is growing maybe 10% a year, something like that. We are participating in that as a leader in that industry. And the wood coatings market is growing as well I think. As manufacturers have left China and moved to Southeast Asia to get around the anti-dumping regulations on bedroom furniture, Southeast Asia has grown for us in our wood business, particularly Vietnam.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Co.", "Okay. No, that is very good. And if I could have a couple of quick housekeeping questions. Are we looking at interest expense levels for the next three quarters to be similar to that of the first which would give us about $64 million for the full year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Probably between $16 million to $17 million a quarter will be kind of the run rate.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Co.", "Okay. And same question for the share buyback. I know that you usually aim to lower your basic numbers of shares or the fully diluted share by 2% a year. The stock today is very strong. Are we expecting the number of shares for the full year to be similar to that of the first quarter or do you think that you will add to your repurchase?", "James Muehlbauer", "Yes, Rosemarie, we continue to think of that as an opportunity for us to build value for shareholders. As you know over the last couple of years we have purchased in excess of the 2% amount that you mentioned. So we see that as a continued part of our growth story and we think it's a great way to not only enhance shareholder returns while we invest in our business but also to demonstrate the confidence that we have in the ability to grow this business profitably for the long term.", "Rosemarie Morbelli - Gabelli & Co.", "Okay, that is helpful.

Thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company\u2019s Review of the Second Quarter 2014 Financial Results and Expectations for the Third Quarter and Full Year.", "With us on today\u2019s call are Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO; John Morikis, President and COO, Sean Hennessy, CFO; Al Mistysyn, Vice President, Corporate Controller and Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications.", "This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Vcall via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com, beginning approximately two hours after this conference call concludes, and will be available until Thursday, August 7th, 2014, at 5 pm Eastern Time.", "Following the company's review of the second quarter financial results and outlook for the third quarter and full year, we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Jessie and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you just heard, we've made an important addition to our earnings conference call lineup. Beginning with this morning's call, John Morikis, our President and Chief Operating Officer will be participating in our earnings conference call each quarter.", "Many of you had opportunities to speak with John over the years at our Annual Financial Community Presentation. He has a comprehensive knowledge of our operating divisions, customers, suppliers and our industry in general and because most of his discussions surrounding our earnings releases involve these topics it's only natural to include john in the conversation.", "We think you'll find his perspective on the state on the industry and our company very valuable. I am going to turn the call over to John in just a moment, but before I do, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in the company\u2019s earnings release transmitted earlier this morning.", "In the interest of time, we provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website under sherwin.com Investor Relations Second Quarter Press Release.", "With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our financial results for second quarter.", "John Morikis", "Thanks Bob. It's a real pleasure for me to take part on our call this morning and let me add my thanks to all of you for joining us.", "The press release we issued this morning summarizes a very solid second quarter for Sherwin Williams. We continue to see positive momentum in most areas of the business and we clearly had momentum in large part to our consistent focus and prudent investments made over the past five years.", "There are still some areas where we face challenges, but the progress we've made so far in this recovery and the bullish signals we are getting from our customers give us confidence that our momentum is sustainable.", "I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2014 compared to the second quarter of 2013, then comment on each reportable segment.", "Consolidated net sales increased 12.1% to a $3.04 billion, driven primarily by strong performance in our Paint Stores Group and acquisitions. The Comex acquisition added 4.6% to net sales in the quarter, while unfavorable currency translations decreased consolidated net sales 0.9%.", "Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $176 million year-over-year to $1.4 billion and gross margins increased 80 basis points to 46.3% of sales from 45.5% in the second quarter last year. This gross margin improvement was primarily the result of better operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume, which more than offset the anticipated gross margin drag from the Paint Stores acquired from Comex.", "Selling, general and administrative expense for the quarter increased 15.8% to [$969.2 million] [ph]. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased 31.8% in the second quarter this year from 30.8% last year. Higher SG&A spending in the quarter reflects our continued investment in new stores and sales territories plus incremental SG&A from acquisitions.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $16.4 million, an increase of $1.3 million compared to the second quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $48.3 million or 12.7% to $429.2 million. Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 32.1% compared to 32.5% in the second quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30s compared to last year's 30.7%.", "Consolidated net income increased $34.2 million or 13.3% to $291.4 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 9.6% compared to 9.5% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 19.5% to $2.94 per share including a $0.06 EPS loss from the U.S. and Canada assets acquired from Comex compared to $2.46 per share in 2013.", "Looking at our second quarter results by operating segments, Paint Stores Group had another strong quarter. Segment sales increased 17.2% to $1.88 billion and comparable store sales, sales by stores opened more 12 calendar months grew 9.8%.", "Comp store sales growth accelerated 190 basis points sequentially from first quarter 2014 and 280 basis points year-over-year. The rate of sales growth increased sequentially in every customer segment.", "Acquisitions added $103.7 million or 6.5% of sales in the quarter. Regionally, in the second quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions followed by our Southeastern division, Eastern division and Midwestern division.", "Paint Stores group segment profit for the quarter increased $42.9 million or 12.9% to $375.9 million as higher paint sales volumes were more than enough to overcome a $10.4 million loss on the acquired stores. Segment profit as a percent of sales decreased to 20% from 20.7% last year, but if you back out the effect of the acquisition, segment profit margin increased to 21.7%.", "During the quarter, we opened 16 new stores bringing our year-to-date total to 33 new locations. At quarter end, our total store count in U.S., Canada and the Caribbean was 3,941 compared to 3,542 locations at the end of the second quarter 2013. 98 of the 399 incremental stores were opened organically since the end of the second quarter 2013. This year our Paint Stores Group plans to add approximately 80 to 90 net new store locations.", "Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the quarter. Sales increased 10.1% to $433.4 million from $393.7 million last year. Acquisitions accounted for roughly half of the increase, while our domestic wood care and building materials business and Ronseal and Altax wood care businesses in Europe accounted for most of the organic sales improvement.", "Segment profit for the consumer group increased $13.4 million or 17% to $92.5 million in the quarter, driven by higher sales volumes, improved operating efficiencies and a profit contribution from acquisitions of $2.7 million. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 21.3% from 20.1% in the same period last year, which is gratifying to see following the softer profit performance in the first quarter.", "For our Global Finishes Group, second quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 6.1% to $544.6 million due to higher paint sales volumes and selling price increases. Most of Global Finishes Group's domestic business strengthened in the second quarter, but this improvement was partially offset by continued weakness outside the U.S., particularly in Latin America.", "Unfavorable currency translation had minimal impact on sales in the quarter compared to last year. Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased 0.7% in the quarter to $54.9 million from $54.5 million last year. These results include charges of $4.5 million related to the exit of our business interest in Venezuela. Unfavorable currency translation rates change reduced segment profit by $600,000.", "As a percent of net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit was 10.1% in the quarter compared to 10.6% last year. Our Latin America Coatings Group continues to operate in a very challenging economic environment. Second quarter net sales for the group stated in U.S. dollars decreased 8.9% to $181.2 million.", "Volumes in the quarter were negative and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 11.3%, both of which were mitigated to some degree by selling price increases. Segment profit in the second quarter stated in U.S. dollars increased to $5.7 million from $856,000 in the same period last year.", "In the second quarter 2013, we incurred a charge of $11.8 million related to a Brazil tax assessment. In the second quarter this year, lower volume sales, increased raw material cost, and unfavorable currency translations were only partially offset by selling price increases.", "Currency translation decreased segment profit $2.9 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 3.1% in the quarter, compared to 0.4% in the second quarter of 2013.", "Although our Latin American Coatings Group results for the quarter and year-to-date are disappointing, we're committed to extending our presence in this important region and we are dedicated and working with all of these sources and expertise required to succeed in that effort.", "Turning briefly to our balance sheet, our total debt on June 30, 2014 was $1.69 billion including short-term borrowings of $64.7 million. Total debt on June 30, 2013 was $1.69 billion. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $267.2 million, compared to $741.1 million at the end of the second quarter 2013 and $356.5 million at the end of last quarter.", "In the first six months of 2014, we spent $66.9 million on CapEx -- capital expenditure, depreciation expense was $83.5 million and amortization expense was $15.1 million. For the full year 2014, we anticipate capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $190 million to $200 million; depreciation will be about $170 million and amortization will be about $30 million.", "That concludes our review of results for the second quarter of 2014. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for the third quarter and full year.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks John and good morning, everybody. Let me begin by saying how pleased I am to have John with us on the call this morning. I am sure you'll find him to be very insightful addition to our conference call team both today and in the years ahead.", "At the midway point in the year, we are encouraged by how 2014 is shaping up. More than once in John's comments you heard him refer to the positive momentum in our business. Sales and volume growth began the year at a respectable pace and it appear to be picking up steam as the year progresses.", "Consolidated sales growth in the second quarter increased 280 basis points sequentially and June was our strongest month so far. Domestic spray equipment sales, perhaps an unscientific but nonetheless reliable leading indicator of paint sales, robust throughout the quarter.", "As John indicated most painting contractors including many who work in the non-residential markets are feeling very bullish about their order books going forward. Consumer group had another good sales quarter and Global Finishes is posting strong year-over-year volume gains in many industrial coatings categories.", "Consolidated gross margin also showed significant improvement both sequentially and year-over-year. This is a function of volume-driven operating leverage, but also of stable raw material cost. Early in the year, we identified titanium dioxide as an inflation risk in the second half.", "However, it was pretty apparent that the major chloride TiO2 producers have not yet succeeded in implementing price increase announced in the first two quarters.", "As I mentioned in our first quarter call, both of the outward pressure on industry raw material baskets is coming from high density polyethylene, which is driving up cost of plastic packaging.", "We've also seen higher year-over-year pricing trends in other raw material feed stocks such as crude oil, natural gas and propylene, ethylene and tinplate, but so far these are not effective raw material cost, we are maintaining our outlook for a relatively stable raw basket for the balance of the year.", "In the first six months of 2014, we generated $332 million in net operating cash, an increase of $30 million compared to the first half of 2013, driven by higher six month net income. Although working capital is a slight use of cash in the first half, which is entirely due to the accelerating pace of sales growth, our best measure of working capital efficiency, the ratio of working capital to sales, decreased to 11.7% of sales, from 12.0% in the second quarter last year.", "During the quarter, we acquired 2.03 million shares of the company stock with treasury, bringing our total year-to-date repurchase activity to 3.33 million shares at an average cost of $200.15 per share and total investment of $665 million.", "On June 30th we had remaining authorization require 8.83 million shares. Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.50 last year.", "Our confidence in the domestic building and remodeling markets continues to grow and we expect non-residential to play and increasingly important role in driving future paint and coating demand.", "Many of the industrial segments also appear to be gaining momentum. These positives will be offset to some degree by persistent challenging conditions in Latin America. Based on this outlook, we expect third quarter consolidated net sales to increase in the range of 9% to 14% compared to the third quarter 2015.", "With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income for common shares for third quarter to be in the range of $3.15 to $3.25 per share compared to last year's $2.55 per share.", "Guidance for the third quarter includes our expectations that the Comex acquisition will increase net sales $120 million to $130 million, and reduce diluted net income for common share by approximately $0.05 per share in the quarter. For the full year 2014 we expect consolidated net sales to increase 8% to 13% compared to last year.", "Although our sales expectations have not changed since our first quarter release, we are raising our expectations for full year diluted net income per common share be in the range of $8.50 to $8.70 per share compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013.", "Included in this full year guidance is our assumption that the Comex acquisition will increase net sales by a low single-digit percentage in the year and reduce diluted net income per common share $0.35 per share. The change in our full year EPS guidance was driven in part by lower than expected dilution from the U.S. and Canada Comex business from our original midpoint of $0.50 per share to our current expectation of $0.35 per share dilution.", "Integration of these businesses into our Paint Stores Group and Consumer Group is progressing ahead of our original expectations. We\u2019re on schedule and on budget with respective supply chain consolidation plans and performing better than planned from an operating profit standpoint.", "More importantly, we are very pleased with a level of talent, enthusiasm and commitment we see in the men and women to join Sherwin Williams through this acquisition. This, above all, will pay dividends for years to come.", "Again, we\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us this morning, and now we\u2019d be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial", "Yes, Chris. Just wondering, you know, what\u2019s making you more optimistic about the second half outlook, because it appears even \u2013 post you changing your Comex guidance that you\u2019re looking to about $0.23 improved earnings despite a similar sales outlook. Your contractors, as you indicated, seem pretty optimistic yet the housing data still seems somewhat mixed, so just wondering if you can reconcile those two conflicting items.", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, Don. I think that\u2019s a good point about the conflicting data we\u2019re seeing out of some of the housing numbers. We just were commenting about the most recent information. It seems that from quarter-to-quarter we have starts up permits down and the exact opposite the next quarter. I think we\u2019re still fairly bullish on the need for improved housing starts to get up to a more sustainable number. But don\u2019t forget that a solid 75% to 80% of all these architectural coatings are being used to maintain existing structures. And I think therein is the momentum that we\u2019re feeling, as John commented about, the anecdotal evidence we\u2019re getting from our contractors. We just think the second half is going to be strong.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial", "And then just a clarification on your same store sales growth of 9.8%, what was the price volume mix? How much of that first quarter price increase that you posted did you start to realize in the second quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "You know that price increase is going well then -- this is Sean Hennessy -- and when you do, we don\u2019t really break out all those different factors, but the majority of our selling price -- selling increase was volume.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial", "Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Don.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Thanks very much. Chris, you mentioned Comex was -- the integration was going faster than you expected and that provided some earnings leverage. Can you talk more specifically is that because you restructured contracts; took other cost out, what exactly has accelerated the benefit there?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s in any restructuring of contracts per se. [There are variable] [ph] contracts in a business like this when you\u2019re running your own dedicated store business. I think we\u2019re just getting better operating leverage for the company. Raw material cost, implementation of some of the shutdown activities have gone well, ahead of schedule, lower than expected cost impact. I think we have commented the sale of this business is still lagging what we\u2019re seeing in our core business. So it\u2019s mainly on the operating cost side that\u2019s coming in lower than expectation.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "And you mentioned your pretty impressive 10% Paint Stores sales, can you give us a sense what Comex is doing year-over-year and maybe what you think the overall U.S. architectural paint market might do in 2014.", "John Morikis", "I\u2019d say that the Comex stores are lagging our store sales, and which would be typical in an acquisition like this. As far as the entire market goes, we get that information that lags, but I\u2019d say we feel very comfortable that we\u2019re growing at a faster rate than market right now.", "Bob Koort - Goldman Sachs", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Hi guys. Good morning. First off on the Paint Stores Group, clearly volumes are well above what your competitor seem to be reporting as it has been the case last couple of quarters. Is this a function of the channel that you\u2019re exposed to, maybe commercial construction or just sort of continued share gains?", "John Morikis", "I\u2019d say that we\u2019re experiencing very good growth in all the segments that we play, so I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s any specific area. I think we really enjoy this controlled distribution model. We\u2019ve been working hard and investing in the service and products that respond to the customers\u2019 needs and we\u2019re comfortable with our performance.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "And just as a follow-on to that as commercial construction continues to improve generally speaking how does that affect the price mix component in the Paint Stores Group?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. We\u2019ve talked about that Ghansham, in the past, some of these larger projects will be at lower selling prices per gallon. But what we said, the SG&A associated with servicing that business really is lower as well so operating margins for this group will benefit from gallons that we gain in any one of these end market segments.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird", "Okay. Thanks so much guys.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, Ghansham.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fisher with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Duffy Fisher - Barclays", "Yes. Good morning, guys.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Duffy.", "Duffy Fisher - Barclays", "Two questions; may be first for Sean. On CapEx, this year\u2019s CapEx looks like it\u2019s even more back-end loaded than normal for you guys. Can you walk through why that\u2019s split is so skewed? And then if you strip out Comex, what was the underlying incremental margin for the Paint Stores Group?", "Sean Hennessy", "On the CapEx you\u2019re absolutely right. It\u2019s little backward, slanted toward the back. Again, as Comex conversion, Comex starts conversion they\u2019re going to start taking place here. We\u2019re going to start to see that CapEx ramp up. A few other projects that we had -- originally had early in the year we\u2019re going -- especially with IT then completing the IT implementation of system throughout the world.", "We\u2019ll have Latin America here completed by next April, but we have some expenses that are coming in. So really it\u2019s Comex and diversion of the stores and some other activities that we see coming in. And the flow through on the stores without Comex, I think John mentioned the 21.7% of sale, but without Comex when you look at that that will tell you we\u2019re probably incremental in the quarter of about $50 million in the sales, without Comex we\u2019re up around $280 million, so you\u2019re talking almost 35% incremental margin.", "Duffy Fisher - Barclays", "Okay, great. And then Chris, one question for you, a follow-on on bob\u2019s question. If Comex is going better early does that mean that the end point is higher than we thought originally, or do we just get to the same endpoint that we thought to get there quicker.", "Chris Connor", "I mean we\u2019re just getting to the endpoint on cost side. So as John mentioned, [inaudible] are yet to really be running at the kind of rate we expect and we get too eventually. So we still have some tough sledding ahead of us here.", "Duffy Fisher - Barclays", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thanks, Duffy.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Yes. Thank you. Chris, can you comment on the refinish business in light of the harsh winter we had? And did you see a pick up there in the spring? And can you also comment on the protective finishes business? Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. P.J., I\u2019m sorry if you could repeat it. I wasn\u2019t sure which business you\u2019re asking me to comment on relative to spring weather.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Yeah. Refinish business.", "Chris Connor", "Refinish business, are you talking about automotive refinish?", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Yes.", "Chris Connor", "John, you will take that?", "John Morikis", "Our business here in the U.S. was up slightly in the quarter. We\u2019re expecting that the customers that we\u2019re talking with are experiencing more business as a result of the winter, but we\u2019re up slightly here in the U.S.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "And then you have this sales force that goes out and bids on projects. What are they seeing in non-residential activity, any positives or negatives there?", "John Morikis", "Very positive. I would say that our contractor base in that space are feeling better -- much better this year versus last year, and quite frankly, much better this quarter than last quarter. So they\u2019re feeling very excited about the bidding activity. And as Chris mentioned, with the spray equipment purchases that we see that as an indicator of their confidence.", "Chris Connor", "John and I were out recently just meeting with some of these large commercial contractors and some of them said that we\u2019re not even taking any more bids right now. They\u2019re so full up for the next 18 months. And that we haven\u2019t heard that in years, so expecting really strong performance in that going forward.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "So would you say that that is may be in the high single-digit number?", "Chris Connor", "Just backed in to all the guidance we\u2019ve given you P.J. and we gave you the range I think it\u2019s either high single or low double-digits for the next quarter.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thanks P.J.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse", "Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, John.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse", "So with regard to SG&A, the 15% jump or $132 million change, how are you want to look at it year-over-year? How much of that, or how should we think about what the SG&A growth was for kind of, if you will, legacy Sherwin Williams versus say some of the Comex integration and from the cost around that.", "Sean Hennessy", "Again, the increase in the SG&A in the quarter and year-to-date really, really been driven by three factors. The Paint Stores Group, the new stores [indiscernible] the acquisition, the Comex assets operated at an SG&A rate materially higher than our consolidated SG&A, the sale, so as we anniversary that that will improve, and again, that investment I\u2019d mentioned in IT.", "So we\u2019re looking forward here, the SG&A was up 1.3% of sales as we\u2019ve mentioned in the first half of the year. We do expect to see that thread there to reduce. In fact, it\u2019s also part of the reason why we raised guidance. We expect the second half SG&A to be lower in percent of sales than it was last year in the last six months of the year.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a quick question on the Venezuelan assets, what was the normal kind of annualized earnings for those assets so we can kind of figure out how much to pull out?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yeah. The normalized -- it was less than $2 million a year. Unfortunately, over the last few years we\u2019ve been having sales profits there, but we could not get our cash out. So it was a small automotive refinish, but it is in Venezuela. So we picked some severance cost and we closed and we wrote our assets off totally, so that\u2019s why that was approximately $5 million because cash had accumulated and we could not get our cash out of Venezuela.", "Chris Connor", "Venezuela is to write that asset off.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse", "Okay. Great, thank you. And then one last question, with regard to the case of buybacks certainly things accelerated in the second quarter. I guess how should we be thinking about that going forward? Is this kind of a good run rate for a while, or was it just opportunistic, just seeing kind of what was in the pipeline?", "Sean Hennessy", "No. We\u2019ve taken a look at our cash flow for the year like we always do. We know how much cash we\u2019re bringing in. And what we said is by the end of the first quarter 2015 we\u2019ll be in a more normalized phase. So we actually have looked at this quarter and actually we did by two -- just over two million shares and that was actually in the form of an accelerated stock repurchase program. So we did that in the second quarter and we\u2019re evaluating what cost program we\u2019re going to do in the third quarter.", "Chris Connor", "I think it\u2019s not the way to think about that John is that we\u2019re sitting in a higher cash balance right now than is customary for us. We\u2019re heading into the two strongest cash generating quarters of the year for us. And you know what we\u2019d like to do with excess cash. So I would expect it would be reasonable to assume we\u2019re going to remain active in the stock.", "John McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse", "Great. Thanks very much for the color.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, John.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you, and good morning. Just wondering on the same store sales can you talk a little bit about as you\u2019re seeing more contractors coming in, or are you seeing the same amount of contractors just buying more product or better mix or how\u2019s that working?", "John Morikis", "Now we\u2019re seeing more contractors and we feel as though the share of wallet that we have with our existing customers is also growing. We\u2019re very excited with the progress that our stores organization is making with both existing and new customers.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And just one last follow-up on the non-res side of things, are there particular end markets that your guys are getting reports from that just leading enthusiasm?", "John Morikis", "No. Actually it\u2019s pretty well diversified growth pattern.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Vince.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. Good morning.", "Chris Connor", "Hi, Kevin.", "Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "How much did your sales of spray equipment increased in the quarter? And was that rate more than you had previously expected last quarter?", "John Morikis", "Yeah, Kevin, as you know, we don\u2019t give you specific sales on all those various products segments inside that stores business. So just to say that the whole business is running in comp stores and at high single-digits, spray equipment was probably leading that a little bit, so double-digit sales growth.", "Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Chris, I want to may be come back to an earlier question. I mean historically existing home sales growth has been a primary driver of demand for architectural coatings obviously, and it looks like economists have that metric in some cases anyway down a bit and yet you\u2019re seeing very robust growth. And so I\u2019m wondering why that might be the case? Is it the non-res move that you alluded to, share gains, lagging maintenance, all of the above, how would you try to square that circle?", "Chris Connor", "We\u2019ll let out our resident economist Dr. Wells take that.", "Bob Wells", "Good morning, Kevin. Speaking specifically to non-residential market, because we\u2019re getting contribution from other market segments as we\u2019ve already indicated, so on the residential side we think two things are happening. One is we\u2019re getting a list from home value appreciation, so more home owners who are staying in place are doing remodeling and redecorating projects.", "Secondly, if you look at the quality of the existing home transactions that are occurring now versus a year or two years ago, there\u2019s a far lower percentage of those transactions that are distressed or foreclosure-type sales. And as you\u2019ve heard us comment in the past, the owner occupant selling to a new owner occupant is the transaction that generates the more paying activity. We think we\u2019re benefiting from that shift.", "Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That helps. And then last one if I may, Chris, just welcome any thoughts you have on Lat-Am and whether or not we might see volume turn around to positive of territory there anytime soon?", "Chris Connor", "Yeah. When you\u2019re doing business in Latin America it\u2019s important that you look over longer segments. We\u2019re in one of these cycles where currencies running against us. And there\u2019s a couple of rough spots in their bigger country\u2019s economies. Having said that, and I think John commented on it, we\u2019re still very much committed to the region.", "We think there are opportunities for us to enhance our method of distribution and build out our infrastructure there. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re necessarily forecasting in this guidance that we\u2019re going to see volume growth in calendar year 2014, but rest assure we\u2019ll be working hard to get that fixed by 2015.", "Kevin McCarthy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thanks very much for the thoughts.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, Kevin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Hello, thank you. First question just one, if you look back to last third quarter, Chris, it was a very strong quarter for you guys both year-over-year and I think on seasonally adjusted basis as well.", "And so you\u2019re going up against a tougher comp, but you\u2019re seeing a lot in pipelines you talked about driving out acceleration or a pretty similar acceleration and growth now versus the second quarter of this year. If you look across the major end channels of home improvement or repaying on the residential side, new construction residential and non-res, what\u2019s accelerating the most right now as you think about that pace?", "Chris Connor", "Yes. So I think as John has commented, we\u2019re seeing a very broad-based recovery here, Dennis, across all these segments. New residential has been strong, residential repaint which is the largest segment, we\u2019ve been commenting on that one now for multiple quarters. Both of those will be double-digit increases over previous years to help drive comp number in to that high 9 percentage. That\u2019s encouraging for us to see those two numbers doing so well because they are the lion\u2019s share.", "As John also mentioned the non-residential segments, particularly new construction in that are which has been lagging for some time, we\u2019re really starting to see a lot of lift there as well too. So this looks like heading into a back half where we\u2019re going to be hitting on just about every cylinder.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "So you talked about earlier the disconnect on some of the macro, if you just looked at new construction, residential, it is that a disconnect for you guys, are you guys seeing acceleration versus so to say, trends on a macro side?", "Chris Connor", "Our business in very strong in new residential. One of the anomalies in the June print that just came out this morning is that most of the weakness in start were in South and that has been very strong for the about year to date. So whether that was a one month lift or something the beginning of a trend we will see, but new resident in general has been very strong.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Perfect. Helpful. And then Sean on the Comex acquisition the trend in margins, I think what you said here now we are going to get to the targeted margin sooner, any update on how you can think about the momentum in 2015 versus what you said may be high single digit type numbers in 2015 for the acquired business.", "Sean Hennessy", "We were looking at high single digits. I think that we are watching how the year ends, but I think that is probably good a guidance that we can give you right now. I think probably at the end of the third quarter or fourth quarter and fourth quarter for sure, will probably be able to update that, but right now we don\u2019t see any changes to that guidance.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. All right. Thanks and good luck.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thank you, Dennis.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Thanks. Two questions. One on gross margin and consumer. On the gross margin, how much did Comex hurt in the quarter year-over-year and what did mix do to help.", "Sean Hennessy", "Greg as you know, I don\u2019t think we have ever given the metrics. Our gross margin with and without it was dilutive and it has been dilutive. The only think I will say is given you a range at the beginning of the year 45 to 46 versus 45 last year and now as the year is going through and now we believe we are going to be at the high end to that range.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Got it. And then second on the Consumer Group. A nice improvement there, I think it was acquisitions was half of it and then volume was 5% as well in fact it was driven by retail. Could you describe that a little more, was it -- did you sign up any new distribution or was it was just strong sell through or what you really account for that.", "Sean Hennessy", "We have a new program that we're roaring into Home Depot that we were excited about in our conference line. We've also, as I mentioned seen some nice improvement out of our European operations as well as our building materials.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Of the 5% volume, would you say that those two were majority of them.", "Sean Hennessy", "The largest one would have been Home Depot.", "Greg Melich - ISI Group", "Home Depot, great. Thanks a lot. Good luck.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thank you, Gregg.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts - UBS", "Thanks for taking my call. There are couple businesses I guess that might come available for sale here in North America and you seemed to be going at a measured pace, which you repurchase, keep your flexibility. Could you talk about the M&A pipeline?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yeah John. So we've been very clear and open and transparent with the street in terms of the types of properties that would be of interest to us. We would agree that there are some interesting names in North America as well as in our industrial coating segments globally but nothing further to comment on at this time.", "John Roberts - UBS", "Okay. And then secondly the plan A in Latin America was to get scale to get the margins to improve there. Is there a plan B given scale doesn\u2019t look achievable and at least in the near term that I can see.", "Chris Connor", "Most of the plan B John and that C and D has to go along with that one. Just as you were representing M&A opportunities there are a number of interesting names and companies that we respect throughout Latin America. So we're certainly not done thinking about building scale through M&A throughout Latin America.", "And also as has been our practice, we are a company that's focused on our core development. We have good scale already in these countries. We are not the market share leader in the larger economies, but call it second or third and that's not a bad position to build from.", "So we have a number of imitative to really ramp up our own core group as well as to continue to think about M&A and I think as we commented earlier that you know we are very focused on this region and we expect to do better in 2015.", "John Roberts - UBS", "Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Nil.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "On the Comex -- is Comex going to be more dilutive in the fourth quarter than it is for any of the other quarters and if so why would that be the case.", "Chris Connor", "Yeah, when you take a look at the year-to-date -- when you think about the year-to-date loss on Comex $0.45 and it's compared to the 35 and then compared to last year, it won't be any dilutive. It's 18 and it's 17 in the second half of the year, but they have a sell curve just like our Stores Group and if you take a look at that volume they are closer to the breakeven points in that third and fourth quarter -- I am sorry, the first and fourth quarter and that's why they are more dilutive.", "Years ago if you looked to our Stores Group in the first and fourth quarter, when we were closer to the breakeven we had the same phenomenon, but we will get there with the Comex stores with higher volumes, but until that happens the first and fourth quarter will be a bigger drag than the rest of the Paint Stores Group.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "Okay. That makes sense. Then in terms of having the point of sale in the Comex Stores now for a couple months is there anything you are seeing, I know before in the past you guys have said that there is pricing, lower pricing and lower fill rates. Is there anything new that you\u2019ve seen that you can make improvements on and work for those? How quick those get to share one type level.", "Chris Connor", "We are very excited with what we are learning to the POS and we are excited about the future. We're going to be able to leverage that POS much like we do in our own stores understanding our customers better.", "To your point about pricing, a basket approach, what are they purchasing from us and what they are? So we're excited about that and as we go into next year, we're going to leverage that.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "Great. And then just finally I know Latin America now seems like almost unfortunately a bit of an afterthought in terms of profitability and you are certainly looking to improvement it by 2015, but is there any reason that it won't get any worse.", "Sean Hennessy", "Yeah. I think that we have currency headwinds and if you think about especially the first Brazil real the third quarter and fourth quarter can be better comparisons for us.", "If you look at Argentina, right now we have been running at that 8% versus 5%, that will be 8% versus 6% in the second half of the year that's a little bit of difference, but it continue to evaluate in that third and fourth quarter, but operationally I don\u2019t think that we still feel we're strides and improvement our operation. So except for that, I think that you know I don\u2019t see it going backwards from here.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "And how much of you have been able to offset the currency drag with pricing.", "Sean Hennessy", "Well, I think that when you talk -- if points were failed and shall we get the amount of currency drag when it's over 11% and again in U.S. dollars we were down around 8% and there were some volumes that did backwards, so we gave some price.", "Nils Wallin - CLSA", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thank you, Nils.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Good Morning.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Eric.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Two things. First of all the earning guidance change for the quarter and the back half of the year it looked like you have affirmed the sales guidance and increased the earnings guidance.", "So the assumptions that margins are better and Sean I know you commented about how SG&A looks into the second half versus first half, but can you provide a little bit more color inside of the core earnings guidance change. The sales mix is different or the margin is different especially out a little bit.", "Sean Hennessy", "We don\u2019t see the sales mix changing dramatically from our original guidance. Eric, I think it really comes down to the gross margin. We did mention 45 to 46. We're at 45 halfway through the year. We think for the full year we're going to be at the high end in the next guidance.", "The SG&A we did mention you know the first half of the year, the comparisons were bad. We had more new stores earlier this year than we ever have. Some of the things that we were going to start anniversary we think our SG&A in the last six months will actually be below the last six months of last year. So still good thing. So I think that it's the margin in total and that's because of sales mix just because of things that are occurring and getting some of those other things out of the way in the first half of the year.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Is the SG&A stand different in the back half than what you originally expected or is there something different within that relative to where you started that you are thinking.", "Sean Hennessy", "I think the SG&A spend will probably be slightly below what we originally thought at the beginning of the year, but not dramatically. And I think importantly in that Eric, the SG&A spend is lower because we are integrating the stores better, we are gaining efficiency there haven\u2019t been a whole sales decision to whack programs in marketing, advertising, training, R&D, etcetera. So this is just really the company continuing to add efficiency around the fringes as we integrate businesses.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "And then second question, Chris for you. Strategically you went through a period of time with acquisitions outside of the U.S., outside of the U.S. architectural business, I heard your comment earlier about sale of Latin America, so I am just curious as you think strategically about the portfolio and acquisitions from hear and if you could give us a sense of your thoughts or your priority or what's important for you going forward.", "Chris Connor", "I think this management team has been pretty much locked on a pretty logical strategy here for quite some time Eric that hasn\u2019t changed at all. We like the architectural coatings businesses in the Americas and we recognize that our industrial coatings are competing in a global environment or wherever we can find controlled distributions to support those American businesses or add technologies, infrastructure, important geographies and/or customers to the industrial coatings will be at the table and discussing those opportunities.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research", "Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Eric.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of [Arun Viswanathan] with RBC Capital Market. Please proceed with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys. Thank you for taking my question. Good to be back covering chemicals. How the customers I guess been responding to the price increase? May be if you can just describe their behavior or given that you do expect a flat rock bucket.", "Chris Connor", "Not really been an issue I would say with our customers. And we've had a logical discussion with them and we continue to provide them with a good quality product and great service and it's really behind us.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Great. And then I guess -- I just wanted to delve into the earlier comments you mentioned that you were seeing strength in the South and maybe you can just highlight what you're seeing growth on the res and non-res side regionally speaking and if there is any differences.", "Chris Connor", "As Bob mentioned the strong performance that we are having in the new residential has been in the south. We've also had good performance in parts of Northern Area and then Western and Eastern as well. Commercial has really been strong. It's really been quite strong across all segments across all our regions.", "Sean Hennessy", "It's been our practice to kind of give you that ranking of where the strength is coming from and so we've continued on and sometimes when we are preparing our thoughts to share with you, we think about when all the segments are doing so strong in all the geographies, it really kind of splitting areas to tell you which parts of country you are doing better. So this is really a business through the Stores Groups that is just delivering across the country, across all segments as John commented on them.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Great thank you a lot.", "Chris Connor", "Thank.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line Jay McCanless with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee", "Hi. Good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about Latin America in a different way. Do you think the volume softness this quarter had more to do with the World Cup than an actual drop-off in demand? And then the second part of that, when you look at 2015 and 2016 and what the economists are expecting for housing growth and then commercial growth, what does that outlook -- what does that look like.", "Chris Connor", "I don\u2019t know that we want to say that it was a World Cup influence our results and there are markets that we would say are impacted by the economic conditions or the environment and there is somewhere we just need to perform better and that\u2019s we are working on. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of your question.", "Sean Hennessy", "So the expectation on the market conditions going forward, Jay, I guess we have confidence that when we look behind the results today, the housing needs going forward in Mexico, the infrastructure, that hasn't been maintained as appropriately it is a should have been perhaps in Brazil, the demand for the types of products and services we provide, we'll have to have a rebound going forward. And I think that's why we continue to stay hard at it, improving our operations investing and trying to build out our network.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee", "Okay thank. And then the second question I have just in the U.S. if you look at single family housing demand versus multifamily housing demand. Is multifamily an increasing portion of your business and what types of numbers do you get there whether on profit margin or on volume growth relative to what you see in single family.", "Bob Wells", "Jay, this is Bob. With respect to demand, multifamily is a larger component of a new construction markets than it was during the last cycle. And we think that's probably going to be true for some time although as you know the multifamily size is really voluble and to oscillate quarter to quarter and year to year.", "We think that for the time being that the U.S. is going to be more of a renders market than an owner's market for some time to come. From a margin standpoint we've always commented that it really doesn\u2019t affect us from an operating margin standpoint all of the segments that have very comparable operating margin.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee", "Okay great.", "Chris Connor", "Jay, the one positive on the multifamily side is that while single family homes the maintenance activity in those homes is kind of a mix of DIY to contractor on the multifamily side, it is overwhelmingly maintained by contractors, which plays to our strength.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Great. Thank guys. Appreciate it.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Jay.", "", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Good morning, guys and congratulations on quarter.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Dmitry", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "I would like to touch base on your corporate expense line. It's been off pretty material year-over-year. Some of it obviously Comex, but a lot of it is probably not Comex. So in the context of your SG&A in the second half of the year being down as a percentage of sales versus second half of last year, how much of that is going to be corporate expense versus just better margins in the operating businesses?", "Chris Connor", "Even with the Admin expense we were up $31 million in the first half of the year and as we take a look at the -- take that down at $25 million, that split really between stock compensation and other compensation such as bonus and the IT projects that we've been working on.", "The second half of the year, we don\u2019t think we are going to be up the $31 million. So that's going to help, but even if we were up, when you add up $31 million, that's a nice improvement, but really the SG&A is really been driven by the operating division.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "Okay. Got it. And then can you provide us with updates, if anything is going on, or any changes with respect to the litigation in California, how that's progressing, and also given the news in the market with PBG taking a run at Comex, if that's changing at all, your mutual animosity in the courts with the Comex owner.", "Chris Connor", "Dmitry with respect with California Litigation, there is really no changes in the status of that suite since our last call. As you know last quarter, we announced that the final judgment was entered against three companies. We immediately filed a Notice of Appeal in that judgment and we are currently waiting for the record to be transmuted from the trial court to the Court of Appeal.", "It tends to be a fairly long process. We think the record would probably be transferred in the third quarter. At that point the court will initiate a briefing schedule, which is going to take at least five months and once and then all arguments will begin and once all arguments conclude it's another 90 days for the court to render a decision.", "All totaled we continue to believe that the decision by the Court of Appeals is going to take approximately two to three years. As far as the Comex issue is concerned we are still in arbitrator and there is still a lawsuit filed by Sherwin Williams in the New York Court and at this stage we are in the process of selecting arbitrators.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research ", "Got it. Then not to beat the dead horse to death here, but in terms of your Latin-American operations obviously there's not much you can do without the facts other than maybe push through pricing which you have been doing, but for you to turn that business around and the performance of that business and actually get out on a positive trajectory either this year or next year, is there anything that you guys can do internally or do you have to rely basically on the currency and the end markets improving?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, there's a lot we can do internally, Dmitry and it's the same kind of playbook that we assume run the company deliver the results we have. We need to knock on more doors, call on more painting contractors move more gallons of paint, be more efficient.", "When the economies come back and the currency runs our direction, it will be really, really good. In the mean time, we're working on the things that we can control.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "So are you increasing your sales presence there in terms of outside sales people and how do you bang on more doors?", "Sean Hennessy", "We have invested in more people to promote our sales and our gallons in the marketplace absolutely.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research", "All right. Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Dmitry.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Chris Connor", "Good morning, Eugene.", "Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Congratulations on a good quarter.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you.", "Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Couple of questions on store group sales for the quarter, if you can comment on anything that you\u2019ve seen maybe something outside of normal seasonal improvement and also maybe you can comment on sales in first half of July here.", "Sean Hennessy", "We mentioned the time is good and all segments across all of our divisions and that momentum is continuing here as we begin July.", "Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks and a question on DIY customers of your stores. I think previously you\u2019ve talked about gaining market share in that particular segment. Just wondering if that's still the case, you are seeing strong growth in DIY presence and how was 4th July weekend for that segment I guess?", "Chris Connor", "Performance in DIY is also strong. The weekend was good for us as well and again the momentum is continuing.", "Eugene Fedotoff \u2013 KeyBanc Capital Markets", "Great. Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Eugene.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas - JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Thanks very much. I imagine that sequentially your tin prices in North America went up, is everything now priced in so that tin prices sequentially going forward should be flattish or is there still more realization to come?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think the price increase we've realized what we're going to get from the price increase. We don't see a big improved increase in the third or fourth quarter Jeff.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "And you commented before that you thought that the TiO2 market was benign for the remainder of the year, when you look out over the next two or three years, do you still see it as benign or you do you see it as changing?", "Chris Connor", "Jeff, it's always based on the balance and supply and demand in the market. Coatings demand in North America should continue to grow as we move back towards normalized levels. That said as you know, there is plans on the drawing board for a new high-capacity TiO2 plant in Mexico. There is continuing supply growth coming out of Asia Pacific. So it just all depends on how on the timing of those factors.", "Jeff Zekauskas - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Thank you and good afternoon now I guess.", "Chris Connor", "Good afternoon, Richard.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay. In the consumer group the profit contribution from Comex at $2.7 million is that all flowing from the sales gain? My math is the $19.7 million or does some of that flow through from the paint stores like what happens in the legacy Sherwin Williams.", "Sean Hennessy", "No that income is actually from a couple different sources that are in consumer group. The duck back products as well as the viewer business we have up in [tied in] (ph) Canada, so that process is really not being driven by the stores group.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay. Good. Okay. And second question, I guess you are trying to answer this, but for the second quarter alone for Comex, your profit, the loss was smaller than you thought, but the sales were clearly at or below the low end of your projection, what's going on -- why are the stores -- Comex stores lagging your expectations?", "Chris Connor", "Why are they lagging our expectations, we expected them to be behind and they are. As we commented, Richard when we made this acquisition, that this was a troubled asset in North America and we are building these stores out and improving their inventory position and we've already talked about the equipment etcetera and so it's going to take us a while to reestablish those relationships and get those gallons and customers coming back.", "John talked about the things we're learning in this for example, the ability to add on associated product sales for equipment etcetera and these all things that are we're going to be working on aggressively going forward.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay. Fine. Now you just came out I guess the stores -- Comex stores business, which is at the low end of your expectations for the quarter.", "Chris Connor", "Well actually expectations we gave were $0.10 dilutive for the Comex that's in the second quarter. We actually were $0.06 dilutive.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Baked in sales, the sales\u2026", "Chris Connor", "Right. They're at the low end of -- sales that are still at the low end of the expectation, that's correct.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay. Thanks a lot for your time guys.", "Chris Connor", "Thank you, Richard.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research", "I can't believe it I still have questions left to ask. Thanks for extending the call. Couple things, I was curious first I want to make sure we get the gross profit dollar changes if it's possible by segment before we get off and then just can you tell us about what your competitors are doing?", "They seem to be really busy on the acquisition front, whether it's your North America last year and then down in Mexico? I am just wondering strategically how you view that and what you would like to do to kind of fortify yourself?", "Sean Hennessy", "I'll take the gross margin dollar real quick here, so we get that -- make sure we get that, our Paint Stores Group were up $142,500,000 million, consumer was up $21,959,000, our Global Finishes Group were up $8,418,000 and Latin America Group was up $4,211,000.", "Then regarding our competitors there and we've long commented about this terrific industry that we compete in that we're blessed with really outstanding companies to compete against.", "We respect the strategies and performance of all these folks and we look forward to meeting them on the battle field and I think our results as John commented earlier particularly in the area of share gains, we're showing that we're pretty confident. We've got a good model here. We're going to continue to work it hard.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research", "Thanks and just last thing, you wanted to get your cash balance down, is it fair to assume that historically you were kind of sub $100 million in terms of cash you would like on the balance sheet. Should we assume that that's about right for your long term or do you think you need more of these?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes we think that we don't think we need -- we need liquidity sources. Our liquidity sources are strong, but I believe our cash flow will be below $100 million again in the future.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research", "Thanks guys. Have a great quarter.", "Sean Hennessy", "Thank you, Aram.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears there are no further question at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks Jessie. As always, I will be available for the balance of today, tomorrow and throughout the coming weeks and to your any follow-up questions you might have.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Seymour. Please go ahead, sir.", "William Seymour", "Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2014 third quarter earnings call. We have 2 speakers today who will provide insights on our business and the third quarter results we announced this morning: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we have plenty of time to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valsparglobal.com.", "And finally, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations of our reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary Hendrickson.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Thank you, Bill, and good morning, everyone. We had a very good quarter. Every major product line in our company grew in our Q3 and our diverse business portfolio continues to deliver strong results. Net sales increased 10% and adjusted EPS increased 13% in the quarter. These results were driven by a number of factors, including the successful integration of acquisitions, strong performance from China and Europe, improved sales and profitability in our Coatings segment, benefits of new growth initiatives, investments in innovative products and the positive impact of productivity initiatives.", "I'll now cover some of the highlights of the quarter. Coatings segment sales grew 6%, excluding Inver. Including Inver, sales grew 16%. All major product lines within the Coatings segment grew in volume and sales over last year. Within the segment, Packaging had its eighth consecutive quarter of growth with sales increasing mid-single-digits as we continue to increase our global market share. Packaging volumes increased in all major geographic regions and included strong growth in non-BPA Coatings. Sales in the General Industrial product line were up mid-single-digits over last year, excluding Inver. This is the third consecutive quarter of improvement in sales trends, driven by market share gains and modestly improving end markets in some geographies. And in Europe, the integration of Inver continues to progress extremely well. Sales in Coil coatings grew mid-single-digits, driven by new business wins and improving customer demand. And our Wood product line grew sales mid-single-digits and has been a strong performer, benefiting from new business wins in China and the improving U.S. housing market.", "Moving now to our Paints segment. We performed well in all regions and sales increased 4%. Our Paints segment benefited from strong growth in international markets. In China, sales grew double-digits. In Australia, sales grew high single-digits in local currency. This is our best sales growth in Australia since we acquired this business in 2010. Our rollout with B&Q in the U.K. continued to progress well in the third quarter. We're now selling Valspar Paint in 250 B&Q stores and are reformatting the rest of the stores for deployment later this year.", "Now before I talk to you about the U.S., let me answer the question you may have, which is if sales increased 4% and international markets performed well, why did EBIT decline? The answer is that we experienced low single-digit sales growth in the U.S. in Q3 because of large shipments made in the second quarter in advance of the Valspar Reserve launch at Lowe's and Valspar Paints at Ace. The EBIT decline was driven in large part by the planned investments in advertising and marketing to support these initiatives.", "So let me provide a couple of comments that will give some context in our U.S. paint sales over the last 6 months. First, if you combine Q2 and Q3 this year and compare it to the same quarters last year, our U.S. paint sales were up double-digits and volume increased mid-single-digits. Second, importantly, sales at retail of Valspar Paint in Q3 were strong. So we're pleased with our performance over the last 6 months. The paint season in the U.S. has been solid and sales of Valspar-branded paint have been strong.", "In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we've made and the market share gains of our major businesses. The improved results in our Coatings segment coupled with the growth investments we are making in the Paints segment really shows the benefits of our diverse product mix, strong competitive positions and broad global exposure. We have executed well in many key initiatives so far this year, including the integration of Inver, big launches of new initiatives in retail paints, growing our Coatings segment volumes, restructuring our manufacturing costs and continuing to drive improved productivity.", "Based on our year-to-date performance and our current outlook for the fourth quarter, we are updating our annual fiscal 2014 sales guidance to approximately 9% growth, which is the high end of our previous range. And we are also updating our adjusted earnings per share guidance to $4.05 to $4.15 per share. With that, I'll turn it over to Jim, who'll provide some additional detail and context for the quarter.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Thanks, Gary. This morning, I will review the key drivers behind our performance in the third quarter and discuss our expectations for the balance of the fiscal year.", "Starting first with our performance in Q3. Sales growth of 10% was led by volume gains in both our Coatings and Paints segments. These gains were driven by volume growth from new business wins in many of our product lines and from the Inver acquisition.", "Looking at the Coatings segment. Sales increased 16%, driven primarily by the Inver acquisition and included growth in all major product lines. Excluding acquisitions, Coatings sales increased 6%, which was an improvement over the last 2 quarters when sales were up 2% and down 1% respectively. Gary has already covered the key drivers behind the performance in the Coatings product lines in the quarter. I will focus my comments on providing you with a few more details on the sales and volume performance.", "Packaging sales were up mid-single-digits and volume increased low single-digits. All of our major geographic regions grew Packaging volumes during the third quarter. Sales in the General Industrial product line improved in the quarter. Total sales increased mid-single-digits in local currency, excluding Inver. This performance reflects continued improvement over the declines experienced last year and in the first half of fiscal 2014. Coil product line sales and volumes were up mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Volume growth benefited from the improved demand after difficult weather conditions in the U.S. during the first half of the year. Wood product line sales increased mid-single-digits and volume was up double-digits, driven by strong growth in China.", "Moving on to the Paints segment. Total sales increased 4% and volumes were up high single-digits. Volume growth was driven by double-digit increases in both China and Australia. As Gary discussed earlier, Q3 volume in the U.S. was impacted by shipments made to customers during Q2 to support the introduction of Valspar Reserve and the branded paint rollout at Ace. As you may recall, volume in the U.S. was up more than 10% in Q2.", "With that overview of sales complete, let's discuss the drivers behind gross margin. We finished the quarter with total gross margin of 34.9%, an increase of 80 basis points over last year. The increase was driven by improved sales mix in both the Coatings and Paints segments, leverage benefits from higher volumes and continued productivity initiatives. Gross margins expanded in both the Coatings and Paints segments.", "Shifting to expenses. OpEx in the third quarter increased 160 basis points to 21.1% of sales. We increased spending to support the key growth initiatives we discussed earlier. These initiatives are focused on providing profitable growth for the company but require investments today that we can leverage more fully as these initiatives grow. The increase in OpEx in the quarter versus last year was driven by 3 main factors, which explain most of the $42 million increase in operating expenses.", "First, we increased investments in support of new retail initiatives and brand-building activities in the Paints segment. These include higher advertising, marketing and overhead expenses for these businesses, which explains approximately half of the incremental year-over-year spend. Second, our expenses include the addition of Inver, which represents approximately 1/4 of the OpEx increase. And finally, we had higher variable incentive compensation expense in the quarter, which represents approximately $8 million of incremental year-over-year spend in Q3. As I discussed on the Q2 call, the increased incentive expense reflects the normal level of bonus for the year compared to the lower-than-normal bonus amounts from last year. Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 4% and adjusted EBIT margins finished at 13.7% in the third quarter.", "In the Coatings segment, adjusted third quarter EBIT of $122 million increased 21% over the previous year and was 18.3% of sales. The increase in EBIT was a result of Inver, the benefits from leveraging higher sales volumes, improved sales mix and productivity initiatives. In the Paints segment, the EBIT decline was primarily driven by incremental expenses to support new retail initiatives. These investments during the quarter offset improvements in volume and sales mix in the Paints segment. In total, Paints EBIT of $44 million was down 16% from the prior year and was 9.2% of sales.", "Looking at the balance of the P&L. Our tax rate improved, and we have an opportunity for a lower effective annual tax rate than we estimated at the start of the year. The Q3 adjusted tax rate of approximately 30% was lower than last year, driven by strong performance in our China and Europe businesses and benefits from tax credits related to specific capital projects in fiscal 2014. We now expect our annual tax rate to be between 31% and 32% for fiscal 2014. This compares to our previous expectation of 32% to 33%. We continue to make good progress on our restructuring activities, which will improve our ability to effectively serve customers. Through the first 3 quarters of the fiscal year, pretax restructuring charges totaled $28 million.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $526 million, an increase of 26% versus the prior year. This increase was the result of the addition of Inver and investment in inventory to support new growth initiatives, like Valspar Reserve, Ace and B&Q and other new business wins in the portfolio. Year-to-date adjusted cash flow from operations, which excludes restructuring expenses, was approximately $183 million, a decline of 16%, which reflected the timing of inventory and other working capital investments related to our growth initiatives. We expect cash flow from operations to return to more historical trends as we annualize the impact of these initiatives.", "Wrapping up the highlights from the quarter. We repurchased approximately 1.1 million shares of the company's stock for a total investment of $81 million. Now looking to the balance of the fiscal year, we are updating our annual fiscal 2014 sales guidance to approximately 9% growth and have updated our adjusted annual earnings per share guidance to $4.05 to $4.15.", "Before we open the call for your questions, I hope you noted in our release this morning that we are hosting an Analyst Day in New York on December 3 this year. We're excited to take people through our business in more detail, discuss our opportunities going forward and to have you meet our senior leadership team. More details will be coming soon for this event and we hope you can make it.", "With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "The Coatings side seems to be hitting stride here and the Paints side seems to be in investment to get some growth on the horizon. Can you help us -- I know you're not going to call out the specific level of promotional spending. But can you give us some sense of how we should expect maybe the SG&A of the sales line progress as you go through the next year and you get deeper into the ramp of these new retail initiatives?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, Bob. Thanks for your question, I'll let Jim answer that, and I'll be available here to follow up if you have one.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Sure. So first, Bob, maybe if we can just take a step back for a minute before we look at kind of the individual quarters and the segments. The new business wins that Valspar has been successful in delivering this year has led to performance in Q1, Q2 and Q3 that takes a little bit more explaining, given how it's rolled into the business. So what I thought I could do is maybe to step up for a minute and just remind folks that when we started the year, our plans in total for the company called for sales growth in the high single-digits and double-digit EPS growth. Those plans included the significant investments that we were expected to make this year to grow our Paints business, both in the U.S. and in Europe, with the new business initiatives. The good news is year-to-date, that's essentially what's played out in our total financial results. A little bit more difficult to see if you look individual quarter. But if you look at all the quarters together, as you can see from our top line and bottom line, that's what happened. Looking to your question specifically, Bob, in the Paints segment, our year-to-date EBIT growth has essentially been flat. And that growth has really been limited by the investments that we've made in our biggest market in the U.S. to grow the business, launch new products and expand distribution. Much of the increased investment that we made in the year obviously has been focused during the key paint-selling season, which was Q2 and Q3. So when we look at the third quarter, we continued to increase investments to a similar level that we had saw in the second quarter. But the big thing in the Paints segment in the third quarter, Bob, is that we just didn't have the same level of volume growth that landed in the third quarter, given the pre-shipments that we made in advance of the selling season in Q2. That's the real reason why the EBIT decline was a little bit deeper in Q3 than Q2 for the Paints segment. Probably most importantly for us and for investors, is the investments that we had made this year are really our opportunity to launch those businesses in the portfolio, expand distribution and they're investments that we can continue to leverage as we grow those initiatives further. And as I mentioned on the Q2 call, we expected that our expenses in the Paints segment, the year-over-year growth would decline in the fourth quarter. So we expect to see a little less pressure from expenses overall. So expenses in the Paints segment are still expected to be up in the fourth quarter but not near to the extent that we saw in the last 2 quarters.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And can you talk a little bit about the history at Ace? I know they've said good things about their paint business this year. But what the mix historically has been between private label and branded? And if you would anticipate any change in that, given the greater promotional effort to feature the paint section at Ace?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I think, Bob, I think it's been rough. So this is my best estimate to try to give you an answer to the question. I think it's been 30-70 or so, private label to branded. And absolutely, we expect that mix to change over time. That's the whole thesis of our investment in branding this year. And I think our retail partner's committed to that as well.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Just as a quick follow-up to the expenses that you've talked about. So when we get into next year, does this level of expenses on a quarter-over-quarter basis sort of stay the same? Are the initiatives unchanged? Or does that lessen because there's more of an upfront expense, and so expenses, I guess, all else equal should decline?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes. Ivan, it's Gary. So we just want to be careful about not talking about next year until our fourth quarter conference call as is always the case. But let me just say this. Next year, we expect to sell more paint than we did this year. We expect our business to grow both through growth with an improving economy and the things that we're doing in terms of investment. And we expect the investment that we need to generate that growth to decline from this year.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my follow-up question, your Packaging business seems to be outperforming, I guess, your competitors fairly significantly. Would you describe that as all -- you did point out that sort of un-BPA-related volume is also doing real well. What regions and what product lines are you gaining the most market share? Or is it all in non-BPA?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Well, non-BPA, Ivan, is still a relatively small portion of the overall mix that we sell in our Packaging coatings business. But it is growing at a much faster rate than the overall business. We think the investments that we've made over the last 6 or 7 years in developing new technology for that business are paying off. As the market continues to convert through desires of consumers for non-BPA Coatings, we're positioned to win in that space. As we said in the opening comments, we grew our volume and sales in every geographic region this quarter. The take-up of non-BPA Coatings has been most pronounced in Europe with North America being second, very little in Asia and Latin America. So as we think about our total business, we're pleased that we were able to grow in every region, non-BPA was part of it. But I think just excellent execution of our business plan is the main reason.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Great. And Packaging is one of your more profitable businesses, correct?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Our entire Coatings segment is profitable.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Your paint sales grew 4%, but your volume grew 8%. What's the connection between those numbers? How do we get from 8% to 4%?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. Jeff, a lot of the volume growth in the quarter was driven by markets outside of the U.S. Specifically, China had a very good quarter. And as we've talked before, the growth in China has been in the segment of the market that's lower-priced paints. So the translation from volume to sales dollar growth is a little lower in China. We have the opposite of that going on in the U.S. market with the introduction of branded paints in the hardware channel and the Valspar Reserve at Lowe's. The mix of our business allows us to grow top line sales a little bit more than volume. But the short answer is significant growth in the China market.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So in other words, you had a mix issue in the quarter, it wasn't simply marketing expense?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, 2 different things, Jeff. I wouldn't call it a mix issue. We're talking about the volume growth in the China business going up commensurate with the strategy that we have in place for that market. Separate and aside, from an expense standpoint, our expense growth has been focused on the investments we're making to support volume growth in both the U.S. and Europe. So I don't look at those as a mix issue, I look at those as investments in growing both of those regional markets.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "So your receivables were $871 million versus $716 million in the year ago. Why are the receivables so high? And why is your working capital becoming so heavy?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. Our working capital is up primarily due to the investments that we've made to increase inventory associated in the new launches around Ace. But also recall that a portion of that inventory build, probably the biggest part of the inventory build year-over-year, is the Inver business, so really not a build, just not in the comparable numbers from last year yet. If you go back to last quarter, we finished Q2 with inventories up roughly 15%. Or as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, inventories now are up a little over 26%. Biggest increase between Q2 and Q3 has really been inventory we've been building to support the growth we've seen in the Packaging business and some of the improved performance we're seeing in the General Industrial markets.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "But what about the receivables?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Receivables primarily relates to the timing of sales in our Packaging business and the agreements that we have with vendors and the sales in the U.S. market around paints. I think the best way to look at this, Jeff, is when we anniversary and we get into the fourth quarter and we look at the kind of a full year-end balances, we expect more normalized behavior. We've just got a bunch of new product launches that have happened in Q2 and Q3 that are changing our timing a little bit within the year. Nothing fundamentally has changed with our payment terms to individuals or our receipt terms from our customer bases by segment.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How much did product load-in related to your initiative contribute in the U.S. business during the quarter? And why was there such a big disconnect in performance between Valspar and the peer group business that sell-in to the big-box retailers?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, 2 things. First off, I would not say that we experienced a load-in, in the third quarter at all. Basically, our sales volume was highest in the U.S. business during the second quarter in advance of the paint season. So the additional inventory -- or sorry, the additional shipments we talked about in our prepared remarks were really in Q2. And then to answer the second part of your question, I would not say that our sales of paint in the U.S. market were lower than our competitors. I think what you're compared potentially is information that's presented based on end sales to customers with our competitors. Recall, our business is sold through retailers. So there, we pool [ph] our sales numbers are shipments into retailers versus some of our competitors who are reporting direct sales results to customers. But we absolutely see that our results in the U.S. have been very good during paint season.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes. I think back to -- this is Gary. I'd go back to the comments I made in my script. If you put Q2 and Q3 together, our sales were up double-digits and our volume was up mid-single-digits. And as I said, I'm not going to call out the exact sell-through of Valspar Paints at retail. But I would say that we're satisfied with the sell-through as well.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. Just a related question, apart from new products, are you guys maintaining share at your largest customer?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, absolutely.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, on raw materials, some prices in epoxies and other resins seemed to be going up. So can you comment on that? And then the question on TiO2, do you see any chance of a price increase in this calendar year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "It's Gary, P.J. So our raw material basket in the quarter was relatively flat, I will say that we have seen in our China business some early signs of modest inflation. But with respect to answering questions about specific commodities, we got out of that business a long time ago when we got tired of answering the TiO2 questions. So I can't help you. The bottom line is I can't help you on individual commodities.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And let me ask you on pricing. In the U.S., how much were prices are up in Paints year-over-year? And as you sell more volumes through Ace, how will it impact your price mix in the U.S.?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Okay. Well, in terms of pricing, I think pricing in the channels that we serve has been pretty steady. I think there had been price increases in the stores channel, which we all participate in. But so that's the answer to your first question. The answer to your second question is as we continue to be successful with Reserve and the branded paint initiatives at Lowe's, we expect our mix will shift in a positive direction. And we actually see that in our results.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I mean, my question was is Ace pricing point lower than Lowe's pricing point?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "No, they're always going to be higher.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Gary, could you just discuss China Coatings, how those markets are progressing, off-road, Wood, et cetera?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, David, we've had a very good year in China. Our overall business is up in the mid-teens. It was in the quarter and it has been for the full year. And all of our businesses in China have contributed more or less at the same level. So just as a reminder of the businesses that are significant to us in China, it's our consumer business, it's the Wood coatings business, it's our Packaging coatings business and the 2 industrial businesses that we call out in terms of product lines, are Coil and General Industrial. All of the businesses in China this year have had a positive year. So one, just 1 thing to think about, last year was a relatively weak year for us in China. It's was one of the contributors to the results that we had last year, which didn't meet our expectations. Our businesses have come back this year. The markets have recovered, I would say, modestly. But we've done a very good job in executing and taking share. We're a small player in every market that we participate in, in China. And we've done a nice job of taking share.", "David L. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Very good. And just in the U.S., Gary, how would you characterize this U.S. paint season: normal, above normal, below normal? What would you say?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I'd say it's near normal. With the internal research that we -- just in terms of our sell-through, as I've said, we've been pleased with the sell-through of Valspar Paints at retail. That's 1 indicator. And then our research, our internal research says that people, consumers in the U.S. are thinking about painting projects in more or less the way they have historically in terms of when they're going to do it and why they do it, et cetera, so normal is what I -- is the short answer.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "The question I have is regarding the Ace business. When you acquired the business, it was sort of a breakeven-type of an operation. And then just thinking was that by the end of this year, it's going to get to the high single-digits as you close a couple of plants. Sort of where you versus your expectations?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We're more or less in line with what we expected. You're talking about the private-label piece, Dmitry?", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Correct, the private label.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "There are 2 parts. There's a branded piece, which is incremental business for us. And then there's a private-label piece, which we acquired and we lost money on for last year and in the first part of this year. But that's a business that we have a contract on a cost-plus basis and we had to close a couple of factories in North America to get to the terminal cost structure that we committed to. We closed those factories, and now we're operating it as it should.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So I know you don't like to talk about 2015 expectations yet. But as we play with our models and as you look into 2015, that roughly $100 million business is going bring in margin this time around.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, but not a ton, right, cost plus.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Second question is your debt continues to climb. And I know typically, as with your inventories, you build them during the winter months, and then you sort of liquidate them into the summer months, this year being different because of the new programs you're rolling out. Can you talk a little bit about what your debt strategy is and sort of where you're comfortable with the debt level? Are there plans to take the debt down materially? Or should we think about it basically staying at these levels, and then you utilizing your free cash for share repurchase and acquisitions?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, Dmitry, it's Jim. Our priority is obviously from a cash flow standpoint is to take the cash that we're generating from operations that we continue to expect to increase as we grow the initiatives both in the Paints and Coatings segments and deploy that first against good capital ideas against our portfolio, whether it's adding new production or improving productivity. Certainly, from that standpoint, as we've done the last couple years, using cash flow to make acquisitions that make strategic sense for the company. We're not in the business to hoard cash for our shareholders. We've got a nice balanced portfolio of enhancing returns through share repurchases as well. So really I look at the leverage we have on the businesses as appropriate and modest. We've got capacity to do more from a leverage standpoint if an M&A opportunity comes along that makes sense to us. We also have the opportunity to issue a little bit more debt to continue to fund the business and continue to fund share repurchases going forward. So we're really looking at it from a debt strategy standpoint. We've got plenty of capacity to do the things that we need to do to grow the business organically. And we're in position if we need to increase leverage a little bit for an M&A opportunity overall.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And then just final question, I want to make sure I have my math right in sort of putting together some of the things you've talked about. The incremental SG&A expense of $40 million quarter-over-quarter, you talked about half of that or maybe about $20 million being the advertising and marketing expense, mostly tied to the Paints business, I would assume. Without that incremental expense, would it be fair to say that your Paints operating profits would have been up about $10 million?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. I mean, we could have driven higher operating income if we weren't making those investments for the business. What I want to call out specifically, Dmitry, is that you can't look at -- well, our intent isn't to say that 100% of those incremental expenses are one-time in nature and are not going to recur next year. A portion of those expenses that I called out in my prepared remarks are ongoing support costs for the business. And we'll absolutely have opportunities to continue to support the growth in those businesses next year. But to the point that Gary made, we expect to grow volumes in the Paints segment next year and we expect to get better operating margins by leveraging those investments as we have a full year behind us in those initiatives and as we continue to see growth in both the big box and in the hardware channel in the U.S.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Yes. Just a follow-up on the SG&A, so as we look at the balance of this year, again you're up $40 million year-over-year. Does the variable IC -- of $8 million kind of -- does that become flat year-over-year? And with the promotional expense of around $20 million, would that kind of fall in half on a year-over-year basis in the fiscal fourth quarter?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. So I'm not going to talk about specific components of what's going to drive SG&A. But from a macro standpoint, similar to what I've been saying earlier, our expense growth in Q4 is expected to be less than what we've experienced during the last 2 quarters. We are going to have a little less pressure on variable bonuses, given the activity and turnback we had to do last year based on the performance of the business. But that will be contingent upon where we finish the year. Certainly, our incentive bonuses will be set based on our final year-end performance, and we'll do any true-ups we need to do in the fourth quarter. Coming out of the key element of paint season, just our year-over-year increases in spending in that segment are expected to come down in the fourth quarter from what we experienced in Q3 and Q2.", "Donald Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then you mentioned that you thought your sales or volumes were up mid-single-digits, which you thought was in line with the market. What's your overall expectation of the market this year versus last, given the slowdown that we're seeing in some key housing metrics, like home turnover and new residential construction?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. I mean, we have a pretty, I think, balanced view of the full year from a housing standpoint when we started. We certainly saw that there'd be continued tailwinds around the recovery of the market. But we did not set an overly optimistic view of where housing was going to go. Quite candidly, our focus this year has been on launching new products and executing in the home improvement channel, which we believe has been very successful, and expanding some very significant and important new distribution in the hardware channel. So while the underlying housing trends may have softened a little bit, our view for the year started off, I think, as kind of down in the middle of the fairway. And secondly, we've been executing really hard on some new growth initiatives. So our results are probably more akin to that this year versus the market than any specific changes in the market.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "I was wondering, it sounds like in Australia, your volumes, I think you called out about high single or double-digit-type volume growth in Australia. So wondering, how does that compare to the market over there? Do you continue to gain share? And also how is your margin profile going over there? I know there's been a lot of restructuring over the past couple years. So are you starting to see now that you're getting that volume, a nice pickup in margin as well?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes. Kevin, it's Gary. So yes, it was a great quarter for that business. And it did translate into improved earnings. That's a leverage, to some extent, a leverage play now. We've done our restructuring. We've got the cost structure that we want. And incremental volume is very profitable volume for us. So that's the second question that you asked. The first question is we took share again this quarter in both trade and at retail. And that is fundamentally the reason that we got the nice growth that we did.", "Kevin Hocevar - Northcoast Research", "And you called out at least all the major product lines within the General Industrial were improving. I was wondering if shipping container, if -- I know that's been beaten down for a while, if you're starting to see that turn as well. And if this agreement that you had with Maersk, I know you announced a couple quarters ago, if you're starting to see some new business opportunities as a result of that as well.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "So we saw what I would call a very modest increase in shipping container construction in the quarter for our legacy business. It didn't move the dial in terms of our overall results, but it was positive. And then the Maersk partnership has been very good. We're selling our product to Maersk. We're making containers and that's a significant change in the industry. Obviously, it's new sales for us, but it's also -- they're also a reference customer for that industry. And for Maersk to convert from a solid-based coating to a water-based coating bodes well for the sustainability of that industry and it bodes well for us as a first mover. So no great improvement in the market yet, but our business is doing just fine.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "We're seeing some channel checks about your efforts at being cute that suggested you might actually be gaining more shelf space in some of the stores than you had initially targeted. Can you comment on that at all?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "I don't know, Vincent. I'm not trying to be evasive. I'm not exactly sure what you're talking about. Our program, as it's set, has been pretty consistent with the planograms that we established right in the beginning of the program. So I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about. I will say this, sell-through of Valspar has been really good. We're very pleased with it. And I think our retail partner is very pleased with it. The best is yet to come with B&Q. We've got 250 stores, roughly 250 stores set with about 100 left to go. The 100 remaining are the ones that really drive the volume in the business. They're the large format stores, B&Q has 3 formats. So we're just now in the process of setting the large format stores. And that'll take place over the next few months. So yes, it's gone a little bit slower than we expected just in terms of the overall program, where there's more complexity in the big format stores than we anticipated. But sell-through of Valspar and consumer acceptance and desire to buy Valspar Paint has been very strong.", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes. And we're looking forward to the day when we can turn advertising on effectively in the marketplace. And to your point, Vincent, our presence in the stores is strong and noticeable for customers. It's not a value proposition that's tucked away in the department. It is something that stands out as new and big in the portfolio, so we're quite excited to see how it develops.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just to be clear, maybe I wasn't clear. The feedback we were getting was that it was going very well and was doing better than expected, and the retailer was quite pleased with it obviously. The rest of my questions have been answered, so I'll pass along.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.", "Most of my questions have been answered. But I was wondering if you could give us a feel for the success of Valspar Reserve. We are now at the end of the season. Did you sell or did Lowe's sell as much as you anticipated?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "It exceeded our expectations. I won't comment on Lowe's. But it definitely exceeded Valspar's expectations. The penetration into our overall mix has been higher than we planned. Consumer acceptance has been phenomenal. The basic thing that we set out to do was to provide consumers with an exceptional paint, better than the product that we had at the top end, more features and attributes. We thought we could convince the Lowe's associates in store that consumers would pay up for that price point. And all of that has proven to be true. So we couldn't be more pleased with both the execution of the launch and consumer acceptance of the product.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.", "Well, that is great. And, Gary, looking at Europe, other companies have said that while certain areas were growing, like automotive, construction was still in the doldrums and, in some cases, still declining. Could you give us a better feel as to where you are doing so much better in Europe besides Packaging?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "All of our businesses' product lines in the quarter and the year, Rosemarie, have performed better than last year. So Packaging has performed particularly well. But our General Industrial business is doing well. I mean, big news there this year was Inver and the integration of our legacy business into Inver. That's been substantially completed and has been a success for us. Our Coil business has improved pretty substantially in the year. And we've improved distribution in other parts of our Europe, Middle East and Africa region, particularly the Middle East, where our business in the Middle East has been stronger this year. So it's been a very positive year for our team in Europe.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.", "Gary, any particular end markets that are doing better than others? I mean, so the Coil, for example, where is it going?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Let's just call it pan-Europe.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - G. Research, Inc.", "All right. Well, I meant end product, refrigerators versus something else that I cannot think of.", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "No. I mean, I can't give you that. I'd hate to speculate on that, Rosemarie. Our Coil business is mainly building products. So that would be the end market. But for us it's been about taking market share as much as it is about the overall market. In General Industrial, we're still a small player even after the Inver integration. We're certainly not 10% of the overall market. We're probably closer to 5% in industrial coatings. So we've got lots of opportunities to grow even if the market is not growing. That's the way we look at our business in Europe. We look at our business that way in Latin America. And we look at our business that way in Asia.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Strong results in Australia notwithstanding one of your partners there, Masters, seems to be having some difficulty with its store growth and revenue growth. Would you help us understand how the split is between your strong growth, I guess, in Wattyl as well as Masters versus what we're seeing in terms of on the Masters' side not really growing at all?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes. I'm not going to comment on Masters. That would be a question that you'd have to ask them. They have 50 stores. They expect to build 10 to 15 stores over the next few years. All of those stores will require paint. I think the paint department within Masters is performing pretty well. And Masters is still a relatively small portion of our overall portfolio in our Australia business. If you recall, Nils, about 2/3 of our businesses is trade business, about 1/3 is retail. And we have distribution that is not Masters distribution. So 50 stores, 10 to 15 a year, that gets them close to 100 stores in a few years. And that's nice business.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "No, that's helpful. I know you said that your non-BPA offering was pretty small. But as it gets bigger and there's more interest in it in Europe, in the U.S. and perhaps at some point in Asia, is there going to be a meaningful mix uplift from that offering just on pricing or margin?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We're not going to commit to that. Our job is to grow our business and we're going to -- we have a very significant opportunity to grow our business in Europe, in Latin America and in Asia, where our share, percentage of market, is much lower than it is in North America. And so we're focused on growth, and it is a profitable segment for us. So if we get market-average margins and we're growing, then our investors will be satisfied with that outcome.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Got it, understood. And then just finally, I know you said that in Coatings, pretty much all lines had saw growth, didn't call out anything on the off-road or machinery, which had been an issue in the past. Has that corrected itself fully? And are we going to start seeing positive comps anytime soon?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "Yes, I think we're just trying to get away from, to the extent that we can, talking about the subsegments within GI. So the way our Coatings segment is organized, it's Packaging coatings, Coil coatings, General Industrial coatings and Wood coatings. And when we disappointed ourselves last year, we were pretty specific as to the product lines within our portfolio that hurt us. We like to try not to continue referencing back to those product lines all the time and would rather talk about the main product line within the segment, which would be General Industrial. So I'll say this, within the General Industrial product line in our Coatings segment, every one of those end markets improved at least modestly in the quarter. So I'll answer your specific question, and hopefully this will be the last time I answer it on a call. We took a lot of market share in China. And that's been part of the improvement. And I would say that the overall growth of that segment, you'd be better served reading the earnings transcripts from Caterpillar and Deere, who are the market leaders in that segment. They would be able to tell you with more precision than we can how the overall market is performing.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Schwartz with First Analysis.", "Steven Schwartz - First Analysis Securities Corporation, Research Division", "Gary, in your prepared remarks, when you talked about the EBIT margin for Paint and you compared second quarter and third quarter, you noted that you shipped more of the Reserve in the second quarter. And you'd expect that, that would help overhead absorption. But I'm not quite sure how that reduces or negatively impacts margin in the third quarter unless there's some cannibalization. Am I reading that wrong or hearing it wrong?", "James L. Muehlbauer", "Yes, 2 things in that, Steve. First off, I think in Gary's remarks, he was referring to volume and sales and not EBIT between the quarters. But to maybe just rewind a little bit, the volume growth we had in the U.S. in the second quarter was comprised of certainly kind of our base recurring businesses but also supporting the launch of Valspar Reserve and the Ace branded sets for Valspar Paints. So as we moved into Q3, we increased spending along both initiative lines. But part of the volume that was actually sold in Q3 by our retail customers, we had actually sold into the channel during Q2 before the start of the season. So what we were trying to provide transparency in explaining is you really need to put the 2 quarters together to look at the performance of the Paints segment. The traction that we're seeing with Valspar Reserve per Gary's comments and what we're seeing in overall offtake is in line with what we expected for the total season so far. Our EBIT, being flat in Paints year-to-date, is a product of the top line growth we're driving to those new business initiatives plus expenses we need to do to support the business in the near term that we know we can leverage more fully going forward.", "Operator", "And our last question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Neal P. Sangani - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Neal Sangani with the follow-up. It sounds like the B&Q rollout is going very well. Have you figured out or how are you looking at your long-term supply plan for the region?", "Gary E. Hendrickson", "We're going to supply from Europe, Neal. It's just a question of getting the right structure in place. And we're talking with multiple parties that are interested in partnering with us, and we've -- our team knows that next year, we expect -- I expect that we're going to be supplying B&Q from Europe. And our team will make that happen.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this conference will be made available for replay after 12:30 today, running through Tuesday, August 26 at midnight.

We're going to begin the call this morning with some prepared remarks by John Morikis, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Chris Connor, Chairman and CEO.

Morikis", "Thanks, Bob. Third quarter 2014 was another strong quarter for the company. But before we go through our results in more detail, I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some key organizational changes we made during the past 3 months.", "Let me begin by saying that none of these changes will affect the composition of our reportable segments for the third quarter or in future reporting periods.", "For the past 4 years, Jay Davisson has provided outstanding leadership to our North American Paint Stores organization, overseeing a period of impressive growth and expansion. In August of this year, we broadened Jay's responsibilities to include the distribution of our products through Latin America. In this new capacity, Jay and his team will be charged with growing our business across North and South America, providing integrated resources to support our sales and marketing efforts. To support this effort, the R&D teams and labs located in Latin America region will become part of the global supply chain R&D organization. This will result in faster technology transfer and new product development across multiple product portfolios.", "Pablo Garcia Casas, Formally President and General Manager of Sherwin-Williams Mexico, has been promoted to President and General Manager, Latin America division, reporting to Jay. Again, none of these organizational changes affect our reportable segments for our third quarter or in future periods, nor do they affect our leadership or organizational structure of the Paint Stores Group in North America. Our goal is to promote collaboration in the sharing of resources between our North American and Latin American business units to accelerate growth across both regions.", "In the third quarter, we continued to see strong momentum in both of our domestic businesses -- in both our domestic businesses and mixed results from our nondomestic operations. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for our third quarter 2014 compared to third quarter 2013, then comment on each reportable segment.", "Consolidated net sales increased 10.6% to $3.15 billion, driven primarily by strong performance in our stores group and acquisitions. The Comex acquisition added 3.3% to net sales in the quarter, while unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 0.7%. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $175 million year-over-year to $1.47 billion, and gross margin increased 120 basis points to 46.7% of sales from 45% in the third quarter last year. This was -- margin improvement was primarily the result of better operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume, which more than offset the anticipated gross margin drag from the stores acquired from Comex.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $94.7 million to $984.4 million. As a percent of sales, third quarter SG&A was flat year-over-year at 31.2%, reflecting a decline in core SG&A as a percent of sales, plus the incremental SG&A from acquisitions.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $16 million, an increase of $631,000 over third quarter last year.", "Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $86.6 million or 22.3% to $474 million. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year was 31.2%, compared to 32.1% in the third quarter of 2013. For the full year 2014, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low-30s compared to last year's rate of 30.7%. Consolidated net income increased $63.3 million or 24.1% to $326.2 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 10.4% compared to 9.2% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 31.4% to $3.35 per share, compared to $2.55 per share in the third quarter 2013. The combination of acquisitions and currency decreased earnings per share $0.04 in the quarter.", "Now looking at our results by operating segment. Paint Stores Group turned in another strong performance in the third quarter. Segment sales increased 15% to $2.03 billion. And comparable store sales, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months, grew 9.6%. This comp store revenue growth includes almost no effective pricing and no contribution from the Comex stores. So core store volume growth was solidly in the high-single digits.", "Acquisitions added $80.4 million or 4.6% to sales in the quarter. Regionally, in the third quarter, our Southwestern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division and Eastern Division.", "Paint Stores Group's segment profit for the quarter increased $72.5 million or 20.2% to $431.8 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased to 21.3% from 20.4% last year, as higher paint sales volumes were more than enough to overcome a $5.4 million loss on the acquired stores. During the quarter, we added 18 net new stores, bringing our year-to-date total to 51 new locations. At quarter end, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean was 3,959, compared to 3,868 locations at the end of the third quarter 2013.", "Our Paint Stores Group plans to add approximately 80 to 90 net new store locations during calendar year 2014. The integration of the stores we acquired from Comex a year ago is proceeding according to plan with some consolidation costs coming in below what we originally expected.", "For our Consumer Group, organic sales growth slowed somewhat in the third quarter, but segment operating margins held up well. Sales increased 5% to $385.2 million from $366.8 million last year with acquisitions adding 3.9% to net sales in the quarter. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $5.9 million or 8.1% to $79 million from $73.1 million last year. Acquisitions decreased segment profit $1.9 million in the quarter, as a result of strong seasonality in some of the acquired businesses.", "Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 20.5% from 19.9% in the same period last year. For the second consecutive quarter, Global Finishes Group generated revenue growth in the mid-single digits and made progress on operating margin. Third quarter sales in U.S. dollars increased 5.7% to $536.3 million, driven by higher paint sales volumes and selling price increases.", "Unfavorable currency translation decreased sales 0.4% in the quarter compared to last year. Global Finishes group's domestic business continued to show strength in the third quarter, but this improvement was partially offset by weakness outside of the U.S., particularly in Latin America. Segment profit, in U.S. dollars, increased 36.4% in the quarter to $60.8 million from $44.5 million last year, due primarily to higher paint sales volumes and price increases. These results also include a $6.3 million gain on the early termination of a customer agreement in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes reduced segment profit $900,000.", "As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group's segment profit was 11.3% in the quarter compared to 8.8% last year. Our Latin America Coatings Group continues to operate in a very challenging economic environment. Third quarter net sales for the group stated in U.S. dollars, decreased 4% to $200.4 million. Volumes in the quarter were negative and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 7.8%, both of which were offset to some degree by selling price increases.", "Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, increased to $11.8 million from a loss of $1 million in the same period last year. In the third quarter 2013, we incurred a charge of $19.8 million related to a Brazil tax assessment. This year, lower sales volumes, currency-related raw material cost inflation and unfavorable currency translation were only partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased segment profit $4 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 5.9% in the quarter, compared to negative 0.5% in the third quarter 2013.", "This concludes our review of results for the quarter. So I'll turn the call over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. Chris?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, John. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today. There is not much I need to add to John's comments on our third quarter results other than we remain convinced this positive momentum is sustainable. Regardless of the financial market's ongoing concerns over the resilience of the domestic housing recovery, if and when the nonres rebound will materialize or whether the job market can sustain all this, we see an increasingly positive picture developing for our company.", "Home prices are still rising at a healthy yet manageable pace and mortgage availability has improved. At the same time, rates are dropping. Remodeling activity has picked up in terms of both current projects and contractor sentiment. New square footage growth is positive year-to-date in both the residential and nonresidential markets.", "In cities across America, occupancy rates in multifamily housing, office space, hospitality, manufacturing and warehouses have reached very healthy levels, a really good bellwether of future demand for new commercial space. And many of the industrial coatings markets have turned the corner and are showing increasing strength. This positive momentum has been evident in our sales and earnings performance going back to the second quarter last year.", "The results we released this morning set new all-time records for consolidated sales, operating margins, net income and earnings per share for any quarter in our company's history.", "It was also a record quarter in terms of net operating cash generation. Working capital management continues to be a source of operating cash for the company, particularly as we integrate the operations of the Comex business we acquired 1 year ago. These efforts have driven our working capital ratio down 170 basis points year-over-year to 10.8% of sales, compared to 12.5% on September 30 last year. 9-month net operating cash increased more than $100 million compared to the same period last year and stands at just over 10% of sales. In the third quarter alone, we generated $550 million in net operating cash, bringing our 9 month total to $881.3 million. Free cash flow, which to us is net operating cash, less CapEx and dividends, was $583 million. We continue to invest a portion of the company's cash back into the business in the form of capital expenditures. For the first 9 months of 2014, we spent $136 million on CapEx, depreciation expense was $125.7 million and amortization expense was $22.6 million. For the full year 2014, we anticipate CapEx spending will be in the range of $170 million to $180 million. Depreciation will be about $170 million, and amortization will be about $30 million.", "In the third quarter, we bought back 2 million shares of our common stock in the open market, bringing our year-to-date total purchases to 5.33 million shares at an average price of $2.05, I'm sorry, $205.46. On September 30, we have remaining authorization to acquire 6.8 million shares. Last week, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share, up from $0.50 last year.", "Before I turn to our expectations for the balance of the year, I want to comment briefly on the organization changes John highlighted at the beginning of the call. Needless to say, for the past 2 years, we've faced very difficult market conditions in Latin America.", "Our management team and all of our people throughout the region responded with intelligence, hard work and determination. I'm pleased with their response, and confident in their future. The actions we've taken to promote closer collaboration between our North American and Latin American businesses is not a reaction to the current economic environment, rather it's an important step towards our long-term goal to be the market leader in architectural and protective coatings throughout the Americas.", "For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our consolidated net sales will increase 6% to 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. With revenues at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.40 per share, compared to $1.14 per share in the fourth quarter of 2013.", "This guidance includes our expectation that the Comex acquisition will reduce diluted net income per common share by approximately $0.10 in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2014, we expect consolidated net sales to increase 9% to 11% compared to full year 2013.", "With annual sales at that level, we have raised our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to a range of $8.70 to $8.80 per share, compared to $7.26 per share earned in 2013. This annual guidance includes $0.28 per share EPS dilution, which is lower than both our original full year expectation of $0.50 dilution and a revised second quarter expectation of $0.35 per share dilution from the Comex acquisition.", "Again, thanks to all of you for joining us this morning. And now, we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Just first off on the customer termination you referenced for Global Finishes. Does that impact the top line at all going forward? And is the gain just specific to the third quarter or is there any sort of residual flow-through into 4Q as well?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, the fourth quarter, no. There's no residual into the fourth quarter. I would say there's going to be a small amount of residual sales decrease in the future, but not enough to be material.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And then just in terms of the comp store sales for Paint Stores going forward. I mean, obviously, you're starting to cycle through some very, very tough comparisons as you did in 3Q. Can you just, sort of, give us an early glimpse into what a realistic growth rate is for you versus the industry in 2015? I know it's a little bit early, but I thought I'd ask anyway.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Ghansham. So we'll give you a lot more color on that, obviously, when we have our year end call and give your our guidance for next year. I think we've been commenting for some time now to the investment community that our expectations is that stores group can perform at 1.5x to 2x the market based on the rebounding contractor segments that we've talked about. So if we think that the market will continue to be a little bit ahead of GDP growth next year, let's say, the 3% to 4%, we would expect our volumes in that stores group to outperform.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Could you -- it sounds like Comex continues to come in better than you expected. Do you have an update on when you expect the stores in total to become completely accretive rather than dilutive?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, we sure do. This is Sean Hennessy. And again, we're giving you guidance of $0.28 loss this year. And we've been consistent in the last few quarters saying that we're going to actually earn $0.08 to $0.13 next year. So we believe that next year, we're going to have $0.36 to $0.41 accretion. And we've given you EPS guidance there. So we think next year, we're going to have positive operating profits.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "But you're not pulling that forward to slightly better performance in the last couple of quarters.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No. And here's why. When you take a look at the difference between the $0.35 and the $0.28, this is really driven by -- it's really driven by closing costs. Closing costs have come in less than we thought. So operationally, we think we're pretty much in the same situation we were. The $0.06 that we did take this quarter, we did anticipate it in our full year guidance of $0.35. We did anticipate it in the fourth quarter, not the third quarter. But for the full year, we did anticipate that $0.06. So the difference between $0.35 and $0.28 is really closing costs.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "A question on Comex about -- I know they're not in the same-store sales. But can you tell us about how those stores are performing on a year-over-year basis? I ask because seasonally it looks like your sales in Comex went down 22% from the second quarter, whereas your regular Sherwin stores went up 9%. And I just don't know why they behave so different on a seasonal basis.", "John G. Morikis", "Yes. So if you look at that performance over the past 12 months, we've had revenues through those stores of $425 million. And that is down slightly year-over-year. As we took that business over, those stores were under pressure, and they had sales that were going backwards. We've since stabilized that business, and we're feeling good about where that business is going, and we expect that those stores will perform much better going forward. We do expect that they'll lag our comp Sherwin stores in performance, but they'll continue to get better in their performance.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "We also believe that because as the integration continues to be completed, breaking the sales out and then going forward, really it's going to be a difficult, if that's possible. So this would probably be the last quarter that we're able to give you Comex sales. Because as the integration occurs, the sales go from one store to another.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "But suffice to say that if your normal business drops off in Q3 to Q4, I assume we should expect that the Comex sales would also seasonally drop? And then I'll leave that one alone.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Sure, of course.", "John G. Morikis", "Yes.", "Christopher M. Connor", "One point to add to the Comex story Aram, is that we've closed 7 Comex stores this year as well. Or the other side of the business, obviously, we continue to add stores.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "Okay. And then I'm sure the question will be asked. But oil prices have obviously gone through the floor and that must have had some change on your input price outlook. I'm just hoping you can update us and remind us again kind of what percent of your inputs are oil-based and how we should think about that for 2015?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, Aram this is Bob. It is certainly true that a portion of our raw material basket is sensitive to crude oil pricing. About 10 years ago, we did an analysis that told us that a 10% move in crude oil would result in just under a 1% move in the raw material basket. Since that time, we haven't updated that analysis. But since that time, our raw material basket has become less oil sensitive, primarily in the solvent category and resin category. So a 10% move in crude oil today would result in something less than 0.9% move into raw material basket. There will be some benefit, but it won't really be material.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Several companies that have reported so far have talked about signs of commercial growth. You have a pretty good exposure to that through your stores business. So what kind of opportunity do you see in 2015 from commercial construction?", "Robert J. Wells", "P.J., this is Bob again. We feel very good about the direction and kind of the momentum in the nonresidential market. And our optimism is fueled by 2 sources of information. One is the same published data sources that everyone else is looking at. And that shows contracts for new addition and major alterations up very significantly in a lot of the categories that Chris mentioned in his opening remarks. Office and bank buildings up more than 25%. Hotels and motels up almost 50% year-over-year. Manufacturing and schools and colleges in the mid-teens. And those categories, all told, represent almost 40% of the nonresidential space. There are some negative categories, retail and health care and managed care being kind of standing out amongst the negatives. But overall, square footage contracted year-to-date is up 5%. We also get timely robust feedback from our contractor customers. Many of them who specialize in this commercial space. And clearly, they are busier and more optimistic today than they were a year ago.", "P. J. Juvekar - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And just quickly on M&A pipeline. Chris, you talked about in the past, making strategic acquisitions in Asia and Europe. And I know, at some point, you'd said that valuations were high in Asia. So what do you see there now?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think we've been consistent, P.J. Our interest in Asia and Europe would be to continuing the support our industrial coatings businesses, which we would embed in that global group. I don't think these evaluations particularly are out of line for us. Ours is just a much more thoughtful process at looking for the right technologies in the right end customer segments. Coupled with that will be our continued focus on architectural opportunities throughout the Americas. And obviously, in Latin America, plenty of opportunities. So we continue to stay diligent in those 2 areas and keep The Street posted whenever we have something to share with you.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "With regard to cash flow, you pushed the working capital levels to some pretty aggressively really kind of squeezing a lot or wringing a lot out of rag. I guess, I'm wondering how much, now that we're kind of anniversary a lot of the Comex moves or initial moves, I guess, how should we think about the ability to wring more out of the working capital rag going forward?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "One of the things that we always are conscious of as we go through these inventory analysis, as we're looking at that service. And what's interesting is that service is actually higher today than it was when we were at 15%, 18% working capital. What we've said is we used just to talk about 11% of sales would be normal. I think our goal now is 10%. We think that will continue to work, especially some of the changes we've made in Latin America and so forth, we think that we can run this company at 10% working capital to sales and still have higher service to our customers.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. We don't like your word squeeze, John. It's basically [ph] running -- 15% is better.", "John G. Morikis", "I would say that the commercial teams are thrilled with the service levels and we're operating at a very good place right now.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And then one last question. With regard to, I guess, the administrative line or the corporate line, there was a tick up on the provision for environmental. It jumped up $11 million. And so can you just remind us of what that is and how we should be thinking about that expense maybe going forward?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Good question. If you look at our footnote that we've continued to put in our Q and the K, these are historical sites, manufacturing sites. And the ongoing expenses are booked when specific remediation plans are approved. And really trying to predict the timing that -- of the approvals with the government agencies is very difficult even while we're working with those agencies. So in the quarter, we have a little more agreement that what we're going to do in a site. And if you look at -- we talked about the Gibbsboro site in our footnote, and I think that's where we're at, and which is why the -- but this -- the work that we've done this quarter, that's why the expense was higher. And that was higher than we expected. That was probably $8 million to $10 million higher than expected. That was not in our guidance for the quarter. So we were surprised of the timing also John.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And that goes back down to normal now that we're -- now that it's been announced and it's kind of run through your channel, is that the right way to think about it?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. And if you look at it, our admin expense was negatively affected by $11 million in the quarter, $9 million year-to-date. So it's really that timing. It's definitely what some timing now.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "There's a new chloride-based large TiO2 plant being built in China or coming onstream in China from Henan Billions. Are you familiar with the technology in that plant? And is it feasible for Sherwin-Williams to import TiO2 from China that's chloride-based for its global operations?", "Robert J. Wells", "Jeff, this is Bob. We are familiar with that technology. We understand it to be not as productive a technology as some out there, but it's going to produce high-quality chloride TiO2. To the extent that, that chloride TiO2 comes on to the global market, we would certainly be in a position to negotiate.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Chris, I'm so surprised your letting Bob get away with a 10-year old analysis. Maybe just ask that question a little differently. If you put the whole basket together as you guys have done in the past, and everything holds where it is today, what would be your outlook over the next year, let's say, for raw material cost?", "Christopher M. Connor", "So Bob may be using 10-year-old analysis, but Hennessy uses a 148-year-old analysis. What we do here is based on history. It's a little bit early for us, Dennis, to give you comment on the basket of raws for 2015. Again, that will be a first quarter call. We hold ourselves to that discipline to advise you of that. Having said that, and with the earlier question from Aram about oil, we don't see a lot of pressure right now, but we'll give you much more definitive answer on that here in the next call.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay, fair enough. And then, John, just to clarify the accretion from Comex next year, the $0.08 to $0.13, are there any onetime items? Or is there [indiscernible] that will be included in that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No. I think that when we acquired this asset, we had 8 manufacturing sites. We've announced 5 have closed. And so we've taken the closing costs on those 5, I don't see any major changes in the next -- or hit in that analysis of $0.08 to $0.13.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. And then last question on the balance sheet. If you were not to find another acquisition over the next year, let's say that meets your criteria and the cash flow is going to remain strong, would you ever consider borrowing and levering up a little bit to accelerate share repurchases?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think we've been pretty consistent on this for greater than 10 years, David, at all 148. But we still believe that if we generate this cash, we're going to pay out dividends, invest in the business in CapEx and void of acquisitions, we think our debt's going to be in very good shape in that 1:1 in EBITDA. You'll see us buyback stock. I don't believe until we believe -- until we get the idea that we're not in a consolidating industry and things cannot happen. That's when we'll start thinking differently about that 1:1. But I don't see that happening in the next year's calendar year.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Sean, can you give me the changes in gross profit for the segments?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I can. Paint Stores Group was an increase of $137.8 million. Consumer was an increase of $14.6 million. Global Finishes Group was $14.5 million. And Latin America was up $9.8 million. And just remember now, Latin America, that's where the hit from the raw material -- issue in Brazil last year hit. That's why it's up.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Got you. And then if you look at your Latin America arm [ph] division and I know you're changing, you're making some leadership changes there. Is your strategy in that region going to change? Or is it going to -- what sort of, I guess, Jay is supposed to -- what is he deemed to do besides improve it? How is he going to go about getting that sort of the margins reversing out or gaining more share than what's been gained over the past couple of years?", "John G. Morikis", "Yes. I think it's fair to say that we built a pretty strong franchise here in North America and then we believe that these skills and expertise can and should be leveraged throughout the Americas. And so our long-term thoughts and commitments in the region haven't changed, we do believe that we can drive those margins into that 12% range. And it's going to be up to that team to really get into those markets with the local leadership, understand what's the best route to markets and leverage all the resources that we have to reach that type of a good return.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then last question. Was there any price mix of any consequence that was impacting the top line for the stores group?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No.", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, mostly volume.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Perrella with Bloomberg.", "Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the Latin American strategy there. When the downturn came in North American Paint Stores, you continued to invest. I see the LatAm stores are flattish for a while now. Is the impetus now to start to build up the stores await the recovery?", "John G. Morikis", "Well, we are committed to that region, but we're -- and we're also committed to the right strategy in region. And so, as you look by country, we'll be deciding what the best channel would be. And in some cases, it will be our stores. In others, it'll be through other channels of distribution. And the team is working very aggressively right now with the teams on the ground to assess those and we'll be going full throttle once they've defined the strategy by micromarket.", "Christopher Perrella - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "All right. And a question, the price of oil and, I guess, gas on your distribution network, is there a benefit? Or how should we think about lower gas prices for the Consumer Group and I guess, the distribution network?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I think that -- we do buy a lot of gas and when we have a lot of shipping and so forth, we'll see what that effect is. I don't really have a metric that I can give you at this time.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Here's one to think about, Chris. We talked about what it costs to get a gallon of paint delivered to shelf, 85% of that cost is raw material. You've got the variable, manufacturing cost. Fuel and transportation is a small percentage of what's left. So fuel savings on the fleet will be de minimis in the impact in earnings for us.", "Operator", "We'll move on to our next question, which is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Chris, I'm wondering if you guys have ever looked at econometric models around oil price and is there expected to be any elasticity of demand for your products as consumers get a little more fat in their wallets?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. I think the other metrics that we've been talking about, Bob,that are driving demand for our products are a lot more powerful than that. The occupancy rates that Bob referred to in the various end segments, our consumer confidence. Does oil impact that a little bit, perhaps slightly. But we would not put a lot of weight on oil prices changing the curve or demand for paint in the United States.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And given -- it sounds there is about that the relatively limited influence of oil prices on your costs. Does it have any influence on your efforts on pricing? Or do you view those as relatively independent?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. Well, it'd be just one of the many raw material input costs that go into the entire basket. We've been very clear that we price based on raw material input costs. So we've yet to make the call for next year on what the remainder of those items might be. But for right now, it seems that oil will not be a pressure point for us.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "I've got a couple of questions. Maybe a follow-up on the last one. Could you remind us, looking at history, how that price mix plays out when oil prices or raw material costs are coming down? And then I have a follow-up.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I think if you take a look at that chart that we showed you, the long-term chart of our gross margin, I believe 2006, oil went up to $140. It came back down into the $75 range. I could be wrong on that. But our gross margin the following year, even though the market was decreasing, we held that price and we hit an all-time high at that point, 46% gross margin.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Right, the gross margin went up, but what happened with the price mix per gallon? Will that come in? Or is there a lag or, how do we think of that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I would tell you that the oil going down did not have effect on the price mix.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Again, Greg, we've talked about the price mix ratio here for us has been to continue to see a demand for better quality products as labor costs continue to escalate, and that's a biggest part of this particular job. So I'm not trying to be obtuse here. That just isn't much impact on the oil price just dramatically on the way our customers act or the operating margins you're going to see for the company.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then the second question was on -- I think in the second quarter, you called out sprayer sales, that sort of stepped up to a new good level. Do you have any update on that? Has it stayed there or...", "John G. Morikis", "Yes. I think, be safe to say that they've continued at a pretty good pace.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then housekeeping one, the admin expenses, I see popped up to $109 million, up around $20 million. Was that a onetime step up, Sean? Or do we expect this level going forward or how should we think about that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. When you look at the third quarter, I think and you're right, it was up $20.8 million. And that's where the $11 million from that environmental -- that hit that was not in our guidance. So secondly was just a -- the other piece of it was higher compensation, including stock-based comp, which was up about 10. And again, that's just timing. We knew about that, but it was really that environmental that drove half of that increase in the quarter.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So fair to say $100 million would have been like the normal.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "More normal.", "Gregory S. Melich - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "More normal?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, right.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I know there's no changes to the Latin American reporting, but it sounds like it paves the way for potentially collapsing the Latin American segment and the Paint Store segments into a sort of a Pan regional segment, much like you have in the global segment. Would that make sense and provide some cost savings or why doesn't it make sense?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, how we report the segments in this particular case is historical. And I think there's very difference to those markets, so we want to continue to give that visibility to that. John made the comment about a lot of the learning and skill base programming we operate in North America, which will be moving into Latin America, that's just for those markets. So we're going to continue to run the company as efficiently as we can with an eye towards driving the most growth and share gains. And we think this is the structure that's best going to serve that. No change intended to the reporting segments for now or the short-term future.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Do you care to provide an update on how U.S. architectural gallonage is trending for this year? I think, back at your Investor Day in May, you put forth a new normal level of 760 million gallons. Just trying to get a sense of how far below that we're tracking in 2014.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we don't have good data anymore. Kevin, as you know, on that. Our expectation or sense is that through the first half of the year, we thought the market was moving at about a 3% to 4% range. Just listening to some of our other competitor's results, it may be slowing a little bit to that. Last year's gallons were 700 million with a 3% pop. If you look at 721 million gallons, so you still have 40 million below that 760 million. Hopefully, we'll have a little better data to share with you on the first quarter call what the year came in now in gallons.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's helpful, I appreciate it. And then, as a follow-up, could you comment on how your auto refinish coating sales trended relative to the Global Finishes segment as a whole?", "John G. Morikis", "In the Global Finishes Group, the strongest performing markets there were Product Finishes and Protective Marine. Automotive would have been in third position there. Domestically, they were stronger than they were internationally.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered. I guess, just a little bit on the Paint Stores Group. I mean, you guys have been trending up in the high-single digits now for several quarters. Maybe you can just help me understand why you think that should continue at that 1.5x to 2x the industry level.", "Allen J. Mistysyn", "The strategy that we have in our stores with this direct model is to get very close to these customers, build the products and services that they need. We're very aggressive in understanding the customers' need individually. And since we compete on a local basis, we have these local teams that are getting closer and closer to these customers. We're not waiting for the market to come to us, we're going to the market. And we feel as though we've got the products and services that are helping us to grow share at a faster rate than the market.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And I guess, just as the way to put that in context, I mean, relative to that 740 to 760 peak gallonage number, you're only at 700 maybe in the industry. So that is it fair to assume that your share has grown by significant measures since then?", "Allen J. Mistysyn", "Yes.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And that's just because of the -- largely because of the customer base, I guess, is what you're saying?", "Allen J. Mistysyn", "Yes, I believe so. I think we're aiming at the right targets with the compelling offer and service to provide them.", "Christopher M. Connor", "One of the charts we've used in our deck frequently, talks about where these gallons will come from as the industry moves from 700 back up to a normalized run rate. And it's going to come in the areas that are depressed and not quite there yet. New home construction, commercial construction, each tend to be very heavily skewed towards the painting contractors as opposed to any DIY participation in the rebound. And to John's point, that's where we really built the model through the Stores Group to support that customer segment. So we would expect to outperform on the rebounding portion of the gallons, just given our share position against our contractor today.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I'm sorry, just to fully understand this. So yes, I've seen those charts of the new home sales coming back, and we did have a pretty good number earlier this week or last week on new home sales for September. Existing was good. So you think you can still deliver this kind of high-single digit range even with new home sales? I guess, kind of still only in a recovery stage or...", "Christopher M. Connor", "We will give you guidance on the first quarter call. But to your point, we've sustained this now for multiple quarters over a couple of years. And we're still kind of -- to use -- since we're in the World Series time, a baseball vernacular, this recovery feels like it's the bottom of the third or fourth inning to us right now. So there's a little bit of a runway yet here. And we think we're in good position to capitalize on it.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Most of my questions have been answered, but I'd like to follow-up on a couple of things. First of all, back in your Investor Day, you've given the presentation on the Consumer Group, there were some hints that you guys are working on some programs. Perhaps, to get into various distribution channels. Is there any updates there? Should we be expecting something from the Consumer Group besides the programs that you already have and the products that you already supplied to various distribution channels?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, here again, Dmitry, we've been very consistent on this messaging point with the investment community. We've been working on expanding our Consumer Group business forever. And we've always been clear that we are willing to sell into these channels with the great platform of brands we have. The real opportunity would be on our architectural paint program in one of the big box players. And we just have been clear about our unwillingness to put the Sherwin-Williams contractor program brands into those platforms. But fairly now we've always believe we have an awful lot to offer. So those efforts continue as they have for some period of time. And if anything ever changes, you'll be among the first to know.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "All right, fair enough. Just a follow-up on the Consumer Group. How much of the either percentage of sales, or if you can just sort of ballpark for us sort of the size of the business, how much of that business goes into the independent retail channel? In other words, the stores that are not owned by companies and not DIY, but independent paint stores.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So all the sales in that segment are external sales, that doesn't go through any of our stores. There are some industrial coatings businesses in the aerosols, for example, that we would sell to the MRO industry. But I'm going to just guess that we're probably talking about a solid 80% of it is going into the traditional home improvement retailing channels.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "I understand that. But my question was specifically on the independent paint store channel.", "Christopher M. Connor", "A very small portion of that.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "A small portion? Okay. And then, finally, can you provide any updates, if there are any, on the what's going on with the California lead decision and where you stand on appeals and sort of what you're doing right now?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes. Dmitry, as you know, the judgment was centered against 3 of the defendant companies in the first quarter of this year. We have filed an appeal, and we filed our appeal briefs on September 16. We are now awaiting the plaintiff's response to those briefs. And once filed, we will have an opportunity to prepare responses to their briefs. And the short story is that we expect briefing to go on until year end or maybe even into first quarter '15 following which the court will schedule oral arguments. And we believe the court is likely to take through 2015 or more likely into '16 to render a decision. At that point, we believe the loser will appeal to the California Supreme Court, which is likely to take another 2 years plus.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So nothing to worry about as far as cash outlays in the major way until we get to the end of the decade at least?", "Robert J. Wells", "We have years to resolve this, yes.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "And then just -- I'm sorry to keep revisiting this unpleasantness. But any updates on the cross suits that you and Comex owners have filed against each other?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, our lawsuit in the State of New York has been stayed indefinitely, but the arbitration process is ongoing. And the timing of the arbitration is uncertain, but it is moving forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.", "Richard O'Reilly", "A couple of quick questions. When I -- when we look at the Consumer Group, the absolute profit went up $6 million or so for the quarter. But I'm surprised it's the increase in Paint Sales Stores was $250 million and the inter-segment sales for the Consumer Group was $110 million, up $110 million. I just would have thought more of a flow-through to the bottom line for the Consumer Group than the $6 million. Am I missing something there?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, the only thing you're missing is that we also had a $1.9 million loss in the Consumer Group related to the Comex acquisition. And so -- with your number, when you take a look at it, the flow-through of -- on the internal sales will change from quarter-to-quarter due to sales mix, but I think that's the only thing you're missing, quite honestly.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay. It's nothing out of the what should be -- or what would be normal for that size of the -- for the growth in retail sales?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Right. Okay. Okay. Second question is, in Latin America, you talked about increasing raw material cost. What is -- what's increasing in Latin America that's not going up in North America?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. Actually, nothing. But Latin America buys the majority of its raw materials in U.S. dollar denominations and sells the finished goods in local currency. So that devaluation is been a pretty good headwind for us in South America -- Latin America.", "Operator", "We do have a follow-up question coming from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So with regard to the Comex stores, I believe you'd indicated on prior calls that you were looking for margins to be kind of in the upper-single digits in 2015. Is that still the case? And if not, can you give us an update just to how to think about that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. And John what we tried to do because we were sort of mixing apples and oranges. And what happened there was we'd given EPS guidance for 2014. And that's why we switched the metric to the EPS for 2015, the $0.08 to $0.13 positive or $0.36 to $0.41 improvement. Operating margins are going to be positive. What happened was we originally gave a 60% of current stores, when our stores were in the 14% range. And then our stores jumped to 16%, and we're not going to be at 60% of that. And again, we're going to have margin improvement. And so that metric didn't work anymore. So we still feel pretty good about the operating margins. If you back out -- if you go up from $0.08 to $0.13, it's going to show you that we're going to have to be in the mid-single digits operating margins in the stores to hit that number.", "Operator", "It appears there are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional or concluding comments.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thanks, again, Jesse. As always, I'll be available for the balance of today, tomorrow and throughout the coming week to answer any follow-up questions you have. We want to thank you again for joining us this morning, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Seymour. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bill Seymour", "Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today, Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site at valsparglobal.com.", "And finally, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures.

Please contact us if you need further information about this event.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Today I'm going to provide highlights of our fourth quarter and full year performance. I'll also cover our outlook for 2015.", "Our strong fourth quarter capped off a record year of sales and earnings for Valspar. Net sales in the quarter increased to 11%, and adjusted EPS increased 42%.", "The Coatings segment continued its positive momentum with sales growth of 15%, and all product lines delivered increased volumes. Excluding acquisitions, coating sales were up 11%.", "In the Paints segment, sales increased in all regions, and we significantly increased EBIT. Highlighting the performance in paints was continued growth of the new Valspar Reserve premium paint, and strong growth in our international regions.", "Moving on to the full year, we grew sales 10% and EPS 23%. These record results continue to demonstrate the diversity and strength of our business portfolio. This excellent performance was driven by volume growth in the Coatings segment, continuing benefits from our new growth initiatives in paint, excellent performance from our international regions, including the successful integration of the Inver acquisition, benefits from new product introductions, and the positive impact of our productivity initiatives.", "Now, let me cover some segment-specific comment. For the year, our Coatings segment had very strong sales growth of 14% and adjusted EBIT growth of 19%. All product lines were up in sales and volumes for the year. Some highlights include the successful integration and positive performance of Inver, which gives us a solid foothold in the large industrial coatings market in Europe. We grew market share in packaging coatings, driven by our leading position in non-BPA coatings. And our coil and wood product lines benefited from improving end markets and new business wins.", "In our Paints segment, sales grew 7% and EBIT grew 11%. Highlighting the year were some significant product launches and new business wins including the highly successful launch of Valspar Reserve at Lowe's which won Lowe's Vendor Innovation of the Year award; the launch of Valspar paint in over 3200 Ace stores, and the launch of Valspar paint in over 300 B&Q stores in the U.K.", "In our international regions, our paints business had a very good year. Paints in China grew double-digits in 2014, as we continued our share growth in this key market. And our business in Australia experienced improving trends throughout the year. The fourth quarter was the fifth in a row of share gains for us in both the pro and DIY channels.", "In 2014, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns by increasing our dividend by 13% and buying back 5% of our stock, and this morning, we announced that our Board approved a 15% dividend increase for 2015, making it our 37th consecutive year of dividend growth.", "We also announced Board approval of a new $1.5 billion share repurchase authorization demonstrating our continued confidence in our business.", "Looking ahead to 2015, we expect another year of growth. In our Coatings segment, we expect relatively stable end markets and growth from business new initiatives.", "In the Paints segment, we expect that continued growth in China, Australia, and Europe will be offset by an adjustment to our product line offering at a customer in North America. We expect the revenue impact of this change to be in the range of $150 million to $180 million in fiscal 2015. This impact has been included in our 2015 guidance.", "Obviously given this headwind, we're making adjustments to our cost structure to mitigate the margin impact, and these adjustments are included in our earnings guidance.", "For some perspective on the situation, we won a lot of new paint business in North America over the years. Last year, driven by new business wins on the home improvement channel, Ace, and the independent channel, our revenue in North America was up double-digits.", "Business wins and losses are normal in the retail industry, as retailers continually adjust their product offerings. Fortunately over the years, we've won a lot more than we've lost. As to the future, our relationship with this customer remains excellent, and we expect to continue to grow our North America business from a reset base over the next few years.", "In summary, our 2014 results demonstrate the diversity and strength of our business portfolio. We have momentum, and we have exciting growth opportunities for this coming year.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide more details on the results and outlook.", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Thanks, Gary, and good morning everyone. Gary has covered the key performance highlights for the year. I will focus my comments this morning on the drivers behind our fourth quarter performance and discuss our expectations for fiscal 2015.", "Starting first with our results in Q4; sales growth of 11% was led by volume gains in the both the Coatings and Paints segments. The increase in volume was the result of new business wins, core market growth, and from the addition of Inver.", "Our fourth quarter sales also included the benefit of a 53rd week that increased sales by an estimated 3.5%. Excluding acquisitions, our total sales in the quarter were up 9%. Sales in the Coatings segment increased 15%, and volumes increased in all major product lines. Excluding acquisitions, coating sales increased 11%. Within the Coatings segment, packaging sales and volumes were up double-digits, and all geographic regions performed very well. Growth was driven by market growth, share gains, and the success of our non-BPA products.", "General industrial product line sales and volumes also increased double-digits in the quarter. These results exclude the impact of the Inver acquisition. The increase in sales was primarily the result of new business wins in Asia, and improved results in Latin America.", "Coil product line sales were up double-digits, and volumes were up high single-digits in the quarter. We benefited from higher demand in the U.S. driven by improved non-residential construction trends and from new business in Europe and Asia.", "Rounding out our product lines in the Coatings segment, wood sales were flat, and volume was up low single-digits in the quarter.", "Moving on to the Paints segment, total sales increased 7% and volumes were up high single-digits. Our international paint regions had a very strong quarter with double-digit volume increases in China, Australia, and Europe. China growth was driven by increased points of distribution and market share gains across all channels. Growth in Australia was primarily driven by new store openings and new business at Masters. We also saw market share gains across all channels in Australia.", "In Europe, we saw continued growth from the rollout of Valspar branded paints to B&Q stores in the U.K. market. And finally, sales in North America increased low single-digits as we were up against double-digit sales growth last year, driven by the initial load-in of Valspar branded paints at Ace.", "Q4 sales in the home improvement channel increased high single-digits.", "Moving on to gross margin performance, we finished the quarter with total adjusted gross margin of 35.1%, an increase of approximately a 180 basis points over last year. This improvement was the largest increase of the year, and reflected growth from both the Coatings and Paints segments. The increase in gross margins was driven by leverage from higher sales, favorable price cost, and benefits from productivity initiatives.", "Shifting to expenses, Opex in the fourth quarter increased six basis points year-over-year to 20.9% of sales. Operating expense dollars increased 12% versus the previous year, and reflected an improvement over Q3, when expenses were up 20%. This improvement was the result of lower marketing and promotional spending on new growth initiatives in the Paints segment in the fourth quarter.", "In addition, we reached the one year anniversary of Inver. So these operating expenses are now in our base. Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 28%, and EBIT margins increased to 180 basis points, to finish at 14.2% in the fourth quarter.", "In the Coatings segment, adjusted fourth quarter EBIT of a 117 million increased 25% over the previous year, and was 16.9% of sales. The increase in EBIT was the result of increased volume, acquisitions, improved price costs, and productivity initiatives.", "In the Paints segment, EBIT of $70 million was up 41% from the prior year, and was 14.6% of sales. The increase in EBIT was the result of strong sales performance in all international regions, and modest sales growth in North America. We're beginning to see some of the benefits from the investment spending made earlier this year to support our new growth initiatives in paints. These benefits will continue to improve as we more fully leverage these investments with higher sales volumes in the future.", "With that overview of Q4 complete, I'd like to touch on a couple of items related to our full year fiscal 2014 performance before we discuss the outlook for next year. We finished this year with an effective annual tax rate of approximately 30%, which was 100 basis points lower than last year. The reduction was driven by our geographic mix of earnings from strong performance in China and Europe, and from benefits from tax credits.", "Our operating model continues to generate significant cash flow. This allows us to invest in growing the business and to enhance shareholder returns through dividends and share repurchases. Cash flow from operations excluding cash restructuring expenses finished the year at approximately $390 million. For context, this amount included some unique non-recurring uses of cash in the year, and the impact of a balance sheet reclassification, which has no impact on cash.", "Excluding these items, our adjusted cash flow from operations excluding restructuring was closer to 440 million, and increased approximately 7% on a comparable basis. Please note that our GAAP operating cash flow will not include the above items and will therefore be lower.", "Wrapping up the highlights for the year; after investing in CapEx to grow the business we paid $87 million in dividends representing a per share increase of 13%, and repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares of the company stock for a total investment of $349 million.", "With this as context on fiscal 2014, I'd like to move on to discuss our outlook for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, we expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65. Within this guidance are the following assumptions. Total sales growth in the low single-digits, reflecting growth in our Coatings segment from stable end markets and new business wins.", "In the Paints segment, we expect continued growth in China, Australia, and Europe to be offset by the changes in North America that Gary discussed earlier. Even with this headwind, we expect to grow our operating earnings in 2015.", "Our operating model is strong, and remains positioned to deliver growth for the future. We're planning an effective annual tax of 31% to 32% in 2015, and CapEx of approximately $120 million.", "In addition to the above assumptions, I'd also like to highlight three other significant items that impact 2015, and are embedded in our guidance. As I mentioned earlier, we had a 53rd week in 2014, and consequently one less comparable week in 2015. This is approximately 1% headwind to sales and $0.04 to EPS in 2015. We've also assumed that FX will have a negative impact of approximately 3% to sales and $0.12 EPS in 2015.", "And finally, we're planning to take advantage of favorable credit market conditions, and issue new long-term debt during fiscal 2015. As a result, our guidance reflects approximately $75 million in annual interest expense, an increase of $10 million or $0.08 in EPS versus 2014. Proceeds from these issuances will be used to fund existing maturities of long-term debt, and to reduce our short-term borrowings.", "So summing all these three items, the lack of the 53rd week, FX, and increase in initial expense, the total impact to sales and EPS as outlined in our release today is a reduction of approximately 4% to sales growth and $0.24 to EPS in 2015.", "In closing, we delivered very strong performance in fiscal 2014, reflecting the breadth of our portfolio and leadership positions in coatings and paints. Moving into 2015, we remain focused on executing our winning strategies that have delivered superior returns for our shareholders.", "With that, we would like to open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Kevin Hocevar of Northcoast Research.", "Kevin Hocevar", "Hey, good morning, everybody. I was wondering if you could comment a little more on the North American product line that seemed to be a loss. Could you comment on if this was a certain product line, was it a price point, and could this lead to losses of other products with this customer in the future?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. Good morning. Thanks, Kevin. It's Gary, and we've asked the question that's probably on everyone's mind. First, keep in mind that our customer hasn't publicly announced their retailing plan for 2015. And so, that limits what I can talk about today, but here's some additional information that might be helpful. First, while we are disappointed at losing some business, our relationship with this customer remains excellent. This is a partial reset of their alignment, of their line-up, something retailers do on a regular basis.", "With the strength of our relationship and the performance of our brand and products, we fully expect to grow again with this customer of the reset base of business. So the answer to your question about incremental losses beyond this is a no.", "Second, over the past several years, we've grown our global paints business significantly through the strength of the Valspar Huarun and Wattyl brands, new retail programs with many customers and through acquisitions. We're going to continue to do these things.", "Keep in mind, we've got a diversified portfolio of businesses that both Jim and I mentioned, both consumer and industrial, all of which are doing well as evidenced by the great year that we had, and the exceptional fourth quarter. So the breadth and the diversity of our overall business will support our revenue and earnings going forward, and I think the way to think about this, the way I think about this is the one-year step back in our plans to consistently deliver double-digit earnings growth, which I'd expect that we'd pick up again in '16.", "Kevin Hocevar", "Okay. And then in terms of raw materials, I'm wondering with the declines in oil prices that we're seeing, what you're seeing from a raw material standpoint, and if you think that this could be a tailwind for you guys in 2015?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, we're not seeing much, Kevin, because we really -- other than solvents and a couple of other products that we buy, our overall basket is -- it doesn't have a direct correlation with the price of oil, and supply and demand plays a larger part than the oil price. So we're seeing -- we don't expect to see significant inflation in 2015. We're looking for something that is flattish to potentially slightly inflationary again because of supply and demand issues more than the price of oil. So yes, we had a relatively benign raw material environment in 2014, and we're expecting a relatively benign raw material environment in '15.", "Kevin Hocevar", "Okay, great. And then just a final question; I wonder if you can give a little color around operating expenses, because I know you made some investments throughout 2014 to support these new business wins. So how should we think of operating expenses in 2015?", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Hey, Kevin, it's Jim. You correctly point out that -- as we've been talking about the last several quarters, we've made some investments in growing in our business specifically in the Paints segment, related to the new business wins not only at Ace but B&Q. So as you saw on our fourth quarter results, just consistent with our plans as we came out of the paint season, our spending declined pretty significantly from Q3 to Q4.", "Looking forward into next year, those operating costs from those new businesses are in our base. So from a total company standpoint, we're going to have a lot less operating expense growth next year versus what we experienced in 2014, and it's probably going to track the growth in operating income next year should be a little bit less than our sales growth for the year.", "Kevin Hocevar", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Rob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Rob Koort", "Thanks very much. As you might guess, Gary, more questions on the U.S. business loss. How far how do you know these things and what can you guys do to offset it? And it sounds like the scale of it is pretty substantial, about as big as the Ace business you're brining on. So, is there still scope for some fixed cost leverage and margin expansion in that segment or as with your earnings growth sort of differing that double digits for year, does this differ your chance to move margins up and paint in 2015?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Okay, Bob. You asked as you normally do you asked about four different questions in one go. So I've taken notes and I may not hit them all. So we'll come back if I miss one, okay? So, you know about these things, you know about -- we know about this, it's fairly recent news, I'd just say that retailers are constantly changing their retail line-up through process called to line review that happens on a regular basis. There are other changes that take place during -- for us what would be the painting season, but in this particular case, it's relatively recent news for us.", "As I said, our customer hasn't announced their retailing plans for '15. So I'm not going to -- I'm not at liberty to talk in detail about what's going on. I was going to say as I answered Kevin's question, this is a partial reset of their line-up and something that retailers do on a regular basis. You'll recall that Valspar has been the winner in some of these partial resets of retailer's line-ups in the past. In this case, obviously we're not the winner.", "Yes, the number sounds like a big number, but I'd say this, it's a manageable number, and the proof point for that is the confidence that we have in our guidance for next year. We're going to grow our operating income, and we're going to grow our EPS next year. Part of that will be about cost, and cost that we have to take out of the business to deal with this, and part of that will be continued growth in that segment.", "Both products that are not impacted by this partial change at the retailer in question, growth in Australia, growth in China, and growth in our business in Europe. So again -- I'm sorry, I can't give you a lot as much detail as you like on it, because we really have to wait until our customer discloses what they're doing with their retailing plan in 2015. But I'd like you to think about it as a manageable situation for us.", "Rob Koort", "And just to clarify, you talked about EBIT growth at the corporate level or at the paint segment level?", "Gary Hendrickson", "As we always do, Bob, we try not to talk about segment level EBIT. So I'm talking about overall company EBIT.", "Rob Koort", "And can you tell me what you're appetite is for the pace of your repurchase that you might do, I mean, the scale of it is pretty substantial but it's open ended. So, how shall we expect last few years maybe 5% or 6% net reduction in share count? Is that a reasonable expectation going forward or do you think it will be a little more subdued than that?", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Yes, Bob, it's Jim. We've not changed our view of share repurchases going forward. So what we've announced today really is a continued reflection of the past that we've been on over the last four or five years in adding shareholder value through share repurchases. So you shouldn't read into that a stepped up pace from share repurchase activity, and our publicly-stated goal is to reduce share as by 2% a year. As you pointed out, we've done a little better than that in the last several years. We'll do better than that next year, but I think at the high-end of the range you have here, that's a little bit more than we're currently planning for next year, so ordinary course of business repurchase authorization over the next few years.", "Rob Koort", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Hey, the second thing I wanted just to clean up from Kevin's conversation, I believe I've mistakenly said that the growth in operating income was going to be less than our sales growth. What I intended to say, that for 2015, we expect to grow operating expenses less than our sales growth during the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets.", "Ivan Marcuse", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Real quick on the packaging coating, sort of your outlook for growth and lookout for 2015; do you expect that to continue to grow or do you expect that momentum to increase with the non-BPA continue to take hold the sort of your view there?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. Good morning, Ivan, it's Gary. Yes, our packaging product line had a great year in 2014. We're fortunate that with the exception of the North America market, we're seeing market growth in all of the regions in the world, and we've got our fair share of that market growth.", "Our target for this business has been for 20 years that I have been involved with packaging coating at Valspar to grow at least twice the market rate, and we feel like we did that this year. We did that through good execution as the leader. We have a lot of levels that we can pull in packaging coatings. We did that through good execution and the long relationships that we have with our customers delivering new technology and some pretty significant wins with our new non-BPA technology both in North America and in Europe.", "So, our outlook for 2015 is to continue to grow, and we'd be targeting as we always do growth of that lately two times market growth.", "Ivan Marcuse", "", "Great, but you're not expecting this is some sort of non-BPA or some reason -- give a little bit of a boost beyond what typical market growth is?", "Gary Hendrickson", "", "Yes, this year. They did in '14, and I'd expect that we'll see some tailwinds from that again in '15, Ivan.", "Ivan Marcuse", "Great, thanks for taking my question.", "Gary Hendrickson", "", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We go next to line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Q \u2013 David Begleiter", "", "Thank you. Hey, Gary, just on gross margins, I know you were talking about benign raw materials environment in next year, but just go back to 2009 when raw materials dropped a lot, you saw substantial expansion in your gross margins and you're trying to be conservative about it. Why wouldn't we see at least gross margin expansion next year given that what we seen already on the oil side?", "Gary Hendrickson", "", "Yes, it's just hard to predict what beyond a quarter, David. So it's hard for us to predict what raw material cost will do. We look at the same macro data that you do and as I said to Kevin earlier supply and demand has a much larger role in our overall basket than the price of any particular commodity.", "So that's why we're remodeling in our guidance for the year relatively benign environment. Keep in mind too that if you look at our guidance for next year, you think about our gross margin, we're going to have an impact of this North America situation that we talked about, and that will be an offset to what might have been a bit more gross margin expansion than anyone would have expected.", "", "Q \u2013 David Begleiter", "", "Fair enough. I just find the increase in debt. You're going to increase your actually amount of debt next year or we're not giving some pay-off of existing short term.", "A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer", "", "Hey, David, it's Jim. By the year end next year, it will be up a little bit. In the near term, what we're essentially going to do is term out some of the commercial paper, what we're using today to manage the business. As you know we're using a large chunk of our annual cash flow after CapEx to repurchase the company's shares. Obviously that's a long-term commitment to the growing shareholder value. We want to match that with the favorable long-term credit environment that we see right now on the loan interest rates for the future. We've been out in the market about every two years with the debt offering, so this is just ordinary course of business.", "Q \u2013 David Begleiter", "Thank you very much.", "A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We'll go next to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Hey, guys, good morning. Happy thanksgiving week.", "Gary Hendrickson", "", "Same to you.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Yes, thanks. Just on the quarterly earnings distribution for '15, obviously lot of moving pieces and did you call that the extra week for 4Q of next year, but 2014 also had a lot of moving parts with the Ace load-in and the SG&A movement around et cetera. So anything we should keep in mind, Jim as we kind of think through the quarterly distribution for the year?", "A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer", "", "First, congratulations on having an excellent memory, because you correctly pointed out a number of the drivers we'll be up against next year. One of the benefits of having a growing business is that we have got the opportunity to invest in new business, add significant amounts of volume that results in load-in patterns with retailers.", "If we look into next year, you're correct, Ghansham, that we are going to anniversary a lot of those activities. We're going to have pressure on volumes in the first half of the year in our Paints segment, because we were loading in the branded Valspar Paint at Ace during the first half of the year. So that's going to put some pressure on the top line. You'll also recall that we had the highest level of EBIT performance in Q1 of last year in the Paints segment, because we really hadn't matched that volume with the investment spending in promotional and marketing support that happens during paint season.", "So we're looking at the growth for next year to be more focused in the back half of year from the front half of the year, and Q2 is probably going to be one of our bigger challenges in total, just given the volume load-ins we had in advance for paint season in both the --primarily the North American business.", "As we get into the back half of the year, we'll see the roll over benefits of the initiatives that we have both in B&Q and Ace and we'll continue to see further expansion from the strong performance on our coatings businesses.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Okay that's helpful. And just to clarify your 2Q -- for your fiscal year 2Q is when you'll see the impact \u2013- will start seeing the impacts from the market shares, correct?", "A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer", "", "Yes, I think we'll see a little bit potentially at the mid end of Q1 here, but most of that will start in Q2.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Okay. And then switching to packaging, if you could just give us some feedback on your technology on non-BPA coating the customers are sharing relative to some of the other alternatives that would be helpful too, thanks.", "A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer", "", "Sorry, I don't hear you. Could you pass that question again, Ghansham?", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Yes, just on packaging, just your feedbacks from customers on your technology for non-BPA coating particularly in the food can side versus some of the other alternatives that are out there?", "A \u2013 Jim Muehlbauer", "", "I think our customers would say that we're leading.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. We go next to the line of P. J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.", "P. J. Juvekar", "", "Yes, hi good morning. China seems to be slowing and Australia is heavily depended on China. But you're quite bullish on those two countries given that you already gaining share there. so can you talk about competitive landscape in those two countries in architectural paints that is allowed you to gain share?", "Gary Hendrickson", "", "Yes, P. J. It's Gary. First, I'll talk about Australia first. We've owned Wattyl for several years now. And really for the first three years, we were focused on fixing what was fundamentally a broken business. And it was broken in many different ways; operationally, cost-wise, relationships with customers weren't good, distribution was not right, there were some product issues. We had lots and lots of problems. We fixed those problems now. And for the last five quarters, we've been taking share, and this is independent third-party data from the Australian Paint Manufacturing Federation that says that our Wattyl team has been taking share in both DIY and the pro.", "So we expect in Australia that trend will continue. We also believe that at a minimum, the Australian housing market has bottomed out and is starting to improve. Their data points would suggest that the market is improving somewhat. We have the ability to grow our business now because of the changes that we've made and the very positive improvement that we've made both in our business model and our team there. We feel like we have the opportunity to grow into that market.", "At retail, in particular, our success with Masters and the partnership we've with Masters has been fabulous. I can't quote the exact number, but the vast majority of the paint that's sold in a Master store is the Valspar brand or one of the Wattyl brand, and Masters will continue to build out their stores. We'll have the benefit of the stores that were set halfway through '14 carrying over into '15. So we expect to be growing in the retail side, in the independent hardware channel, excuse me, in the big box channel. And in the independent hardware channel, which is the third channel in Australia, we've had some market share wins in '14 that we're carrying into '15. So, our competitive position in the Australian market is very strong, and as I said, we believe that the housing market is recovering somewhat.", "In China, it's true that the growth rate in China if you believe 7.5 or so GDP growth, it's lower than it used to be, but it's still 7.5% GDP growth. And recently the Chinese government has reinitiated their support for the housing market in China. This is a potentially large change for us. For the last four years at least the China government has not been supporting housing. This would be the first year that our team has the tailwinds of a China government in a long time that has tailwinds of the China government that's supporting the housing market. We think the macro in China is good, but we've grown roughly double-digits for the last four years or so, even in an environment where the housing market wasn't in a great shape, and we've done that through increasing our point of distribution with our exclusive retail. I think you know that we opened up nonexclusive distribution. We have something like, Bill, what's the number, 4000 to 5000 points of distribution, that we didn't have a few years ago for our affordable housing products that go through nonexclusive distribution.", "And in the project channel, which is the basically the direct sale to big housing projects, we've gone from a very small base to a reasonable sized business in the last few years. So in all channels in the Chinese market we're having success as well, and we believe that the housing market is going to be supported by the government for a while. So, probably a longer answer than you wanted, but you asked for it, P. J.", "P. J. Juvekar", "Thank you. I appreciate that. And just one quick question on your U.S. business that you lost; it seems that your customer gives you business for a full year and for next couple of years it gives business to your competitor to keep everybody at a balanced and fair. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I don't think that's the driver. I mean, retailers are always trying new things. I mean, they've -- consumer tastes are changing -- are constantly changing, and retailers are constantly trying new things to adapt to changing consumer taste, and they're trying new things to bring more customers into the store. And I think that's the real basis for which for the retailer making a change in the product line.", "P. J. Juvekar", "Okay, thank you.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll next go to the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer", "Yes. Good morning, guys. If you look at the sales in the paint store, what kind of volumes you're expecting ex the loss of this one piece of business next year in your guidance?", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Yes, Duffy, it's Jim. We're not going to break out the detail volumes by the channels in our business next year as we said. This is going to put some pressure on our growth trajectory in paints in total next year, primarily driven by the North America business. We're going to be able to offset some of that pressure, with the growth that Gary described in Australia, China and certainly does continue to roll out as B&Q. But, yes, we're not going to get into the detail around the volumes in the North American channel.", "Duffy Fischer", "But would -- I mean, would North American volumes and general store continue to grow ex this one piece of business that you lost, I mean, from a volume standpoint. Is that fair to assume?", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Yes. That's kind of the -- Duffy, that's the point I made earlier when I was speaking with Kevin about a reset base, I think about this as a reset base. So we lose some business that we set the base, and we expect that all of the other products around that lost product like at this retailer will grow -- we expect that will grow eight volumes next year. And we expect it will grow volumes with the other 5000 or so independent retailers that -- the small retailers that we do business with.", "Duffy Fischer", "Okay, great. And the two issues that are a little bit of a hit issue, obviously the loss of that piece of a business and then the interest rates step up, how should we think about the hangover from those two things as we get into '16. It feels like these will start to roll in probably in near Q2, so maybe we have one quarter of annualization [ph] when we get to 2016. Is that the right way to think about both of those?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes. I think that's right. I think a vast majority of the business change in North America will be this year while this little tail on in Q1 next year, and same as through for the step up in the interest expense.", "Duffy Fischer", "Okay, great. And then just a last one on the BQ business, you mentioned you are in 300 stores there. I mean, just give us a rundown how is that going both from a penetration standpoint and then from kind of an operations profitability standpoint relative to your original expectations?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Okay. Well, it's -- we're a little bit slower in rolling the program out than we originally thought and that's because these are large format stores at B&Q are more complex to reset than both parties thought. But we expect to have all of the stores is that at the end -- by the end of this year, it'll be 350 stores. And this was a deluded program last year; it will be an accretive program this year.", "What changes this year is that after we get all 350 stores set, we turn on marketing. So that will be more expense in the business, in 2015. So we'll be selling though our paint at 350 stores and so we have the gross margin dollars to support the expense. So the business starts to look like a normal business and 2015 up here's another way to say that.", "And you asked about customer acceptance or how is it performing. This is a tinted program. We essentially brought in the same type of a program that we use with retail. Retailers in North America, where consumers have a lot more color choice and retailers carry a lot less inventory because we tint our products up of base colors. And so we set a goal and we're at the point now we're at the tinting processes within that store, is about two racks what it formally was in the stores that are set.", "And again, that's before we turned on any marketing, any promotion. So, we expect that the program I think our retail partner believes that the program is going to be very successful and hit all the metrics or receive the metrics that we set out in the beginning.", "Duffy Fischer", "Great. Thanks, fellas.", "Gary Hendrickson", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of John McNulty at Credit Suisse.", "John McNulty", "Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, in the coating segment, if I recall ex acquisitions, you saw a 11% sales growth in and kind of high single-digit volume growth. Should we assume that the rest of that is price mix around the packaging business or are there other parts that are helping to carry some of that weight as well?", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Yes, John, it's Jim. Most of that is volume. Price mix, as Gary talked about before is been relatively about benign for us. We'd certainly done better given the mix shift a little bit more heavy packaging, but a vast majority of the volume improvement across each of the coatings businesses.", "John McNulty", "Okay.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Someone asked me this question last call. All of the businesses that we have in our coating segment, our all the product lines are very profitable. Our profitable product lines are to at this point in time. Some products within those product lines are more profitable in the overall average and that's where we get out mix benefit, it's not necessarily we're selling more of one product line or another but it's the mix within the product line there that can be helpful and that was the case in this quarter.", "John McNulty", "Okay, fair enough. And then it does sound like a lot of the volume growth came from some wins on the BPA free coating side. Where there any other big pockets where volumes were noticeably higher than kind of the industry growth rates or growth rates that you're servicing that we should be thinking about?", "Gary Hendrickson", "All are packaging, the packaging growth rate in general was higher than the industry. It was at least two ex the industry growth rate. Everywhere with the exception of Asia where I think we grew probably more or less at the market growth rate for some unique challenges that we had this year, but we still grew the business double-digits and I think next year will be even better, but it was just solid growth across virtually all the product lines and all of the segments within each of those product lines. It was just a good quarter all around.", "John McNulty", "Okay, fair enough. And then just with regard to the North American paint market, would you say the competitive environment has changed over the past few years or is it basically kind of the same?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Well, we -- I mean, the industry structure has obviously changed with Axel no longer in the picture. So that's been a significant change. I wouldn't -- beyond that I wouldn't say that it's changed significantly, John.", "John McNulty", "Okay. So it's not that it's more aggressive of a less aggressive that part seems like it's relatively stable?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Yes.", "John McNulty", "Okay. Thanks very much for the time.", "Operator", "We'll go next to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.", "Don Carson", "Yes. You talked earlier about B&Q but I wanted to ask you question on your other retail growth initiatives, Lowe's, Pro, and Ace first off. I assume Lowe's Pro is still a program you'll have next year, that's not the one you lost, but I know the past you talked about that being a $125 million opportunity, Ace being a 150 million. So do you think you'll hit that run rate in 2015 and in what incremental accretions should we expect from those initiatives next year?", "Gary Hendrickson", "I think we'll be at our run rate at Ace. The run rate that we said would be about a $150 million in 2015, we will be at that run rate and that will be more accretive than the year we had a partial year of dilution at Ace in '14, Don, so the full year next year, we'll be accretive at Ace. And our business -- Pro business that Lowe's grew in the year, and I expect that it will grow next year.", "Don Carson", "", "", "Okay. And then in terms of your mix that sounds like paints that you must have lost a high-priced business because you're talking about revenue, I think being up more or up less rather than volume once again next year. Is that -- am I interpreting that correctly?", "Gary Hendrickson", "", "Yes, I'm not going to say it, Don. That's too specific. I'm just going to stick with my language, which is at least my customer would expect two years which is to say that it's a partial reset of your line-up.", "Don Carson", "", "All right, okay. Thank you.", "Gary Hendrickson", "", "Thanks, Don.", "Operator", "", "We go next to the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.", "Matt Grainger", "", "Hi, this is Matt Grainger on behalf of Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak more to what you're seeing on the ground in Europe and the drivers of differentiation there between your success and the broader macro environment.", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "Sorry, Matt, I missed your -- I was taking the notes and I missed your name. It's Gary, sorry. So our business in Europe, just to make sure that everyone is clear what I'd think about it. It's a packaging business and an industrial business. A large very successful packaging business where we feel like we're differentiating particularly on non-BPA products and our Europe packaging business last year had a fantastic year. The other parts of our businesses our industrial business which is a combination of Inver, the business that we acquired in 2013, and our legacy business which is a general industrial and coil business. We integrated Inver last year. We optimized the supply chain. We organized our sales force. We did a lot of good things and complicated things. And in the midst of all that, the leadership there grew the business and made the business more profitable. So we feel like we're very well-positioned in Europe market now in packaging and industrial. And the third part of our business is B&Q, which we talked about with previous callers.", "Matt Grainger", "", "Great. Thanks, folks. I'll leave it there.", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "Thanks.", "Operator", "We go next to the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Good morning, guys. Couple of questions if I may; first of all, your general industrial was up double-digits in the quarter which is quite strong and probably little bit stronger than the market overall, especially from what I'm understanding is the Ag business continues to drag in terms of capital equipment and probably will continue to do so in 2015. So how do you look at your general industrial business in 2015 in terms of our deltas in Ag getting easier to overcome with the growth in another general industrial businesses, or is there something specific sort of beyond the Inver or maybe the Inver brought you that allows you to grow faster than the market?", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "Dmitry, now we had a rally strong year and a really strong quarter in China. That was the region of our general industrial business that grew the most and influenced the overall product lien results. Europe was good, North America, I wouldn't say that we probably grew in line with the market. Europe, I think we probably grew a little bit faster than the market. So you take those three factors together -- and Latin America is a small business for us. So U.S. at the market, Europe grew faster than the market, and Asia, a phenomenal quarter that we got the double-digits.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "", "What was the phenomenal -- I mean that's my question I guess. Did we get through sort of the worst of the impact of the drivers that cause your 2013 to be a down year in terms of general industrial and the Ag and mining equipment sales? Is the anniversarying event or the improvement in that market, what's behind this strong result?", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "We've had a very successful few years, Dmitry expanding our penetration into the heavy equipment market in China. And we're doing our bulk of business, a number of customers that we do business with in that market today is much larger than it was a couple of years ago. Many of the local players in the China market are now customers of Valspar. I wouldn't call a rebound in the Ag and construction market anywhere.", "Some of the plants that we weren't doing business are the multinationals -- customers that we have been not running their plants in 2013; we're running plants in 2014. But there are pretty reduced rates. It felt kind of like an inventory fill rather than you just topping the inventory rather than any significant rebound.", "So now the results in general and industrial, keep in mind, in general and industrial we have in China we have Ag and construction, we have pipe and rebar and we have our container business, and remember that we started at the Maersk container line last quarter, sorry, two quarters ago and our third quarter, and that line is running more less at operational rates now. So we got to benefit from that as well.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "That's helpful, Gary. Thanks. And then one follow-up question on the Australian business, you described sort of the efforts that went into fixing Wattyl, I think at one time this was like a free percent operating margin which you got up to about 6% and then you started seeing volume growth in the past quarters and it got up into double digit range. What's your expectation for 2015 margin for that business as the growth continues? Can it approach the low timid teams you're seeing in your North American paint business?", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "I think that might be one year early. That's what we're expecting for 2106, Dmitry. Next year we're going to be close to consistently double digit EBIT margin rates. Thanks.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "", "Got it. I mean in a little bit of growth almost doubling your margins next year is still a pretty strong earnings driver from the way I look at it, at least.", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "Well, we're not calling a doubling of earnings in Australia. We finished a little bit higher than you think I think you think we did this year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "", "Okay, all right. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "We go to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "", "Q \u2013 Nils Wallin", "Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just curious how much the Australia and/or the China market can grow before you need to make further investments to fulfill that market need?", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "Nils, we worked fine in Australia. They can roll a lot before we -- I don't know the exact number, but we have plenty of capacity in Australia. In China, you may recall that we announced 18 months or so ago that we're building a new plant in Tianjin, that plant is still under construction and that's to support the future growth of our consumer business than in some of our industrial businesses. So it will be another couple of years at least before we need another plant in China.", "Q \u2013 Nils Wallin", "", "Understood. I know that obviously it's still fairly early on the B&Q roll out and seeing how that goes but certainly there is a lot of opportunity there into the Kingfisher store. So curious whether its months or years before there might be a decision to expand into the Kingfisher as well?", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "Well, it's not our decision to make. So I really can't call that one. We are focused now this year is to execute extremely well at the end Q. and we think if we do that there would be other retailers possibly Kingfisher that would like us to do something with them in Europe.", "Q \u2013 Nils Wallin", "Understood. And then just finally we haven't spoken other than Inver, when lapping that, but not a lot of M&A recently and some of one of your competitors has spoken publicly of seeing some degree of acceleration. I'm curious what you see in terms of pipeline and where you're most excited whether in coatings or in paints?", "A \u2013 Gary Hendrickson", "", "I don't know that necessarily that -- we'd say there has been an acceleration. We're talking to a lot of people and we will continue to talk to a lot of people. I'd say it's probably more there lot more -- there's a lot more fragmentation in the industrial markets than there is in paint market. So I'd suggest that you'd see more consolidation in that industrial market. We did do one a couple of weeks ago. You may not record it. That was a small one that we have acquired a company in Canada that's in pipe coating industry, a very well-respected 30-40 year old company with global approval for the water pipe and water infrastructure market, which is the tuck in for our pipe coating business that we think is going to be very good for our sales and our customers.", "Q \u2013 Nils Wallin", "", "Understood. Thanks very much for the color.", "Bill Seymour", "Operator, this will be the last question, and then Gary will have some closing comments afterwards.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Thanks, guys. I guess coatings were fast, it looks like you really broader margins there. What's going to drive further margin expansion in that business operating at historical peaks?", "Gary Hendrickson", "Arun, it's going to be that growth, and the operating leverage, and other benefits that we get from growth. So as I said on this call and several other occasions, if we can maintain these margin rates, which I believe we can, and continue growing the business, then we're going to -- that growth is going to be very accretive to Valspar's bottom line.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Okay. And then just to clarify, what are some of the -- couple, maybe one or two assumptions that you have that will push you to the bottom end or the upper end of your guidance range for next year? Thanks.", "Jim Muehlbauer", "Yes. Arun, it's Jim. Clearly without getting into detail, the eventual sales volume for next year is obviously the biggest driver in how we'd perform overall, plus what we may or may not see in the raw material environment next year, up, flat, down, that's going to be probably the second biggest driver of the mix. Apart from that, we obviously have the most control over. These are variable spending. And we as always toggle that as best we can with the long-term goal of continuing to drive value for our shareholders. So I really say sales trends from a macro standpoint and commodities environment being the two biggest drivers in our range.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Okay, thanks.", "Gary Hendrickson", "Arun, thanks for setting up my closing comment. Let me sum up the call by explaining why we're confident about our 2015 guidance. First, our strong momentum in 2014 will continue into 2015. The U.S. economy is improving, and that bodes well for our general, industrial, and coil coatings. And improving U.S. housing markets is good for all of our paint business, and all of our retail customers in the U.S. and for our wood coatings product line.", "Additionally, as we talked about on the call, the sectors we serve in Australia and China housing markets are growing. So, in an improving environment we have a full fiscal year of Valspar paints at Ace, B&Q, and Masters, and at Lowe's Valspar Reserve has been an outstanding success, and we'll continue to grow next year and beyond.", "Our coatings business also has good momentum, particularly in Europe and Asia as I mentioned with Dmitry, and the shift to non-BPA coatings in Europe and North America is a plus for our packaging product line. Thus we expect to continue to take market share.", "On the cost side of the ledger, we expect carryover benefits from the productivity programs in 2014. And as I mentioned earlier, we'll be implementing new productivity and cost reduction programs in 2015. And we'll have fewer shares outstanding as more shares are purchased as part of our buyback authorization.", "So I'll conclude by saying that Valspar is in great shape, and all of our employees are looking forward to another year of growth in 2015.", "Thanks for your time today. I hope you have a happy thanksgiving, and we look forward to seeing you next week in New York at our Investor Day.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Thank you for joining the Sherwin-Williams Company's review of Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Results and Expectations for 2015. This conference call is being webcast simultaneously in listen-only mode by Vcall via the Internet at www.sherwin.com. An archived replay of this webcast will be available at www.sherwin.com beginning approximately 2 hours after this conference call concludes and will be available until Wednesday, February 18, 2015 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Standard time. Following the company's year-end financial results and outlook for 2015, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thank you, Roya. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We appreciate your interest in Sherwin-Williams. We're going to begin the call today with some prepared remarks by Chris Connor, our Chairman and CEO; and John Morikis, President and Chief Operating Officer. Following their remarks, we will open the call to questions, and Sean Hennessy, our Chief Financial Officer; and Al Mistysyn, Vice President and Corporate Controller are with us this afternoon to participate in the Q&A session.", "Before I pass the microphone to Chris, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements as defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.", "A full declaration regarding forward-looking statements is provided in our earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. In the interest of time, as usual, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, Quarterly Results Fourth Quarter.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everybody. I want to begin by thanking you for accommodating our very late change in the scheduled time for this call. A long-tenured senior executive of our company and a good friend to all of us on this side of the line lost a 26-year-old son unexpectedly this week. This morning was our only opportunity to pay our respects to this fine family and participate in the memorial service, an opportunity we couldn't pass up. We thank you for your understanding and your willingness to alter your busy schedules to be with us on the call this afternoon.", "With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. I'll be back after his comments to share a few thoughts of my own. John?", "John G. Morikis", "Thanks, Chris, and good afternoon, everyone. Looking back on 2014, 2 prominent themes stand out in my mind. The first is the continued strength of our operating results during the year, with record sales, record EBITDA, record net income and earnings per share. The second is that we accomplished these financial milestones while continuing to make prudent investments in our future. As a result, we're entering 2015 very well positioned to grow market share and deliver even stronger sales and earnings.", "Our consolidated sales in the fourth quarter increased 4.6% to $2.57 billion, due primarily to higher paint sales volume through our Paint Stores Group. For the full year, sales increased 9.3% to $11.13 billion. Acquisitions had no effect on consolidated net sales growth in the quarter but increased sales approximately 3.1% in the full year.", "Currency translation rate changes decreased consolidated net sales 2.3% in the quarter and 1.4% for the year. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter increased to 47.4% of sales from 45.8% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase in gross margin in the quarter was primarily due to improved fixed cost absorption from increased sales volumes, the TiO2 settlement detailed in our third quarter 10-Q and year-over-year progress from the Comex acquisition.", "For the year, gross margin increased to 46.4% of sales from 45.3% of sales last year. The increase in gross margin for the year was primarily due to increased sales volumes, partially offset by acquisitions.", "Selling, general and administrative expense in dollars increased $23.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter last year, but decreased as a percent of sales to 38.3% from 39.2% in the same quarter last year.", "For the full year 2014, SG&A expense increased $355.3 million to $3.82 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 34.3% from 34% in 2013. Incremental SG&A from acquisitions, new stores and customer service investments accounted for the majority of the SG&A increase in the year. Other general expense increased $28.2 million in the fourth quarter and $35 million for the year, due primarily to higher environmental accruals in both periods.", "Interest expense for the quarter decreased $1.5 million to $15.4 million. For the year, interest expense was $64.2 million compared to $62.7 million in 2013. Profit before tax in the fourth quarter increased 26.6% to $188.9 million, and for the full year, increased 15.9% to $1.26 billion.", "Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter 2014 increased to 29.7% from 22.2% in the fourth quarter of 2013. For the year, our effective tax rate was 31.2% compared to 30.7% in 2013. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter and full year 2013 were favorably impacted by the integration of Comex stores and would have been 32.3% and 32.1%, respectively, without Comex. Consolidated net income for the quarter increased $16.6 million to $132.7 million. For the year, net income increased $113.3 million to $865.9 million.", "Net income as a percent of sales in the quarter increased to 5.2% from 4.7% last year. For the year, net income as a percent of sales increased to 7.8% from 7.4% in 2013. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter 2014 increased to $1.37 from $1.14 per share in the fourth quarter 2013. For the year, diluted net income per common share increased 20.9% to $8.78 per share from $7.26 per share in 2013. Now let me take a few minutes to break down our performance by segment.", "Sales by our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter 2014 increased 8% to $1.58 billion, thanks to higher paint sales volumes across all customer segments. For the year, net sales increased 14.2% to $6.85 billion. This full year sales increase was also driven by higher paint sales volumes across all customer segments, plus the Comex acquisition. The acquisition increased Paint Stores Group net sales 4.5% for the full year. Comparable store sales increased 7.5% in the quarter and 8.8% in the year.", "Regionally, in the fourth quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Southwestern division, our Midwestern division and our Eastern division. Fourth quarter segment profit for the Paint Stores Group increased 46.9% to $247.5 million from $168.5 million in the fourth quarter last year, due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes and improved operating results from the acquired Comex stores.", "For the full year, Paint Stores Group profit increased 21.3% to $1.2 billion from $990.5 million in 2013. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and a loss from acquisitions. Acquisitions reduced full year segment profit by $32.3 million.", "Segment profit margin for the fourth quarter increased to 15.6% from 11.5% last year. Profit margin for the full year 2014 increased to 17.5% from 16.5% in 2013.", "Turning now to the Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased 1.6% to $276.9 million, due primarily to higher volume sales for most of the group's retail customers. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased 5.9% to $1.42 billion, as a result of acquisitions and increased order volume for most of the group's retail customers.", "Acquisitions increased net sales by 3.4% in the year. Segment profit for the fourth quarter decreased to $30.3 million from $36 million in fourth quarter 2013, primarily as a result of higher operating costs in advance of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams program rollout at Lowe's. For the year, segment profit increased 4.5% to $259.2 million from $242.1 million in 2013. This increase was primarily due to higher sales volume and improved operating efficiencies, partially offset by the higher operating costs related to the Lowe's rollout.", "Acquisitions had no significant impact on segment profit in the full year. Consumer Group segment profit as a percent of sales in the fourth quarter decreased 11% from 13 -- to 11% from 13.2% last year due to higher operating costs from the Lowe's program. For the year, segment profit margin decreased to 17.8% from 18% last year for much the same reason.", "For the Global Finishes Group. Fourth quarter net sales in U.S. dollars increased 1.1% to $502.4 million, and for full year, sales decreased 3.8% to $2.08 billion, due primarily to selling price increases and higher paint sales volumes, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation.", "Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 4.1% in the quarter and 1.6% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased to $39 million from $37.7 million last year. The increase in segment profit in the quarter resulted from increased operating efficiencies and higher year-over-year selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $10.2 million. For the year, segment profit increased 17.9% to $201.1 million from $170.6 million last year.", "This full year profit improvement resulted from increased operating efficiencies, selling price increases and a $6.3 million gain on the early termination of a customer agreement reported in the third quarter, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation of $13.5 million. As a percent of net sales, Global Finishes Group's operating profit was 7.8% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.6% last year, and 9.7% for the year compared to 8.5% in 2013.", "For our Latin America's Coatings Group. Net sales decreased 6.7% to $207.4 million in the fourth quarter and decreased 7.3% to $771.4 million for the full year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices.", "Currency translation decreased in U.S. dollars by 13.5% in the quarter and 12.3% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group segment profit in the quarter decreased to $13 million from $17.9 million last year, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by selling price increases.", "Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $4.9 million in the quarter. For the year, segment profit increased to $40.5 million from $38.6 million in 2013. As a reminder, in 2013 we incurred charges of $31.6 million to satisfy tax assessments in Brazil. Unfavorable currency translations decreased profit $15.7 million in the year. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was 6.3% in the fourth quarter compared to 8.1% last year, and 5.2% for the year compared to 4.6% in 2013.", "That concludes my review of our operating results in the fourth quarter and full year 2014, so let me turn the call back over to Chris Connor, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2015.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Thanks, John. It's a pleasure to add a few comments to the strong numbers John just walked you through. More than $11 billion in sales, an increase of almost $1 billion, consolidated gross margin above 46% for the first time ever, profit before tax that eclipsed $1.25 billion and EBITDA north of $1.5 billion. All that led to earnings per share up 21% in the year.", "As John mentioned in his opening remarks, we also measure our success in 2014 by how well the company is positioned going into this year. We made great progress during the year on integration of the U.S. and Canadian Comex stores, the largest Paint Stores acquisition in our history. We stabilized sales volumes in these stores and significantly improved product assortment and product availability, all of which will result in a positive contribution to the Paint Stores Group operating profit in 2015.", "During the year, we also realigned our Paint Stores Group and Latin American Coatings Group under a unified management team led by Jay Davisson. This move will enable us to share expertise between the 2 business units and better leverage our operating, technical and supply chain resources, which will benefit both organizations in the long run.", "In December, we announced our first-ever architectural paint program in Lowe's stores nationwide under the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams brand. We're excited about this program, which will begin shipping in early spring, just in time for the start of the painting season.", "In 2014, we generated more than $1 billion in net operating cash for the second consecutive year, thanks in part to the terrific working capital management by all of our operating segments.", "In spite of a fourth quarter inventory build to support the HGTV HOME rollout at Lowe's, our working capital ratio dropped to 10.1% of sales from 10.5% last year. This improvement is further evidence of the progress our Paint Stores Group and global supply chain teams have made in integrating the Comex acquisition. We used this cash from operations, along with the excess cash on our balance sheet at the start of the year, to fund capital expenditures, expand our controlled distribution, raise our dividend and buy back shares for treasury.", "Our capital expenditures in 2014 totaled $207.9 million. Depreciation for the year was $169.1 million, and amortization was $29.9 million.", "In 2015, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $175 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending was higher than normal in 2014, and will be again in 2015 as we complete the conversion of Comex store locations to Sherwin-Williams. We expect CapEx to return to more normal levels beginning in 2016.", "In December, our Paint Stores Group celebrated the opening of our 4,000th paint store. For the year, we exceeded our initial expectation of opening 80 to 90 new stores and finished the year with 95 net new locations and 4,003 total stores in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean. We remain confident that our goal of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic, and we intend to get closer to that goal by 100 to 110 stores this coming year.", "During the past year, we hired more than 1,400 new college graduates into our management training program to bolster our store staffing, improve our territory coverage and fill our store management pipeline.", "Although these investments tend to drive SG&A higher in the back half of the year, new stores and service employees pay for themselves over a very short period of time. At year-end, our total debt was $1.8 billion and cash on hand was $41 million compared to a cash balance of $745 million at the end of 2013.", "In 2014, we've returned more than $1.7 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the fourth quarter, we acquired 1.6 million shares of the company stock for treasury, bringing our full year total to 6.93 million shares at an average cost of $214.97 per share, for a total investment of $1.49 billion.", "At year-end, we have remaining authorization to acquire another 5.23 million shares. We paid $215 million in cash to shareholders through quarterly dividends. 2014 marked our 36th consecutive year of increased dividends per share, a string we intend to continue. This year, at our February board meeting, we will recommend approval of an annual dividend of $2.68 per share, an increase of 22% over 2014.", "Looking ahead to 2015, the paint and coatings demand in most domestic markets looks encouraging. Residential starts and turnover gained momentum in the fourth quarter, even in the oil patch areas of the South, which bodes well for the coming year. Contracts for new nonresidential square footage were up 7% year-over-year in 2014. And the pace of demand growth in segments such as office, hospitality, warehousing and apartment buildings remained strong.", "Although the rate of growth in manufacturing activity slowed at year-end, December marked the 19th consecutive month of expansion, which should drive continued growth in demand for our industrial coatings.", "Outside the United States, it appears likely that sluggish market conditions and currency devaluation in Europe as well as many Latin American countries will remain a challenge.", "Our raw material basket has many moving parts. But in total, we believe we're likely to see stable to declining input costs for this year. The drop in the price of crude oil, if sustained, will no doubt have a positive impact on the petrochemical side of our raw material basket.", "But these commodities will not necessarily move in a linear relationship with crude. High-grade chloride TiO2 pricing held steady over the back half of 2014, but soft order volumes and excess inventory suggest pricing should remain stable for the foreseeable future. Based on these factors, we would expect average year-over-year raw material cost inflation for the paint and coating industry to be down in the low single-digit range in 2015.", "Our outlook for the first quarter 2015 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid-single-digits percentage range compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.30 to $1.45 per share, compared to $1.14 per share earned in the first quarter of 2014.", "Embedded in this guidance is our expectation that we will incur some onetime expenses related to the rollout of the HGTV HOME program at Lowe's stores. For the full year 2015, we expect net sales will increase in the high single-digit percentage range compared to full year 2014. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2015 will be in the range of $10.90 to $11.10 per share, compared to $8.78 in 2014.", "Again, we'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "First off on your sales guidance for '15 calling for a high single-digit increase. Comparisons in the Paint Stores Group get quite a bit more difficult as the year progresses, and then I think you have some headwinds from FX also. So first off, can you maybe parse out the various end-market drivers that will get you towards that sales growth level, starting with maybe your expectation for what gallonage growth will be in the U.S. for '15?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, Ghansham, it's Bob. As we've often said, to hit our guidance range for the full year at high single digits, Paint Stores Group would have to be at or above that level, and that is certainly our expectation. We believe that, that will outpace gallon growth in the domestic market by, again, probably close to a factor of 2x. We would expect low- to mid-single-digit growth in the market, probably slightly above the rate of growth in 2014, which we estimate to be more in like the 3.5% range. So it should pick up. Also embedded in the consolidated sales guidance is the impact from Lowe's, which we've said would be low single-digit lift on consolidated sales.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then in terms of the guidance increase versus your mid-December update, I guess, is that primarily due to the lower raw material costs that you are now forecasting?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Good afternoon. This is Sean Hennessy. No, I would say that the raw materials, when you look at the $10.75 mid-point to $11 mid-point, it was mostly driven by raw materials. There was -- we also had a little more foreign currency. The sales went from 7 to 11 to high single digits, so they have a little more effect on foreign currency. But there were raws -- and there were other factors, but raws were a major part.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So I guess just maybe you can just give us an update on what you're hearing from your customers so far. I know it's still early in the year. But on the backlog side, contractors as well as maybe non-paint items within the stores.", "John G. Morikis", "I'd say that our customers are feeling pretty good about their future. Many of them are looking at bookings that they've said they've not seen in quite some time. And let's say, quarter-after-quarter here recently, it seems as though they're becoming more and more bullish. So I think it's looking very well through the lens of our customers. As far as the nonpaying sales, those are performing very well. We're seeing strong performance in our sundries and our spray equipment sales. And as you know, we use that -- sorry, we use that gauge of the spray equipment sales as a bit of an indicator for us as to the confidence of the contractors, so those bode well for us.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So you have seen some, I guess, building backlogs there. And then is there any kind of difference between trends that you're seeing in res versus nonres, especially in the U.S.?", "Robert J. Wells", "In terms of the macro data that we're looking at, we're seeing nonres actually outpace res in starts for 2014. Going forward, we think that the housing activity should pick up, we'll see solid growth out of both of those segments. It's a little early to tell which one is going to grow better in 2015, but we would expect solid growth from both of them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Can you talk a little bit about your store concentration in some of the areas or states that, from a real estate perspective, might face some difficulties with the reduction in oil prices?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes. So Vincent, our store concentration, we've shared that density map with the investment community. I think it's up on the website. You can pull it down and take a look at it. Obviously, you'll see Texas is a strong state for us, as is Oklahoma. Those are 2 markets where oil matters. I think in our comments we made the notion that even in the oil-rich states, we're seeing good demand for our products. The residential repaint activities, which are still not running at kind of a normalized level, we think will continue to carry through, even though there might be a little softness in some of these oil numbers. But as Bob has commented, it's a little bit early to see the full impact of that. But we're not expecting or anticipating any fall off on the kind of guidance we're giving for those reasons.", "Vincent Andrews - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just as a follow-up. Year-over-year, with the winter we had last year versus what we had this year, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of sort of comparisons, not knowing what the weather is going to be for the next several months, but is there anything we need to be thinking about there?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Well, if you're living in New York or Boston today, you need to be thinking about a snow shovel, I would imagine, and it's pretty ugly in Cleveland right now. So our comment on winter has been pretty consistent for the last several decades, is there are going to be pockets in our country that are going to have really ugly stretches here. We'll have stores that will be closed. We'll have customers that are unable to get out and do the amount of work that they had planned to do. But that's just kind of embedded in the fourth quarter and our expectations. We're blessed with an industry which really catches up well in the second and third quarter. So we're not giving any kind of indication that winter weather will ever have an impact here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan Chase.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "When you look across your customer base, which parts of your customer base are more aggressive about trying to capture some of falling raw materials? And which parts of your customer base are less aggressive about trying to capture those lower values?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, so I think it's fair to say, Jeff, that all of our customers are smart businesspeople. They pay close attention. In the case of the professional painting contractors, their focus has primarily been on ensuring that they have enough labor to complete the strong demand that they have for their products right now. So we're holding pricing this year. We've made that announcement earlier that we were not raising prices. That activity has been well received by them. And we don't expect, as we have in the past, that these raw material fallbacks occasionally, like we're seeing right now, will impact our selling prices at all.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "What about in the Consumer segment. Is -- are the attitude -- or are the attitudes of the retailers much different than the attitudes of the paint contractors?", "Christopher M. Connor", "We don't comment on any one specific customer in that segment, as you know, Jeff. And again, we would just -- would say the same thing. They're paying close attention. They want outstanding products and outstanding service at a fair value, and we're working hard to provide that every day.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "It's Dan Jester on for P.J. So if I remember correctly, typically, your store openings have been back-end loaded throughout the year. But I think in early 2014, you had stated that you were going to try to maybe make it a little bit more even throughout the year, but in the end, it was still a little bit back-end loaded. So as we think about this 100 to 110 new stores this year, is it still going to be back-end loaded in 2015? Or any chance that it's going to be a little bit more even throughout the year?", "John G. Morikis", "Dan, I wish you could see the smile on my face. We try to level-load those every year, and we push hard to do that, and we'll be pushing again this year to do that. We've got a terrific real estate team and a good market out there. We're working hard to spread those out a little more evenly, but we'll get them in as best as we can in the right locations at a great price.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then on foreign exchange and Latin America specifically, it still looks like foreign exchange is going to be a big headwind going into the first half of 2015. So is there anything you can do to kind of accelerate improvement in that business? Or is that something we just have to wait out until currency moves in a better direction?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think that when it comes to improving our cash flows and doing hedges, we can do that on the balance sheet side and the cash flow side. But on the sales side, there's nowhere to run. I mean, when you start to see Mexico right now at 14x, 14.5x, and then last year, we're in about the 12.60, there's really nothing -- nowhere you can hide when it comes to sales. But we're doing everything we can to mitigate the cash flow. But in -- operationally, we continue to work on that and that's -- and I think when you see more of a flattening of the foreign currency, then you're going to be able to see the improvements there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "A question around kind of each of your architectural competitors here in the U.S., so Masco, Valspar, PPG have all had a fairly sizable announcement around contractor business through one of the big boxes in, call it, the last 18 months or so, which seems to be a bigger push than we've seen historically. Do you see any difference in the way they're approaching that market where they may have more success than efforts like that have had in the past? Or is there a splintering of that contract or subsegment that may make them more likely to use the big boxes going forward?", "John G. Morikis", "Duffy, we've seen a number of initiatives over the years. And quite frankly, our focus is on really executing our strategy. We love our model. We love the relationships that we have. And we're continuing to build on what we believe are the right things. And most importantly is just understanding that customer and building a relationship and the products and services that they need, having the right people, the best people in the industry that are partners with those people. So I'm respectful of all of our competitors. I think they keep us honest. We're blessed to have good competitors. But we've got a lot of confidence in what we're doing, and we're going to continue to do it and try to get better every day.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then just 2 questions about the international market. One, with what happened in Mexico with Comex, has your existing business down there suffered at all from any of the maturations that happened around that, number one. And then two, just with where currencies have gone, would purchasing foreign assets be more attractive today than maybe it was a year ago for you guys?", "Christopher M. Connor", "So Duffy, on the Latin American business, we made the comment that in local currency, we actually generated sales gains, both in the quarter and for the year. And I think that the relative softness in that, while they were positive, they weren't robust, really speaks more to the broader economic environment in the big economies of Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Chile than perhaps any things that were happening in the industry. Those are the issues that we need to get on top of and address and fix going forward.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And when you asked about the acquisitions, the way we do it is we look at after-tax discounted cash flows. If we can get our cash back operationally and it's a good business, we really don't worry about the instantaneous or the current exchange rate. And I'll tell you why. A lot of times when we go into these countries, we don't put our cash in there, we actually will borrow in local currency to create a natural hedge. We try to do that as much as possible, and let the operation pay that note off. So we're more interested in what we can do with that business and with the long-term business, not the instantaneous foreign exchange conversion rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "So I wanted to ask you just on the math around inputs. So we know that your gross margins are 46%, which means that your cost of sales are 54%. If 85% of that is raw materials, that's about 45% of the house of revenues that's raws. I think you've said in the past that a 10-point move in oil is about a 1% change in the underlying inputs. So if we've got a 40% change in oil, I'm kind of getting about 150 basis point accretion to the total which would be over $1 in earnings. So I'm just wondering what I'm missing in the math or where we're reinvesting along the way.", "Robert J. Wells", "Aram, we mentioned when we cited that 10% versus the slightly less than 1% relationship between crude and our raw material basket, that, that was an older analysis. And what we've done is gone back and not just looked at the input -- or the impact of crude, but the impact of crude oil derivatives like propylene and ethylene. And propylene and ethylene are really the key inputs for the resin basket, which is about 40% of the raw material basket. And what we've found is that in broad terms, a 10% reduction in propylene would result in about -- I'm sorry, a $0.10 reduction in propylene would result in about a $0.015 decline in the price of a pound of latex, $0.015 to $0.02 decline. And the same relationship with a $0.10 decline in ethylene, you'd have about a $0.01 decline in the price of a pound of latex. So we've updated the guidance. It's not quite as sensitive to crude oil as it was when we did the last analysis. We also get some benefit in the alkyd resin basket and in solvents, so -- which would, too, would be roughly a 10% move in crude, would be a 0.2% move in the raw material basket from those 2 inputs. The point being, there's a lot of moving parts. It's just not quite as sensitive as it was when we did the old analysis, largely because we don't use as many petrochemical inputs as we used to.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "And Aram, when you talk about the dollar and you look at -- we move the guidance mid-point from $10.75 to $11, we had raw material goodness in the $10.75. We didn't have 0, and now what we're doing is putting 100% of it to get to $11. The $10.75, so when you look at $8.78 to the mid-point of $11, that's $2.22, over 25%, one of the largest increases we've ever put out here as a company. So the -- we weren't saying that 100% of the raw material goodness was taken up from $10.75 to $11. What we said is $10.75 to $11 was driven by the difference of what our view is of raw materials from December 12 until today.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "And was that kind of flat to now down low singles? Was that the change?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I don't think we're going to get to that detail of going from our guidance on December 12 until today to show you all the puts and takes in each one of the gross margin or SG&A or even conversion rates, foreign currency.", "Aram Rubinson - Wolfe Research, LLC", "And my follow-up, if it's all right, is just in the Paint Stores Group. We tried to back out Comex just to see what the legacy stores were doing, and it looks like you guys are kind of pushing about 19% segment margins in the core Sherwin-Williams Paint Stores Group. And I just wasn't sure if that trajectory still had some legs to it or if you had designs on kind of capping that at some point. Any thoughts on that?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, we really don't have any ideas on capping it. And one of the things about it, what we've said, Aram, is with the larger the gallon gains, that more flow-through we're going to have. So we had a very good gallon year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Looking at the numbers, it looks like Comex was less dilutive. It looks like it was actually breakeven in the fourth quarter. And I think your previous guide, it kind of implied it was about a 10% -- or excuse me, $0.10 headwind. So I guess what came out better than expected? Was it just the costs weren't there? Or are the assets actually performing better that you thought? And I guess how should we be thinking about the Comex add as we look to '15 then?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "All right, John, we lost $0.10 in Comex in the fourth quarter. I think that the reason you might be looking at it that way is if you think about the comments that John made about the full year, Consumer was relatively flat. I think that you have to take a look at some of that losses, it was in the Consumer Group for some of the -- from some of the product lines that they've -- they acquired there. But in total, the company lost $0.10 a share, right on the forecast.", "John P. McNulty - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And then just one last question. On the Lowe's ramp-up and the costs around that, do you recoup those or do you catch up on them at any point this year? Or is it more of a 2016 time frame, when you kind of get the margins in Consumer back to normal?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes. I would tell you this that, again, we're going to have expenses in all 4 quarters for Lowe's. We're going to have sales mostly in the last 3. We do catch up for the calendar year 2015. It's very, very slightly accretive. But it's -- really, 2016 is when we feel we'll see the lion's share of that accretion.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I think you spoke to this partially, but I was wondering if you could perhaps walk us through some of the macro assumptions that you're embedding in your 2015 EPS range of $10.90 to $11.10 in terms of perhaps existing home sales, starts, nonres and maybe most notably FX, where you're marking that?", "Robert J. Wells", "Yes, Kevin, we -- this is Bob again. We didn't really tie our guidance to any particular metric in existing home sales or starts. We start from the standpoint that 75% to 80% of the residential market -- paint sold into the residential market is used to repaint existing structures. Only part of that is sold by existing -- is driven by existing home turnover. We do think turnover will be higher in '15 than it was in '14. We certainly saw an upward inflection in existing home sales in the fourth quarter. And we think that bodes well for the coming year. We also saw that in starts, a little stronger new home sales and starts numbers later in the year. So we feel we have a lot of momentum going into 2015. Importantly, if you look at inventories of both new and existing homes, they are at 5.5 and 4.5 months' supply, respectively, which are well below where both of those metrics should be. So we have some catch-up on the inventory side in new homes. We think that as inventory comes into the market in existing homes, it's going to drive that -- drive sales stronger. And then in addition to that, there is the whole nonresidential piece which we see as picking up as well.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And presumably on the currency, you're just marking it recent days. Is that fair?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, I think when you take a look at it, especially the way currency really drove down in the fourth quarter, I think that we do -- our forecast is we're going to have a headwind, a significant headwind, especially in the first 3 quarters.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then a second one. I apologize if I missed this, but did you size the expenses in the quarter in Consumer related to the operating cost on HGTV HOME?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "No, we did not. Again, we're not going to do a P&L by customer or rank anything out to that finite when it comes to any one single customer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "On SG&A, it grew a little bit more year-on-year than it has in the past. And just curious if this is sort of a new level to expect? Or do you expect the SG&A growth to sort of moderate in '15 and '16?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. I think that this year, our SG&A was up 0.003%, really driven by Comex stores and the Comex acquisition. We were pretty upfront saying that, that was going to happen. As the integration continues to happen, we aren't -- we also did -- we've done some work -- we've been pretty public about some IT investments that we're making. But going forward, we see a reduction in our SG&A expense as a percent of sales.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Limited, Research Division", "Got it. And then just on LatAm, I'm noticing some, this year, some closures. And historically, Sherwin has, even in downturns, has sort of grown its store base. So curious as to -- is this a function of a different view on LatAm macro? Or is it rightsizing your asset base? Just why there's been a retrenchment in stores versus the normal Sherwin strategy to grow?", "John G. Morikis", "That's not our strategy. I'm not quite sure where you're getting the data closing...", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, we did have a couple of closings of some -- down in a few countries such as Brazil, but it was -- it had more to do with just what we're going to do in that local, very local market, not a strategy for other countries.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Chris, I think a quick and easy one, because most of the good questions have been taken. But have you guys noticed yet, detected any sense of enhanced or improved consumer-buying behavior in light of the sort of tax relief on fuel costs?", "Christopher M. Connor", "No, and we wouldn't see that in the fourth or first quarter, Bob. As you know, those are the slow quarters for the industry. We've seen pretty strong consumer purchasing throughout the year, driven by pent-up demand, better home values, all the other metrics that we've been talking about. When we get into the start of the spring painting season, if oil prices are still here and it costs a little less to fill up your car, maybe that will have a little bit of a lift impact as well, too. But regardless of that, we're giving guidance that we expect this to be a good year.", "Robert A. Koort - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And Sean, I think you'd said you're getting the expense burden for the HGTV and then most of the revenue benefit rolls in, starting in the second quarter. Do you actually get a sellthrough when you place that inventory? Or is it only as the retailer books the consumer sale?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. I mean, when they'd have a sale and they reorder, then we definitely have a sale to them.", "John G. Morikis", "We book the sale when we ship to Lowe's.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "So I really don't want to get too specific on that -- the load-in costs in the first quarter, but how should we think about the segment margin there, either relative to the fourth quarter or relative to year-over-year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "I think that you're going to see our -- in the first quarter, our Consumer Group margin will be lower. And it'll be lower because of the load-in -- the costs that we have. For the full year, we think it's going to be -- as I've said, you're going to see very little effect of the Lowe's business being depressive on the margin for the Consumer Group.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "And when you say lower, Sean, you're saying sequentially lower or year-over-year lower?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Year-over-year, I'm sorry.", "Dennis McGill - Zelman & Associates, LLC", "Okay. And Chris, it seems like other than maybe some -- some of the international uncertainty in currency, the domestic market, you feel pretty good about. Is there anything domestically that on the margin you see as a higher risk to the business or something that you're keeping a particularly close eye on?", "Christopher M. Connor", "I think Bob's taken you through a couple of the important end-market data points we look at. We've talked in this call, Dennis, for a number of years, about the lagging commercial or institutional construction market, which looks better to us heading into this year than it has for the last 7 years. We've commented on residential, and no one knows that better than you what that's potential will look like, and the existing home maintenance schedules look strong as well. And finally, just to piggyback on John's earlier comments about the anecdotal conversations we're having with our painters, who have got as book of business as strong as they've had in a while. So from a domestic architectural platform, 2015 should be a good year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Just one quick bookkeeping question, what's the tax rate guidance for 2015 as far us on the P&L, not -- the effective tax rate, not the cash tax?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. The effective tax rate should be in that low 30s. We had a pretty good -- the last 2 years. And that's why in John's comments, he told you what the tax rate was. It was in the 32s without the Comex acquisition. We're going to be in that ballpark.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So about 32%, 33%, something like that. And you talked a little bit about Latin America and kind of how you're viewing things there. Can you talk -- I mean, I know Europe is not a big market for you yet, but I'm sure it's something that you look at carefully, both from an M&A perspective as well as the growth of the businesses that you do acquire over time. We've heard some companies talk about the second half of the year maybe being a little bit stronger on lower gas pricing and more money in the pocket of consumers, so to speak, and maybe a little bit more competitive industrial economy, given the deflation in both the currency and the crude oil. Sort of what's your view of the businesses, particularly in the industrial side of the Coatings business, where you're at in Europe, on that region for 2015?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, Dmitry. So as you know, our exposure to Europe is almost entirely industrial coatings and weighted towards industrial wood finish coatings. A lot of those customers are manufacturing products that then get exported out of that region as well, too. So we've commented historically about our low share position. Despite some rougher economic environments, we expect to make progress, given that position. We've got good technology and a good team on the ground. We've worked hard to solidify and improve our operations. You've seen that in the global group margins. Coming up, a lot of that's been worked on Europe, and our expectations are that we'll have a positive growing year in Europe as well.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. One of the segments that has been sort of depressed for a long period of time, really, since the 2008, 2009 recession, and showed some signs of coming out in 2014, and I was just wondering what your outlook on that would be for 2015, was the marine and protective business. There is a couple of companies with exposure to it in the group of companies that I cover that's looked to be sounding a little bit more bullish about marine and protective, especially. You've grown through this downturn with your business. How do you view it going into 2015?", "John G. Morikis", "Well, I'd say it's going to be choppy, which is appropriate for a marine response, I suppose. But as we look forward, we play a niche market -- play in the niche market there. We kind of carve out our space. And again, just as we've described in other markets where our market share overall is lower, we've got plenty of opportunity to grow regardless of the market. So I think overall, there's going to be some ups and downs there, but we feel as though there is still opportunity for us to grow.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "I had a couple of follow-up questions, really getting to the Paint Stores Group. You mentioned, I think, volume for the industry you thought was up 3.5x and you were 2x that for the year. How did the fourth quarter play out in terms of volume versus mix and price?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "It was pretty -- I would say, it was very comparable to that. I mean, we saw -- the numbers were -- we're starting to see the Comex stores come into the comp stores in the fourth quarter. And you're seeing that. That was a little depressive. But in total, we still -- we sit there and feel that we were probably still growing twice the market in the fourth quarter.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "And is it fair then to say that there was a point or 2 of mix and price as well in that, that 7.5?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, yes. Yes.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "Perfect. And then the second and I -- just a little bit of a housekeeping one. When you have the $0.16 share charge, does that include -- is that the net effect, including the titanium dioxide settlements? Or is that different from the $0.16?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "The $0.16...", "Robert J. Wells", "Well, it was $22 million for the titanium dioxide -- or I'm sorry. Pardon me.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. Yes. When you -- I'm trying to remember where that $20 million -- when we had the titanium dioxide which was $21 million, we had to net that for taxes. So that's where the $0.16 comes from.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "Got it. And then lastly, and at the risk of going back to this one more time, so I make sure I heard it clearly, the start-up costs for the HGTV Lowe's program was basically the only reason for the Consumer margin decline in the fourth quarter.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI, Research Division", "And it sounds like you expect a similar pressure in the first quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Could you, Sean, just repeat, to start off with, the 2015 CapEx number? I missed it before when you were giving us those numbers.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, in the $240 million. And again, that's really being driven by the refurbishment of the Comex stores.", "Charles Edward Cerankosky - Northcoast Research", "Okay. Great. And then yes, my next question is about Comex. Sean, how do you expect their contribution in 2015 to phase into the quarterly earnings space? They lost some money in the fourth quarter. Are they suddenly profitable in the first? Or how do you see that shaping up?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "When we look at it, we talked about the $0.10 a share, I would say that we're looking that in the first and fourth quarter, we'll be slightly negative. And in the second and third quarter, we're going to make probably 10-plus in those 2 quarters. And I would say it's about even between the second and third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "When I look at the Brazilian real last year, it actually rallied in the late spring and into the summer. Is the most difficult currency comp going to be in the second quarter? The fourth quarter was $0.09. Are we looking at materially above $0.09 when we get on to the second quarter this year?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right. When you were talking about the Brazilian real, if you look at it, it was in the 2.22, 2.23 to 1. That's really going to be the biggest hurdle for us in the year 2015. In the first quarter, it was closer to the 2.40. So the 2.65 versus 2.40. If it stays at 2.65, it's 2.65 versus that 2.22, 2.23 in the second quarter last year.", "John Roberts - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then the earlier question about low gasoline prices potentially stimulating consumer demand, I mean, the outdoor market is what seasonally picks up later in the year, which would be much less consumer that's there. The consumer market would be mostly indoor, and I would think you would see some signs of that here during the winter as well, if that was going to happen.", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, that's accurate that the indoor market is -- or the interior paint market is more of a 12-month than the exterior one for sure. But if you look at our traditional sales bell curve, we're going to see, even in pickup and interior gallons in the second and third quarter. I think the reality is, is that we're having terrific gallon performance this year through those stores. So is the reaction because oil prices are lower or because people have more confidence and home values are up, it's just time to repaint? We're not smart enough to put our finger on exactly what it is. We're just out there working hard to get every one of those incremental gallons as we can.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "One question on Comex. Could you remind us of the earnings impact of that business in '14, and then '15 and '16? And you can frame it on an earnings or on a margin basis, but curious on where that is pacing. You also seemed to indicate that it's still comping below the core, and I'm curious on your expectation of how that would work its way through the system and what your outlook is for that.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, Eric. We lost $0.02 in the third quarter 2013. We lost $0.11 in the fourth quarter 2013. So we lost $0.13 in the calendar year 2013. This year, we lost $0.28, $0.10 of which was in the fourth quarter. So we lost $0.18 in the first 3 quarters. So really, when you look at that $0.11 in the fourth quarter of 2013, $0.10 this year, it was relatively flat. We've said that we're going to make $0.10. Now we have annualized this acquisition, and that's pretty much the amount of color that we're really going to give. I think as it becomes a higher degree of integration, it's harder to actually pinpoint the exact numbers. But to give you any more color around sales going forward in '16 or '17, we're just not going to be able to do it.", "John G. Morikis", "I think, Eric, as you know, our strategy moving forward, as they become a Sherwin-Williams store, those products are going to be available. Those customers are using those accounts already in different stores. So our strategy is to make that more of a customer-efficient store. And that means more Sherwin products available in any of the stores, including those that are acquired through Comex.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Company", "I think that -- and that's helpful. I think the vision -- or in the past, the thinking was that it would get to a comparable margin as the stores grew up, an upper teens margin. It felt like that was kind of a '16 event. Is that still the way we should think about it? Or -- and I understand it's now consolidated within the business, but how we should we think about where the margin is going?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, I think that's a very good way to think about it. By '16, these stores will have been in our family now for 2.5, 3 years, and that's when they're running at a core level.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence.", "Christopher Perrella", "How many of the Comex stores are left to refurbish at this point? And how should I think about run rate CapEx next year...", "Christopher M. Connor", "Yes, we have about -- of the 306 we acquired, we have 294 still. That looks like a good number going forward. We had about 1/3 of them converted this year. So just shy of 200 yet to go.", "Christopher Perrella", "All right. And what should CapEx be when it returns to normal, I guess, as a percent of sales in 2016?", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Well, I think we've always run this company around 1.5%. I think that 1.5% to 2% is probably a pretty good long-term number.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Talking about the consumer savings from lower fuel costs, would any of that show up in the Finishes Group? I'm thinking wood treatment cabinets, home appliances, would you see any of that?", "Christopher M. Connor", "Sure, if we were able to have the laser vision to see through the consumer's incentive for purchasing, if they felt a little more confident to make furniture purchases, to your point, floor covering purchases, expansions of their properties, all those things would have an impact in the coatings demand.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay. And second thing, I guess I'm confused about the Comex, because my press release says it lost $0.18 a share in 2014. And I guess I'm confused.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Yes, that was the first 3 quarters. And I think in the press release, I remember the $0.18 also. I think that, that was an incremental $0.18. So when you were looking at that $0.28 versus last year, I guess it's because the share count changes. When I gave Eric the number of 2 plus 11, that was a 1 share count number. And this year, it was the $0.28 at a different share count. So the difference was $0.18 one year over the other.", "Richard O'Reilly", "Okay. Fine. So you had $0.28, okay, versus '13. Okay. Fine. But the press release uses an $0.18 number for the full year. Okay.", "Sean P. Hennessy", "Right.", "Operator", "Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back over to Bob Wells for closing remarks.", "Robert J. Wells", "Thank you again, Roya.

Welcome to Valspar's First Quarter Fiscal 2015 Conference Call. And as a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to your host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Bill Seymour. Please go ahead.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2015 first quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today, Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements which are subject to risk and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com.", "Also please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release. And finally we have posted a new supplemental slide presentation to the IR site, which includes commentary on our first quarter results and historical data for fiscal 2014. We will provide this in future quarters as well. With that, I will turn the call over to Gary.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today I'll cover some of the highlights of our first quarter performance. Jim will then provide some additional details on the quarter's financials and our outlook for the year. We're pleased to report a good start to the year. Sales increased 4% and adjusted EPS was up 21%. These results reflect continued growth in both sales and profitability in our Coatings segment, benefits from new business wins, strong performance from China and the positive impact of our ongoing productivity initiatives.", "Like most multinational companies in the U.S., the strengthening of the U.S. dollar impacted our results for the quarter. Q1 sales growth in local currency was up 7%. We've not changed the full year outlook in local currency terms, but the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar has led us to modestly revise our sales outlook for 2015. Jim will take you through that later.", "Now I'll cover some specific highlights for the quarter. I'll start with our Coatings segment, which had another very strong quarter. In fact all product lines and regions grew both volume and sales even with the currency headwinds. EBIT in our Coatings segment also increased significantly in the quarter as a result of leveraging higher volumes and internal productivity initiatives. Some highlights include very strong volume growth in our general industrial and wood product lines driven by new business wins and market share gains. Our coil product line also benefited from new business wins. In our packaging product line, we continue to grow our sales and market share in all regions and in the non-BPA segment of the market. Looking at our Coatings segment from a geographic point of view, all regions grew, with growth in China being particularly strong.", "Turning now to our Paints segment, volumes increased and sales were up modestly in local currency. Strong volume growth in our international regions was partially offset by the expected softness in North America. So let me provide a little bit of additional context on Paints sales in Q1. As you may recall, we had a very good first quarter in the Paints segment in 2014, when total Paints sales were up 10%. This growth was driven by the rollout of Valspar-branded paint at Ace Hardware. And our paint business in China was up more than 30% in the first quarter last year.", "In the quarter we just completed, we faced those tough comparisons and we also began to see the impact from the previously disclosed adjustment to our product line offering at Lowe's. That being said, our international regions in Paints performed very well. As I mentioned earlier, our overall business in China was strong and our paint business was no exception.", "Volumes in China were up almost 10% against the extremely strong comparisons in 2014. In the UK and Ireland, the Valspar Paint program has now been set in all 350 B&Q stores. And during the quarter, we began shipping to B&Q from Europe as a result of a recently completed manufacturing agreement. We're excited to be in all stores, and we'll begin our advertising program as we move into the spring.", "In Australia, we continue to see good growth at both Masters and the Pro channel. At Masters we're benefiting from strong sell through of new products and Master store growth. In our trade business, sales to professional painters were up in the high single-digits in the quarter in local currency, and we continue to grow share in this channel.", "Into North America, we're looking forward to the first full year with Ace Hardware. In addition of Valspar being Ace's national paint brand, Ace has recently chosen Cabot as their national stain brand. Cabot will now be available in over 1,500 Ace stores starting in the spring. In the North America home improvement channel, we're looking forward to the paint season and growing the Valspar brand of a reset base. We continue to have a very strong product line up at Lowe's that spans price points and categories. At the high end, Valspar Reserve continues to sell very well and in the Pro category, we continue to make inroads. We have an excellent relationship with Lowe's and look forward to continuing the successful growth of the Valspar Paint brand in this channel.", "So in summary, we're pleased with the solid start and are optimistic about the rest of the year. Our first quarter results once again demonstrates the diversity and strength of our business portfolio.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide more details on the results and outlook.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Gary and good morning everyone. I will review our first quarter performance and discuss our expectations for the balance of fiscal 2015. I'll focus my comments this morning on the key drivers in the quarter. As Bill noted, we've posted some additional details on our segments and product line performance on our website. Starting first with our Q1 performance highlights, sales increased 4% and volumes were up 7%. The impact of FX lowered sales by approximately 3% in the quarter. Sales improved 7% in local currency.", "Our Coatings segment delivered a very good quarter. Segment sales increased 7% and grew 10% in local currency. Volumes increased 10% in the quarter and reflected improved momentum from Q4, when Coating volumes were up 5%, excluding the impact of the 53rd week. Volume was up in all Coatings product lines. General industrial sales and volumes were up double-digits, driven primarily by new business wins in Asia and in the U.S. Wood product line sales and volumes were also up double-digits in the first quarter. This growth was the result of new business wins and market share gains within the Asia market.", "The coil product line had another strong quarter with volumes and sales up mid-single digits. Growth in coil was also driven by new business wins. The packaging product line also continued to grow with volumes and sales up mid-single digits in the quarter. Sales in local currency were up high-single digits, reflecting solid growth in all regions.", "Moving on to the Paints segment, total sales decreased 1%, but sales were up 2% in local currency. Total volumes increased 5% driven by double-digit volume increases in China, Australia and Europe. China growth was driven by market share gains in the non-exclusive retail channel, where we increased our distribution points by 1,400 locations.", "In Australia, volume growth was driven by growth at Masters, and in our stores business. And in Europe, the significant volume growth was driven by the rollout of Valspar Paint across the remaining B&Q stores. The increased volume from international was partially offset by a single digit decline in North America. This decline was the result of the two items that Gary touched on earlier. First, we had very difficult comparisons to Q1 last year when North America Paint volumes were up over 15%. These very strong results included the initial shipments of Valspar-branded Paints to Ace in the first quarter of last year.", "Second, in Q1 this year, we began to experience the impact of the adjustment to our product line offering at Lowe's. Both of these factors were included in our plan assumptions for the year. In Q2, the difficult comparisons will continue, given the new product rollouts to Ace Hardware and from the launch of Valspar Reserve last year. In addition, the impact from the adjustment in our product line offering at Lowe's will increase in the balance of the year as this transition fully occurs.", "Moving on to gross margin, we finished the quarter with total adjusted gross margin of 34.1%, essentially flat to last year. Improvements from productivity initiatives and leverage from higher volume were offset by unfavorable product mix, primarily in the Paints segment. Looking at expenses in Q1, adjusted OpEx in the first quarter decreased 40 basis points to 22.4% of sales. Operating expense dollars increased 2%, driven by increases related to higher sales, partially offset by productivity initiatives and the impact of FX.", "Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 9% and EBIT margins increased 60 basis points to finish at 11.8% in the first quarter. In the Coatings segment, adjusted first quarter EBIT of $91 million increased 16%. The increase in EBIT was primarily the result of significantly higher volumes in the quarter, along with the benefits from our productivity initiatives.", "In the Paints segment, adjusted EBIT of $29 million was down 16% from the prior year. As I discussed earlier, our Paints segment was up against a difficult comparison to last year, when sales were up 10% and EBIT was up 50%. The decrease in EBIT in the first quarter of this year, was primarily driven by the impact of the initial shipments of Valspar at Ace and very strong results in China last year. Q1 EBIT was also impacted by the customer product line adjustments that I referenced earlier.", "Moving on to a couple of other items in the quarter, our Q1 adjusted tax rate of approximately 29.5% improved 340 basis points driven primarily by favorable tax credits and the geographic mix of our earnings. We continue to expect that our annual tax rate will be between 31% and 32% for fiscal 2015. Q1 reported results included a pre-tax gain on the sale of assets of approximately $48 million. This gain was from the sale of assets, primarily IP, related to a non-strategic product in our Coatings segment. The gain has been excluded from our adjusted results for Q1. This sale will have an insignificant impact on sales and operating results in the fiscal year.", "On our Q4 call, we discussed plans to issue new long-term debt in fiscal 2015. In the first quarter, we issued $500 million of debt, which included $250 million in 10-year notes and $250 million in 30-year notes. As a reminder, our fiscal 2015 guidance reflects approximately $75 million in annual interest expense.", "Wrapping up the highlights for the quarter, we paid $25 million of dividends representing a per share increase of 15% and repurchased 983,000 shares of our company stock for a total investment of $84 million.", "With this as context on Q1, let's move on and discuss the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2015. We continue to expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65. Let me provide you a little more color on a few components of this guidance. First, as you saw on the release today, we modestly lowered our annual sales guidance to approximately flat sales compared to fiscal 2014. This compares to our previous guidance of growth in the low single-digits. This adjustment reflects the impact of a stronger dollar on our sales outside the U.S. As you know, over the past few months the U.S. dollar has strengthened against many key currencies. The assumptions utilized in our original guidance from November did not reflect these recent changes.", "Second, in terms of phasing for the year, our plans continued to reflect that the Paints segment will be up against more challenging comparisons in the second quarter from the continued rollout of both Valspar Paint at Ace and the launch of Valspar Reserve last year and from the product line changes at Lowe's. In closing, our Q1 results reflect strong performance and execution. It's early in the year, but we're off to a good start and remained focused on delivering on our full-year performance goals.", "With that we'd like to open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We'll first go to the line of Michael Klein with Piper Jaffray. Go ahead.", "Michael A. Klein - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi. Good morning. General industrial grew faster than the market, can you talk about what you're seeing in the end-markets to support continued growth and maybe provide some color around the types of productivity initiatives that we can expect as the year progresses?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Mike, it's Gary. Good morning. Yes, we had a really strong quarter in general industrial, which followed a good year last year. So we're seeing good growth in our pipe business, our partnership with Maersk in container is proceeding well and that plant in China is up running full time. And we also saw extremely good growth in the construction and off-road segment in China. So China was a pretty significant driver of the really solid results that we saw in general industrial, as well as I mentioned the pipe coatings globally.", "So we are always \u2013 relative to productivity, I mean I can't give you a \u2013 I won't you give a specific comment except to say that every one of our product lines and businesses has productivity goals for the year, and there is a whole spectrum of things that they could do to achieve that productivity from restructuring on the one hand through many other activities around Lean Six Sigma. So productivity, we have a saying at Valspar that it's productivity forever and there are many, many things that are aggregated into that catch phrase.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Mike, it's Jim. Just to add on to Gary's comments, from a productivity standpoint, you may recall, we did some restructuring activities last year that were provided as a result of the Inver opportunity. So in the general industrial business, we're able to lower some of our manufacturing cost with those restructuring activities, and that's some of the benefits that we're realizing in the P&L now.", "Michael A. Klein - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Sure. Okay. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, can you talk about the impact from low oil prices and how much of the potential benefit you think you can capture? I don't think you have many long-term sales contracts in Coatings. So I would assume those conversations are pretty fluid with customers?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, to the last part of your question, I mean it's a natural question for a customer to ask, given the headline of crude prices that are substantially lower than they were. But I'll say this, in Q1 we saw de minimis raw material benefits. The reason for that is that our raw material basket is not weighted heavily to oil based materials, and in fact only a small portion of our basket is linked directly to oil. We buy complex chemistries that are well down the process and value stream from crude oil. So supply and demand is much more determinant of our raw material cost than the price of crude. Even the relatively small amount of materials linked to crude, there's a lag between the price of crude declining and a price change in the downstream commodity. So that's the past up until now. Looking forward for the balance of the year, we would expect to see a modest benefit if a lower oil price is sustained and the way we're thinking about that is potentially a low single-digit decline in overall basket for the rest of the year.", "Michael A. Klein - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next we go to the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital. Go ahead please.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I had, so you mentioned a lot about new business wins. How much of your growth was driven by I guess new business wins versus organic if there is any way to split it out?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know Ivan. We have a metric that we track internally, which we call net new business, which is business won by business lost. And in the quarter that number was approaching high single-digits for us. So how much of that is organic growth and how of it is new, it's really hard to tell with thousands of customers. But my guess is, it's maybe 5% of it was new business and 2% was market, something like that.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then, Jim, you mentioned when you gave your outlook in November about FX being an impact on EBIT. So how much has that increased? And how much did you see it impact I guess in the quarter and now sort of your outlook for the full year versus when you gave the guidance in November?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Sure. Well, if you recall back in November, Ivan, we talked about the impact of FX that was embedded in our guidance of roughly 2.5% to 3% for the year. As we look now and we see where rates have gone, that number is probably looking more like 4% to 5%. So as Gary mentioned, we felt it prudent to take down our top-line expectations for the year based on the expected changes in FX, but we're still marching due to the same local currency plans we have for sales in each of our businesses.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So is there not a change in your, I believe, you gave an EPS impact?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. Clearly there is a flow through impact to the bottom line as well that we partially factored into our guidance, but we're going to have a little bit more headwinds from that. In the big scheme of things, given the fact that we're only in the first quarter, we've got a lot of business in front of us for the balance of the year. And we've got a $0.20 range in our EPS guidance. We think it's prudent at this point in time just to let the business play out and we'll update our view of the year as we get more business behind us.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then last question, I'll jump back into queue. You mentioned that you're now sourcing supply from paint to go into B&Q. How much of a savings will that cause? And is it just basically a total agreement or did you have to build a plant or what's sort of the moving parts and how's that going to be impactful to B&Q's profitability going forward?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. It's a total agreement with a company in mainland Europe, Ivan. And I think we called it out. It's in the low single-digit millions of dollars in terms of freight savings that we'll achieve.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks a lot for taking my questions. I appreciate it.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Next we'll go to the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Good morning. Could you give us a quick tutorial what actually happened in France with the BPA coatings in January? And it looks like the UK and some others are trying to sue them. Have people actually rolled over to non-BPA on coatings? And is there a chance that that goes back, or can you kind of just layout what is actually happening around France and maybe the contagion to that other areas? Or does it get put back in the bottle at the end of the day?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Duffy, it's Gary. On January 1 of this year a ban went into effect in France. So there are no BPA based coatings on cans being sold in France today. And I'm actually not familiar with what you referenced in terms of someone suing. I hadn't heard that, so I'll just tell you a little bit more about what I do know. What I know is that a fairly significant part of the food and general line market and other segments in Europe have started the conversion to non-BPA coatings. And with respect to beverage, there's been some conversion of beverage containers to non-BPA coatings as well. So I think you may have called it a contagion. I don't know I'd go that far but people are, brand owners are switching their coatings from epoxy-based coatings to non-BPA coatings in a pretty significant way across most of the packaging segments in Europe.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And then, if you use that as a reference point, obviously you would have had some market share in the epoxy base before going to now the non-BPA or whatever the politically correct term is for it. How would your market shares compare kind of before and after in the sample set that we have so far?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Our market share on Europe it is materially higher than it was in the past.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you guys.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "In the segments that I just mentioned.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfect. Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we'll now move to line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead, please.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. And I appreciate the added disclosures and color in the slide that makes our lives a little easier.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Anything to make your life easy, Bob.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "What about \u2013 Gary, just what you are seeing on two counts around customer deferrals or maybe some deceleration; one, you mentioned raw materials haven't shown much relief for you yet. Is there a sense from your customers that maybe there could some coming? Have you seen any inventory destock in more raw material sensitive businesses? And then secondly, maybe across things like oil and gas and pipelines and maybe some of the end markets where there continues to be a little bit more challenge, have you seen any changes in order patterns there?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "No. the short answer is, no to both of your questions, Bob. I mean, it would be logical if crude pricing \u2013 natural gas pricing stays low for a long time, that you would see some projects laid off, but we certainly haven't seen that yet. And with your first question about supply chain, it looks like, most if not, all of our supply chains are behaving the way we would expect them to at this point in the year.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I think Gary you guys do sell some resins to other paint companies, adhesives companies, et cetera, have they demonstrated any behavior that would be consistent with expecting some help on pricing there?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. No, most of the paint companies are buying as we do. We don't buy inventory. We don't necessarily arbitrage the input costs versus carrying finished goods inventory. So I can't help you on this line of thinking because we just haven't seen it, Bob. Frankly I think it's because, as I mentioned when I answered Mike's question in the beginning is that we're not seeing a ton of change in our raw material basket yet. And I'm not certain that we will, and I think others are probably feeling the same way.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And if I might ask one last one, Jim you gave some indications that some of the year-on-year comps in North American paint were going to remain tough. How should we think about that relative to the year-on-year erosions you saw in the first quarter? Does it get greater, lesser? And how does it cycle through towards the end of the year?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. Bob, it's similar to my comments on the Q4 call. It's going to be more in Q2 for the following two reasons. We're going to continue to have the impact of the rollout that we did last year at Ace. We also loaded in some inventory at Ace last year in the second quarter to support promotional activities that they were announcing. And then you may recall we started to load in Valspar Reserve at Lowe's last year in the second quarter. So those two factors combined with the product line of change at Lowe's, we'll see a bigger impact of that in Q2 than we saw in Q1 because the transition was just starting at the end of Q1 on that product line.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. Thanks, Bob.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Dave Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Gary and Jim, given those headwinds in Q2, plus any weather impact potentially, could you grow earnings overall in Q2 year-over-year on EPS basis?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Hey Dave, its Jim. What we are focused on obviously is growing the business for the entire year. So we're going to be up against some challenges in Q2 in the Paints segment for the reasons that I just highlighted. So those challenges at this point aren't any greater than what we assumed in our planned guidance for the year. So we're going to have the most pressure on earnings in the second quarter for the top line items I talked about. But we're committed to delivering the year as originally outlined earlier based on what we see in the marketplace so far.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So would a flat year-over-year assumption for Q2 be reasonable?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Dave, we don't give quarterly earnings guidance. But what I'm trying to do is give you enough color, to shape your phasing to reflect the outcomes for the full year.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Understood. And just on your Coating margins year-over-year were very strong up 120 basis points roughly. Would you expect the similar progression in Coatings margins year-over-year for rest of the quarters?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. The margin growth in Coatings is really been driven by the favorability of the higher volumes that we're experiencing and also the benefit of the productivity and restructuring initiatives that I talked about earlier. So those initiatives are going to continue, as we move into the year. We'll have a little bit of comparison pressure as we get later in the year, because we made some of those restructuring moves at the end of last year, but you know on balance we continue to feel like we're going to have a very nice run this year in the Coatings business and drive EBIT growth.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Dave.", "Operator", "We'll now go to the line of PJ Juvekar with Citibank. Go ahead.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, hi. Good morning. So far you've talked about sort of limited raw material impact on your business. Gary, can you discuss how lower raw material prices impact each of your segments, sort of differentiate for us as it relates to the magnitude and timing on each segment?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm not going to do that PJ. As I said, we're not seeing it yet. So, I would be speculating \u2013 to answer that question will be pure speculation on my part. I said earlier that, I think that if we see sustained lower oil price and we're going to see some bleed through into our overall raw material basket in the low-single digits. But that's about as far as I think we can say at this point in time.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And can you talk about historically, last time, when oil prices went down, whether you...", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, that's interesting because the last time that we saw a decline like this was 2008-2009. And if you did the research, you probably have to model, you saw that margins for most coatings companies were up at that time, yet the interesting thing though is, you actually have to look back a little further than that and see that just prior to that big oil price decline, we had massive inflation in our raw material pricing and most coatings companies were out with pricing. I think the timing was such that pricing was hitting just as the price of oil was declining. And it may have looked to people like the margin expansion was due to a correction price of oil, when in fact that was not true. What was true was that pricing went through and improved coatings margins, at the same time that we randomly saw a reduction in the price of oil. So that's context. To answer your specific question, we would expect \u2013 I'll say it again this way, we would expect that if oil pricing remains depressed for a sustained period of time that we're going to see a modest benefit to our overall basket.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I can't say more than that now because we haven't seen, we haven't ever seen a period of time when the oil price stayed low for a long time. Even back in 2008-2009, it was more or less a V-shaped recovery, it dropped from wherever it was to about $40 and then it started climbing pretty rapidly after that.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Thank you for that. And just one more question from me on TiO2. The supplier seemed to be struggling with pricing, do you anticipate any pricing this year in TiO2? Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think TiO2 pricing is probably reached bottom and is pretty stable, and I don't expect any movement one way or another PJ.", "PJ Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird & Company. Go ahead please.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good morning. It's actually Mehul Dalia sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good. Thank you.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. The 10% volume growth in Coatings was impressive. How sustainable is that number, it seems like it was mostly driven by new business wins, but was there any one-offs in the quarter worth noting?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "No, no material one-offs, it's really a continuation of the strength we experienced last year and as we highlighted during our prepared remarks, each of our product lines within the Coatings segment contributed to that growth. So I would not call out a specific one-off in that mix.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. And I appreciate the color on the progress of B&Q. Has there been any pushback from competitors, any new competitors there just given your push into the European market?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean, the only place that they could push back would be B&Q and there was some promotional activity a while ago, but I don't think that we're seeing anything unusual.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. And then just one last one. Do you expect Paint volumes overall for the year to be positive regardless of the North America share loss, just because of international growth that you're seeing?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. Well, it's difficult to grow the total volumes in the business, given the change that we talked about in North America. What we're focused on obviously, is continuing to drive the positive growth that we see in our international markets, and we'll have to just play though the rest of paint season in the North American business. But volume growth overall, we're not expecting material volume growth in the Paints segment, as a result of the changes in North America.", "Mehul M. Dalia - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. Thanks for your questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. Can you remind me again, how much business on an annual basis you believe that you lost at Lowe's? And in the quarter, I imagine that this wasn't a stronger quarter because the transition is not entirely done. Can you sort of size how much that business was down in the quarter?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes, Jeff, it's Jim. Just to remind you that the original expectation for the year, when we laid out guidance, we said that the net impact of the changes in the product line at Lowe's, we estimated to be about $150 million to $180 million sales impact to the business. I'm not going to go through kind of the quarter-by-quarter build on that, but as you correctly noted, that transition really just started to happen at the end of Q1 and those product sets are going to start moving into the Lowe's stores. So we did see some impact, but the impact will be much greater in each of the next three quarters as that transition fully takes place.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Are Cabot stains being deemphasized at Lowe's, and is there some sort of trade-off between Cabot going down at Lowe's and going up at Ace?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, we don't sell Cabot at Lowe's, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, is there any \u2013 do you expect any sequential price decreases in your coatings business or do you think that that would be pretty flat in the scheme of things?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "In aggregate, I would expect that it would be pretty flat. As I said, those price reductions come around two ways generally through competitive situations, which I would say the competitive dynamic in most of our markets is as it usually is. There's nothing unusual about this year. And for raw material reductions, and as I said, we may see some modest raw material reductions and our customers may ask to participate in that, and in fact, we will have a constructive conversation about what's there.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, lastly what's the revenue impact of the asset sale or the intellectual property sale, if there was one for 2015?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes, Jeff, it's going to be really modest, probably a little less than $10 million.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "It was really a nonstrategic product line of the business.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks for your questions, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yes.", "Operator", "We'll go now to the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Go ahead.", "Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Just had a question on your paints mix. Price mix was down 3%. It looks like your price mix was actually positive in North America because sales were down less than volume. So is the negative price mix just the fact that as international sales grow, that tends to be at lower price points?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes, two things, Don. From a total Paints segment standpoint, biggest impact on price mix is that last year in the first quarter, we were selling in a much higher, richer mix of Valspar branded product at Ace, which has got higher price points. Second piece as you noted is as we have been successful in growing our international business, the price points on those products, especially in China, are lower than our average for the segment, so the combination of the two of those is what drove the negative price mix variance.", "Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "To follow-up on coatings, you mentioned the container initiative with Maersk. You haven't talked about that for a while. Where are we in that whole container coatings cycle? You had outlined quite a drop from peak to trough recently. Are we starting to see a recovery there or is it just that you're getting better economics with onsite manufacturing now?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Don, this is Gary. I don't think much has changed in terms of overall demand for containers. But with Maersk, we're up and running and that's a significant factory and it's a big factory, and it's consuming $30 million, $40 million worth of coatings on its own. And one interesting dynamic that's occurred is that the Chinese government has levied a tax on solvent-based materials in some areas where container manufacturers are operating, and we think that's a net benefit for us as our Aquaguard material is a water-based product. So there is a bit of renewed interest from some customers that we are not currently doing business with. They've been trialing our water-based material as a consequence of that solvent tax. So, we're still sanguine about the container industry in the long-term, but it's not robust at the moment.", "Don D. Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead please.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley", "Hi. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. To clarify, in regards to the guidance range being maintained, but full year sales are now expected to be lower than previously anticipated. I'm wondering if you could clarify how your perspective on margins might have changed. Is there any expectation of raw materials embedded at this point?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. Once again, it's Jim. It's early in the year. We took the top line down, just given the changes in FX. And just want to highlight, we're at the end of the first quarter. As we look at the full year and the various puts and takes we see from a business and macro standpoint, our view in total hasn't changed materially. We have enough levers at this point in time in the year to manage within the guidance range we have. And as we get more business behind us and see how all the lines of the P&L perform, we'll be in a better position to judge what the full year impact is going to be.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks. And then in regards to packaging, with some of your competitors taking more aggressive aim at non-BPA business inside of the can, I'm wondering if you've noticed any changes in the competitive landscape there. And then at what point would mean reversion be possible in terms of your multiple of growth to the overall can consumption?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "I mean anything is possible. But we feel very comfortable with our leadership position in non-BPA coatings. As I said earlier, our market share in Europe as an example was materially higher than it was before the start of the transition. So we feel like we're leading and we're not going to comment on this call specifically about competitors, but the packaging business is a large global segment. And there are others that would like to be in it, and would love to have the position that we have.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll go now to line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Go ahead.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just a follow-up on that last question. I mean you've been gaining share in packaging fairly consistently through this BPA transition, as well as before, and I understand not all the gains are BPA related. You're already a market leader, so it stands to reason that at some point your growth rate will start approximating more market growth rate. How long of a runway do you think you have in packaging, where you can continue to materially outperform the market and your competitors?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think, if you went back to \u2013 Dmitry, it's Gary. If you went back to our Investor Day when we talked about packaging, we are a global market leader. But we're not the market leader in Europe, and we're not the market leader in Asia and Europe. But we are the market leader in North America, but in those two other markets we're not. And those other two markets combined are much larger than the North America market. So we've got a very long runaway ahead of us, as this non-BPA transition occurs, and frankly as the packaging market continues to grow.", "Our business, in the quarter, in Asia as an example was up 20%, which is about two times, at least two times the market growth. And that's not a non-BPA market, that's an epoxy market. So we feel good about our packaging business. We've got positive volume growth for 10 quarters in a row, significant volume growth in the last three quarters or four quarters and we expect that to continue for a while.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Very good. Just kind of circle back on the Australian paint market. We had a little bit of a recovery I guess, after a couple of years of some housing issues. But now it's \u2013 at least from what I'm reading, it looks like the housing market may be losing steam a little bit there. Currency obviously is going to be a significant headwind for you. Is it possible for you to maintain, the growth rates, that you've seen in your Australian business and more importantly, are you getting sort of the needed leverage, from volumes, and margins to where you are, getting close to your double-digit intermediate goal for that business?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think most of the growth that we've seen over the last number of quarters, and it's been five quarters or six quarters now at least, we've seen positive volume growth in Australia, Dmitry, has been through Masters. And so, to think about two channels, a retail channel and a paint stores channel, those are our two main channels. And Masters continuous to build stores and we continue to win shelf space at Masters, and which we've been growing there.", "And then on our stores business, we did a lot of things, two years, three years and four years ago that shrunk the size of our business, but they were the right things to do, to get to the cost structure that we needed and the right store footprint. And we're now starting to see the benefit of the things that we did and we're growing off of that reset base. So, I would \u2013 as we said, our stores business was up high single digits this quarter. My guess is that, most of that is market share wins, not market growth.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. And as far as your margins goals in that business where are you versus sort of your plan, as you revised it and versus your long-term goals?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well. I would say that we're right on the glideslope.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "All right. Fair enough, Gary. One final question on general industrial, you talked about some of the strengths in the businesses including sort of the off-road and construction part of the market, agricultural and mining equipment markets continue to be fairly weak, they are \u2013 to my understanding, at least a meaningful portion of your general industrial business. Can you talk about what's going on there, sort of, both on year-over-year basis and sort of how the market feels going forward and what the upside could be, should that business recover in 2016?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, just to size it, Dmitry, that whole segment for us globally is about $125 million to $150 million segment, right. So it's reasonably big, but it's \u2013 we're a $4.5 billion company. So you've seen the headlines from our two main customers and they're projecting a pretty weak year ahead. We are going to feel the impact of that. But on the flip side, but they are not our only two customers. And so we're \u2013 we've had an initiative going on in China and in Europe post the Inver acquisition to expand our point of view on that whole market segment.", "And we're achieving some significant success both in China and in Europe, so in the quarter and last year in the face of declining agricultural equipment sales and construction equipment sales we are growing that business. So that's the way we think about it. We think that that team has got to grow through whatever weakness that occurs in that market, and we can do it, because we're not a huge player, $150 million is not significant in the context of a multibillion dollar overall global market.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay, but thanks for sizing that business, because that's \u2013 that answers my second part of the question on what the recovery there can do for you. Thanks, Gary. That's all I had.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question will be from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Go ahead, please.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thank you, and congratulation on a great first quarter.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Looking at packaging coatings, Gary, you had a very strong first quarter, but then the comparison with last year's \u2013 you know next three quarters and particularly the second half of the year, which showed a top line growth of 16% and 15% is becoming really quite difficult. Can you still grow year-over-year in the second half or are we more likely to have a flattish type of revenue?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I expect that business to grow in the second half, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And looking at paints, if we look at \u2013 considering Ace, considering Lowe's, and B&Q can it be down more than 5% year-over-year in what is becoming the strongest season and therefore the strongest impact on your top line?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes, Rosemarie, it's Jim. As I mentioned earlier, as we look at total volumes for the year in our Paints segment, given the changes that we've seen in some of the North American businesses, it can be very difficult to grow total volumes significantly. With that said, we continue to expect strong volume growth in Europe, based on the initiatives at B&Q, continued volume growth in our business in Asia, as we expand the points of presence within the non-exclusive retail channel and grow the balance of the wall and room business, and as Gary just mentioned, based on the growth we continue to have from a market share standpoint in Australia. So, we're expecting solid gains internationally to be muted by the impacts in North America.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thanks. And if may, regarding China are you doing a lot better than the market? Are you seeing some help from the government changes regarding the housing, pushing housing or at least helping housing or is it all your own, and we have yet to look forward to that particular tailwind?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think, the results we've seen in the quarter are really driven by the expanded point of distribution in the non-exclusive channel. So adding 1,400 new locations is really about building share in that marketplace, less from recent announced changes around the Chinese government supporting the housing sector.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "So, you haven't seen anything, not even any signs of some kind of a tailwind coming your way?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I'm not personally close enough to know, but I see nothing material that has shown up in the first quarter results.", "Rosemarie J. Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks for your questions, Rosemarie.", "Operator", "And we'll move now to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. You mentioned certainly the effects of some of the restructurings you did last year flowing through this year, but curious as to any additional productivity programs you might be able to either enact this year and pull forward and how much of the overall productivity gains are likely to help you make your guidance for this year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we've got our annual productivity assumptions that are built into our guidance as they always are every year. So we're going to continue to see benefits of some of those productivity restructuring initiatives, as we go on through the balance of the year. As we identify opportunities to improve our cost structure and improve customer service, we'll be happy to look at those future restructuring activities, but embedded in our guidance for this year is no material changes from new restructuring initiatives.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Yes, thanks. And then just in terms of Ace, I know that there was a differing levels of contribution between the Ace branded products and bringing in the Valspar brand. Would you help us know where you are right now in terms of the different shares and how much you think additional share gains by Valspar in the Ace retail channel could help your price mix?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, well, maybe to back up a little bit from a historical standpoint, talk about the mix of branded and private label just from a context standpoint. You may recall Nils when we introduced the Valspar relationship with Ace, we initially started providing them just private label products in the first \u2013 really first three quarters of our relationships. So, we were closer to \u2013 we were a 100% private label that point in time, that mix last year shifted dramatically more towards branded as we loaded in the initial product sets for the store. So as we look at this year, our mix is going to be more heavily weighted towards private label than branded, which is always been the plan in the business, and we anticipate that we're going to continue to be able to grow the branded \u2013 the branded sales within the portfolio with the partnership with Ace as we grow that business going forward.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "So did the \u2013 the year-on-year comps in private label versus branded was that a negative effect or positive effect on price mix in the quarter?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Put them together in Q1, we were loading in much more branded product in Q1 last year than we did this year. So it was a negative impact this quarter.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You are welcome. Thanks for your question.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "This will be the last question, please, operator.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. And that will come from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Go ahead, please.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks guys. Yes, so I just had a couple of questions, I guess first off in U.S. architectural, do you think we can get back to kind of a normalized level of gallons that we saw post recession maybe around 750 million gallons or so and what would be Valspar's participation as we climb up from maybe the 700 million or 750 million level where we're now?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you correctly point out, that we've got a ways to go to get back to the levels that were available pre-recession, I think, that certainly achieving those levels from an industry standpoint, that would require a level of new housing starts, that we're probably not going to see in the near future anyway. So I think the broader point certainly from the model that supports the investment thesis that we've laid out for our business is that, the North American housing recovery is going to continue to grow modestly and given that we've got a very widely distributed brand in North America through the various channel that we participate we think continues to provide a very nice tailwind of growth for our businesses. So, continued growth in housing in North America is a positive for the business and we look forward to having the Valspar brand available for a full year within the Ace business, and then certainly with our relationship in the home improvement channel with Lowe's, having Valspar reserve available for a full year as well as consumers continue to generate awareness around those brands.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Great, and just as a quick follow up on the raw material side. Can you just help us understand how long your supply agreements are in those kind of propylene based materials and TiO2, is it less than a quarter or how do you look at that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, sorry, Arun, we're not going to talk about that.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Fair enough. Thanks.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "Okay. That was the last question operator.

McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (NYSE:USA) LLC (Broker)", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Valspar's Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will conduct a question-and-answer session later. As a reminder, this call is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to our host, Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. Bill Seymour. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2015 second quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com.", "Also, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.", "Before I hand over to Gary, let me cover one housekeeping item. We have updated accounting policies relating to the classification of freight costs for shipments to our customers. This reclassification has no impact to our overall results. We provided more details of this in our supporting earnings slide presentation on the IR site.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover highlights of our second quarter performance. Jim will provide additional detail on the quarter's financials and our outlook for the year. I'm pleased with the results for the second quarter, which were right in line with our expectations. We grew EPS 4% in the quarter. We achieved this despite significant headwinds from the impact of currency translation and the expected volume decline in our Paints segment in North America.", "Of note in the quarter was continued strong performance in Coatings, driven by new business wins and benefits from productivity and cost savings. In the Paints segment, our international business has had a good quarter with volume and sales up in local currency.", "Moving on to cover some segment specific highlights, our Coatings segment had a seventh straight quarter of solid growth. This great business continues to show the benefit of our diversified, yet focused portfolio and strong market positions. In Q2, Coatings volume was up, sales were up in local currency, and net new business was up 5%, driven by market share gains. We grew EBIT by 160 basis points, as we leveraged our growth, restructuring and productivity initiatives.", "I'll turn now to our Paints segment where I'll cover a number of important initiatives ongoing across the world. Let me talk about our largest paint business first in North America. As we expected, volumes in North America were down in the quarter, driven by two factors. One, the previously disclosed product line adjustment at Lowe's; and two, the difficult prior year comparisons relating to new product launches at both Lowe's and Ace last year.", "As you all know, we lost a price point at Lowe's as we entered the paint season this year. The good news is that sell-through of the remaining products at Lowe's was up double digits in the quarter. This strong performance is testament to our great brand and to our world-class team working with consumers in Lowe's stores every day. We have a very strong product line up at Lowe's that spans many price points.", "In this spring, we introduced a new lineup of Pro paint. The new Valspar's series of professional paint products includes multiple SKUs, including lines that are now zero VOC. And speaking of zero VOC products, a leading consumer publication recently rated Valspar Reserve the number one zero VOC paint in the U.S. And overall, Valspar had four of the top eight ranked paints. In the independent hardware channel in the U.S. where, just as a reminder, Valspar has sold in over 8,000 stores, we just finished setting a new Cabot stain program at Ace and we jointly kicked off a new marketing and advertising campaign. We continue to make great progress in this channel.", "Our international consumer paint business had another good quarter of performance. Volumes and sales were up in local currency in all regions. China had strong volume growth, driven by continued expansion of our distribution network. In Australia, we continue to see good growth at both Masters and in our stores business. Sales were up high single digits in the quarter in local currency in the stores channel, and it was the seventh quarter in a row that we've grown share with professional painter in Australia.", "More good news in that region. Mitre 10, a leading home improvement retailer in New Zealand, recently selected Valspar as its new strategic paint partner. Valspar Paint will be available in all 81 million Mitre 10 stores this fall.", "In the UK and Ireland, we're now set in all B&Q stores, and we've had great feedback on our paint and the new advertising campaign launched this spring. So, looking at the quarter in aggregate, our overall results were solid and in line with our expectations. Our performance once again demonstrates diversity and strength in our business portfolio. And today, we're pleased to announce that we have further strengthened our portfolio with the pending acquisition of the performance coatings businesses of Quest Specialty Chemicals, which includes coatings for automotive refinish and industrial applications. In 2014, these businesses generated sales of approximately $190 million.", "Quest Automotive Products, the larger of the two businesses, brings advanced technology products for professional refinishers, primarily in North America and Europe. This acquisition will effectively double the size of Valspar's existing auto refinish business. Our customers will benefit from an expanded portfolio of preferred brands, a broader suite of high performance products, increased distribution channels and a stronger service network.", "Quest Industrial Products serves both the professional and consumer market with aerosol spray products and highly specified coatings for industrial applications. This business nicely complements our existing aerosol business with enhanced supply chain, technology and distribution. These businesses are a great addition to our portfolio and we expect the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first full year.", "With that, I'll turn over to Jim to provide more details on results and our outlook.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I will review our second quarter performance, discuss expectations for the balance of fiscal 2015 and provide some additional context on the Quest acquisition we announced this morning.", "Starting first with Q2 performance, reported sales decreased 7% and volumes were down 3%. Excluding FX, sales declined 2%. These results were in line with our expectations that called for a continued volume growth in Coatings to be offset by lower volumes in Paints. The decline in Paints was the result of the Lowe's product lineup change and the difficult comparisons to several large product launches last year during the second quarter.", "Similar to last quarter, the FX translation impact from the strengthening U.S. dollar lowered our reported results. We estimate the currency changes lowered sales by approximately $55 million and adjusted EPS by $0.04 in the second quarter. Excluding the impact of FX, adjusted EPS growth in Q2 was approximately 7%.", "Looking at sales in the Coatings segment, we delivered another strong quarter of growth. Sales increased 5% in local currency and volumes grew 3%, driven by new business wins. Coatings growth in the quarter was led by strong performance in the general industrial and coil product lines. In packaging, sales in local currency increased and volumes were down slightly. The volume decline was the result of lost business comprised of lower margin products. New business wins in non-BPA products increased sales and more than offset the impact of this volume.", "As Gary said, Coatings is having a very good year. For the first half, volume was up 7%. Sales in local currency are up 8% and adjusted EBIT margins are up 140 basis points.", "Moving on to the Paints segment, Q2 sales decreased 12% in local currency and volumes declined 12%. We saw another good quarter of growth from our international paint businesses where volumes increased. This growth was more than offset by a double-digit volume decline in North America. The decline was driven by the product line changes at Lowe's and the difficult comparisons to last year's Ace rollout and the launch of Valspar Reserve. The Paints segment also includes our auto refinish product line, which in the future will reflect the results of the acquired Quest businesses. In Q2, Valspar's existing automotive refinish product line increased volume high single digits and improved sales mid single digits in local currency.", "Moving on to gross margin, we finished the quarter with total gross margin of 36.5%, up 280 basis points year-over-year. The improvement in gross margin was the result of several different factors. The largest driver was improvements tied to our productivity initiatives and restructuring activities. These included benefits from supply chain restructuring programs and manufacturing consolidations in North America and Europe.", "In addition, we had favorable comparisons to last year when we incurred some one-time costs related to supply chain disruptions. Second was from cost price. We saw some modest benefits on select inputs including solvent-based items and input costs in Asia.", "As we move into the second half of the year, we do not anticipate a similar level of improvement to the gross margin rate as we experienced in the second quarter. Costs are showing signs of firming in Asia and other markets. In addition, we will not have the benefit of favorable comparisons to the prior year as discussed above.", "Looking at expenses in Q2, OpEx of 21.9% of sales increased 140 basis points due in part to deleverage from lower sales in the Paints segment. However, operating expense dollars were down slightly, driven by the impact of FX and benefits from our productivity initiatives. Bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT increased 3% and EBIT margins increased 140 basis points to finish at 14.5% in the second quarter.", "In the Coatings segment, adjusted second quarter EBIT of $110 million increased 9%. The increase in EBIT was primarily the result of benefits from productivity initiatives, cost price and increased volume.", "In the Paints segment, adjusted EBIT of $47.3 million was down 17% from the prior year. This decline was driven by the impact of lower sales from the product line adjustments and difficult comparisons to last year that I referenced earlier. While total Paints segment EBIT declined in Q2, Paints EBIT growth outside of North America was up mid single digits.", "Wrapping up the quarter, we paid $24 million in dividends, representing a per share increase of 15% and repurchased 1.1 million shares of our company's stock for a total investment of $93 million.", "With this as context on Q2, let's move on and review the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2015. We continue to expect annual adjusted EPS in the range of $4.45 to $4.65. As noted in the release today, we modestly lowered our annual sales guidance to a decline in the low single digits compared to fiscal 2014. This change reflects an updated estimate of the impact from FX for the fiscal year.", "We look forward to adding the Quest businesses to our portfolio during the third quarter. Let me provide you with some quick comments on the expected financial impact of the acquisition. First, the fiscal 2015 guidance we just discussed does not include the impact of the pending Quest acquisition. But let me give you an idea of what we preliminarily expect. Given the partial year of sales and expected integration investments, the EPS impact from Quest is expected to be slightly accretive in fiscal 2015.", "More importantly, looking forward into fiscal 2016, we preliminarily expect the acquisition to add approximately $35 million in EBITDA. From an EPS perspective, this would result in approximately $0.07 to $0.09 of adjusted EPS in fiscal 2016. This preliminary estimate includes the negative impact of $0.04 to $0.05 in non-cash amortization charges related to purchase accounting.", "In closing, our Q2 results reflect solid performance. With half the fiscal year complete, we've performed in line with our expectations and remained focused on delivering on our full year performance goals.", "With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks very much. Gary, you had mentioned that in the Paints segment, both Asia and Australia had a very good volume trends, but the sales realization wasn't as great. I assume a function of that currency, is part of that also the continued move towards affordable housing in Asia and was there any move down in the price point curve in Australia?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. In China, Bob, it would be \u2013 as we have really strong volume \u2013 less sales and volume because we're \u2013 the non-affordable house \u2013 the affordable housing segment or we also refer to it as non-exclusive distribution is still growing strongly and that's the reason that you're correct when you call that out.", "In Australia, it's all currency. I mean, the Australian dollar has probably been impacted more than any other currency that we translate back. So, yeah, we had really good quarter in Australia. Volume was up high single digits, sales were up mid-single digits, but as it translated back, it looked \u2013 it didn't look that good.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Can I ask you on your initiative at B&Q, I noticed they've got a new Chairman or leader and there's been some change in strategy a little bit under B&Q store based closing some stores. Do you sense that creating any headwinds for you or reducing the growth expectations you had previously?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Not really, Bob. I mean, it's \u2013 I think they announced that their plans were to close about 15% of the stores in their network. I think it's safe to assume that those stores were underperforming to begin with. They believe that they can keep at least a third of the volume from those stores, so if you do that math, it says that the potential business that we had with B&Q is reduced by, say, 10%.", "And if you remember, our number there was 100 \u2013 a little over $100 million, so it's immaterial to \u2013 certainly to the company. It will still be good and profitable business, but I think more importantly as we've said a number of different times, B&Q for us is an important venture because of the optionality it gives us on the rest of the European consumer market which is very, very large, $6 billion or so and very fragmented market. So, it gives us the opportunity in addition to partnering with a great retailer. We're building a team, we're building a supply chain and we believe that we'll be able to expand that business from that base.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Perfect. And just an editorial gratitude to Jim and Bill in terms of getting those slides out, it's much more helpful, I appreciate the greater disclosure there. Thanks.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Eugene Fedotoff at KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Just to follow up on Europe, could you tell us what the volume growth was in the region in the quarter?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Volume growth in Europe was flattish. And it's mainly as a result of our packaging business and I apologize this issue now I'm sure will come up later because we have been showing strong volume growth in our packaging coatings business for the last several quarters and this year, it was slightly negative. And now as a result, as Jim mentioned, of a competitive situation in Europe on a large volume, low margin product, and one of our competitors got a little bit more aggressive on price than we were comfortable with. So we let the business go.", "But packaging in Europe overall had a good quarter, offsetting that volume loss and had sales in the low single digit, approaching mid single digit range. So, in Europe, in general, had a good quarter, sales were up mid single digits in local currency. So, the headlines to that, say, Europe is improving, that's possible certainly our business there remains strong.", "Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks for the color. And then, North America, the changes at Lowe's, was the impact on volume in the quarter? Was it more or less than you guys expected?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Right in line.", "Eugene Fedotoff - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. This is Ram Sivalingam sitting in for David. How are you? A quick question on raws. Can you just parse out what you're seeing in solvents versus resins? I would sort of expect given much weaker propylene and propylene derivative pricing, you guys would look to see a bit of a benefit as we work into the back half of the year, but just curious to hear your thoughts there.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We usually don't talk about \u2013 we had a policy of not talking about individual commodities. And \u2013 but we will say that and Jim said it, I think, in his prepared remarks is that we did see some softness in pricing in the quarter in the commodities that are related to oil and that would be solvents that \u2013 the type of commodities that you expect to see behave cyclically. So we saw that in the quarter. And as Jim also said, toward the end of the quarter and certainly as we look forward through the remainder of the year, we see pricing firming in those commodities, particularly the ones that are related to oil, which on average is at a higher price now than it was during the second quarter for us.", "Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Understood. And then, just on your performance coatings acquisition, is it possible just to give a little bit more color on the mix? How much is comprised of refinish versus industrial?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's about three quarters auto refinish and about a quarter industrial. I mean \u2013 so there are two businesses that we acquired, Ram, one is the auto refinish business and that's the larger of the two, and then the smaller is an industrial aerosol business. Both businesses are highly complementary to our existing businesses and broaden our product offering and distribution channels. The auto refinish piece, which I'm sure most of the folks on this call know (21:58-22:05) extremely attractive from sales and will increase our presence in the North American market more than that percentage. We'll finally be at a significant scale in the North American market.", "The industrial business \u2013 the industrial aerosol business, I think you know we have an aerosol business that's mainly a consumer business today. It's highly complementary from the standpoint of supply chain, manufacturing, and technology. So we're very excited about these businesses and we expect they're going to be great contributors to Valspar earnings going forward.", "Ram Sivalingam - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. In terms of the Quest purchase, you probably can't disclose precisely what you're paying for it, but is it roughly $400 million?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Less than that, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I'm sorry, couldn't hear you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry, Jeff. Bill Seymour is controlling \u2013 Seymour is controlling the electronics here. For some reason, he had you muted. So it's less than $400 million.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Less than $400 million. Okay, that's great.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Jeff, yeah, it's \u2013 I would say the transaction is consistent with industry multiples in terms of our purchase price. After synergy, we're looking at something like paying seven times EBITDA.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And your prices were up a couple of percent in Coatings, can you talk about which areas were up, was that a particular industry area or a particular end market?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't believe that we got any significant pricing in the quarter. Jeff, what you're looking at is a mix improvement.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is a mix improvement. Or where was the mix better?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Packaging with the increased sales of non-BPA coatings.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "And the coil business.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And our coil business, which had a really strong quarter and we leveraged the strong growth into stronger margins. And we also had \u2013 we had a number of different product launches in our coil business over the last couple of quarters that have incremental margins that are higher than the base.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. The coil business also as part of the mix grew in the first half of this year. Remember, we had very difficult weather conditions in the first half of last year, so coil mixed heavier in the portfolio this year.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. So I think early in the call you said something like on an apples-to-apples basis, you are up double-digit at Lowe's, meaning exclusive of the price points that you lost.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're right.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Was that growth faster or slower or the same as the other suppliers to Lowe's. Do they also have a similar increase or do you feel you're doing better or worse than competition?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I don't know the answer to that, Jeff, and I am not sure if I did I \u2013 it would be appropriate to answer that specifically. It was \u2013 we were very pleased with that. As you know, we have several hundred, over 400 Valspar employees that work in the Lowe's stores supporting Lowe's sales efforts. And as I said in my remarks, the strength of our brand and the strength of our product lineup combined with those 400 professionals led to really strong growth in the quarter.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Lastly, when you think about your raw materials, were there particular regions where raw materials were down more and particular regions where raw materials were down less?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Asia was the largest \u2013 we saw the largest reduction in costs in our Asia business, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Um-hum.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Europe and North America were more or less similar.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you so much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Good morning, fellas. First question probably for Jim. On the comments we're \u2013 coming out of Q1, we're going to be flat on overall sales, now down low single digits. But the change in your accounting policy actually increases your year-over-year or your sales from last year. So was some of that dropped down to low single digits down because of that accounting change or can you help me apples-to-apples year-over-year?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, Duffy. Thanks for the question. No, the change in our estimate does not reflect that accounting change, reclassification change because what we've done, Duffy, is we've adjusted both years.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "So we're looking at an apples-to-apples sales number for the full year end for the individual quarters. So really it's just updating our expectations around what we've seen happened with FX since our Q1 call and it's about, call it, $50 million to $60 million sales impact due to worse FX since our last estimate.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Fair enough. And then, on the Lowe's product change, is there still going to be a little bit of a hangover in Q2 next year in that there was still some of that price point that was sold this year that will go away next year?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "I think most of it will be wrapped up by Q1 next year, Duffy. I mean there might be immaterial parts certainly in the first part of Q2, but as we get through the first quarter of next year, we'll have anniversaried most of the product line-up change.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then the last one and you teased a little bit of it out, but I was wondering if you could just ramp the whole segment. Coil coatings looks like it crushed it for you guys up double digits and I'm not sure if it was Gary or somebody mentioned maybe it was a little bit of weather in there. But can you walk through why that was so much better on a volume basis being it's a fairly mature industry?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Well, our teams have done a great job winning new business in that space. That's one driver. The other driver, as I mentioned in, I think, in the Q&A session, is that we talked in the first half of last year about softer results due to the abnormally cold weather and wet weather in Q1 and Q2. So we're lapping some \u2013 a little bit easier compares, but the vast majority of the reason is our team did a nice job winning new business.", "Patrick Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Thanks for your questions.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Thanks, guys. I guess I just wanted to follow up on the Paints segment a little bit. Just trying to understand, you said, you know, you were up double digits existing business at Lowe's and I didn't fully understand that. So do you think it was due to some share gains or is it really strong start to the paint season this year or what do you think is going on there?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think our people in the stores are doing a great job (29:12-29:21) selling, and when a customer comes in, they intercept that consumer and they are helping Lowe's grow their Paints department by selling Valspar.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And so, as you look out over the next year or two, do you expect that that growth to continue and potentially offset some of the share loss you did experience last year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. That's a good question, Arun. Let's just \u2013 let the paint season play out. The first quarter or the second quarter of this year is not the high volume of the year, it's not the high volume quarter...", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Sure.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...as the third quarter is. So let's see \u2013 let's defer that question until our third quarter call and I'll be able to give you more specifics. I'd just be speculating now.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right. And then last question I have was just in Coatings, what are you seeing in heavy equipment and then also in Europe, are you seeing any emergence of green shoots or do you expect that to emerge in the next couple quarters?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as I said, our Europe \u2013 address Europe first. Europe business had a good quarter. And that comes on the back of several \u2013 many actually, good quarters. So we haven't been impacted in Europe to the extent that, say, other businesses have. In the heavy equipment market, I'll just say it's still down. I mean you \u2013 I'm sure you read the announcements from the main branch Caterpillar and Deere. They're not expecting a strong year in heavy equipment. Our heavy equipment segment is doing extremely well, because we've taken significant amount of market share with local players in the China market as well as some others globally.", "The Inver acquisition was a real enabler of our growth strategy. So we've taken share in the off-road market in Europe. And as I said, we've done really well in the China market as well. So we're offsetting the softness at the few large customers where market share growth was.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. It's Dan Jester on for PJ. Can we go back to the strategic rationale for the Quest acquisition? Did you feel like you need to get bigger in the auto refinish business to compete for the multi-shop operators that seem to be consolidating slowly the U.S. auto refinish market?", "And the auto refinish business doesn't seem to have been historically as big of a focus for you in the past, but going forward, is this going to be the fifth leg of your Coatings platform, and should we expect more investment in auto refinish in the future?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Dan, those are great questions. I'll answer the last one last. Yes, we do expect this to be a fifth leg to our Coatings platform. And we didn't need to do the Quest acquisition, but we wanted to do the Quest acquisition. We have, I think you know it was in our Investor deck, the refinish business, that's about $150 million pre-acquisition of Quest, and it's been growing nicely. We've been in the refinish business for 15 years and it's always been a reliable grower, it's always been a very profitable piece of our business and we've always wanted to get larger in refinish. The Quest acquisition gave us that opportunity.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then, just on the New Zealand business that you won that you mentioned briefly in your prepared remarks, 81 stores by the end of this year. What kind of revenue and profit contribution can we expect from that in the future?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's not huge, Dan. New Zealand is a small country, but we called that out because for that team in Australia, New Zealand, $10 million or $15 million of business, which is roughly what we're talking about initially is significant and more significant is that the brand \u2013 our brands are \u2013 will be more widely distributed in the New Zealand market.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "I think as we've also talked about in the past, our business there, we spent last few years restructuring the cost base of the business. So, it's highly sensitive to improvement based on adding incremental volume. So, examples of adding Mitre 10 really helps build the infrastructure of the business and allows us to get to the level of profit that we anticipated from the Australian portfolio.", "Daniel Jester - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks for your question.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks and good morning. Just a question on your other segment showed less of a loss in the quarter sequentially in year-over-year and I think in general just wondering what caused that and if that whatever it is sustainable?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Good morning, Vincent. Thanks for your question. Yeah, a lot of companies I know consider the other part of their portfolio to be primarily corporate expenses and things of that nature. I just remind people on the call that for Valspar that other business segment includes our internal and external resin business. It also includes some of our furniture protection business that we have and it's got some corporate expenses in there as well.", "The biggest change in the improvement in that segment during the quarter was really the performance of our resin business. Our resin business has been increasing volumes, high single digits and doing a nice job of growing their portfolio both in the Q1 and Q2 with a much smaller part of the change was really timing of corporate expenses within the quarters. But again, biggest element is business driven volume increase from our resin business.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And just as a follow-up, I just want to make sure I understand the bridge on the guidance because if I heard you correctly and I might have missed part of it. You reduced your sales forecast on FX, but the EPS range is staying the same, but you're not anticipating really any material \u2013 raw material benefit in the second half. So I am just wondering what are the other moving part \u2013 and Quest isn't in there, what are the other moving parts that keep you in the range or so just what the other moving parts, I guess?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. So let's go back once. You're correct. We commented that the impact of the Quest acquisition, which is expected to be accretive, but not significant for the year will roll in the full impact of that after we close of the deal and when we talk about our Q3 results.", "From an EPS standpoint, excluding the Quest business, what I said was we've lowered our sales guidance slightly simply to reflect our updated view of what we think FX is going to do for the year, so we'll see where that actually lands. The other comment we made in our prepared remarks is that why we expect our gross margin rates to improve in the back half of the year, they will not be at the same rate that we experienced in the second quarter because of the anniversarying of some of the benefits we saw in the back half of last year especially Q4 and the fact that we see some of the prices in the marketplace firming as we look into the back half at this point in time. So we do expect gross margin expansion in the second half, just not at the rate we saw in the second quarter.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning, guys. A couple questions, if I may, mostly follow-ups. On the packaging business, when do you expect to anniversary this loss of the large low volume business that's been sort of holding back the last couple of quarters, is it going to be done by the end of the year or is it going to carry over into 2016?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "It will probably carryover, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It will probably. By the way, you know this business really well and you know what the product line is. This happens. We win some. There are basically two suppliers in this segment and we buy them back and forth a little bit year-in and year-out. So this is not a big deal. And it's not particularly profitable, so \u2013 but \u2013 and it usually lasts about a year before you have another opportunity to bid. So let's call it a year before we anniversary.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Fourth quarter next year \u2013 sorry, second quarter 2016.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got you. Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment in Coatings? I know in Paints that's generally fairly stable and is kind of independent of raw materials, at least some are deflating. But Coatings tends to be a little bit more fragmented and a little bit more competitive business. Has the raw material really been meaningful enough for coating suppliers due to starters containing share gains through lower prices or customer pressures of lower prices? Can you talk about the pricing environment both in the second quarter, but more importantly, your outlook for the rest of the year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think our customers understand our cost structure pretty well, Dmitry, and understand that we've got long-term relationships with most of the customers in our Coatings businesses and they understand that commodity driven fluctuations in raw material costs are not the basis to talk about structural reductions in pricing or structural increases in pricing if it goes the other way. And the impact just hasn't been significant enough, yeah, for us to engage in extremely detailed conversations with most of our customers.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So you would characterize the environment as being fairly benign in the sense of not much changing.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say fairly benign is the way I would say, yeah.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. All right. With respect to the tough comps that you are seeing in terms of getting the Cabot stains into Ace and the Valspar lines into Ace last year and Reserve into Lowe's, when do you expect to anniversary the channel fill? Is it pretty much done in the second quarter, beginning of the third quarter or is it going to impact you for the rest of the year and we have to look towards 2015 to see more robust delivered year-over-year growth?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, Dmitry, it's Jim. You went through a couple of different pieces there. Let me just break them down. So the first is that you commented on Cabot, that's really a \u2013 that's the activity we're doing this year...", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "...in the Ace stores. So it really doesn't have \u2013 but doesn't put pressure on this year's results. Obviously, it's a tailwind. In the North American business, if you recall, in Q1 and especially Q2 of last year, we were just finishing the build-out of the over 3,000 Ace stores with the Valspar brand. We also launched Valspar Reserve at Lowe's, a lot of those sales got loaded in Q2 \u2013 our fiscal Q2 last year so that our retail partners could sell them during the paint season. So we'll see some of the pressure of those headwinds mitigate in Q3 in the business. The pressure that we have from the product lineup change in Lowe's, though, it's going to continue through the balance of the year and into the first quarter.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. That was \u2013 my second question, you preempted a little bit, but...", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "I was reading your mind, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "You are, but I'll rephrase it a little bit. Is the biggest impact of the loss of the Lowe's product points, was it in the second quarter or will be \u2013 the biggest impact will be in the first quarter in terms of year-over-year comps?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "No, it's pretty similar in really Q2 to Q4. It'll be a little heavier during the key paint season in Q3, but not meaningfully.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, thanks for your questions, Dmitry.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.", "John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Quick one on the Quest business. It looks like \u2013 at least at first glance, it looks like the margins are at least a little bit lower than your Coatings division margins. I assume with synergies that that more than gets taken care of, but I guess can you walk us through how to think about the magnitude of the synergies and as they \u2013 how we should think about them rolling in over the next couple of years?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, John, a couple of things. So we'll put this business like we have our existing auto refinish business in the Paints segment. So our EBIT margins are actually a little better in this business and our EBITDA margins will even be greater because the thing that I called out in my comments as well is we're going to have some non-cash amortization that's going to impact EBIT margins. But I think as we look forward into the synergies not unlike the deals the company's historically done like Inver, we're going to have manufacturing synergies, we're going to have commodity synergies, and most importantly, we're going to have sales synergies being able to leverage both of the companies' products against the existing distribution networks in the companies. So looking at a EBITDA margin, call it, roughly 18% today that can continue to grow over time with those synergies and go north of 20%, we think it's a great attractive business to not only deliver higher bottom-line results but also to accelerate the top-line in our refinish business.", "John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Absolutely. Okay. And then thinking about other M&A opportunities, I guess do you see a relatively decent pipeline out there or should we view this as a one-off and this does look like a pretty decent asset for you. So I guess how should we think about opportunities for more of that to come throughout the year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I mean they're just \u2013 they're unpredictable, John, as you know. I mean we have a number of things that are in progress, nothing at $200 million, but a number of smaller ones, at least one or possibly two I would expect to come through in the balance of the year, but maybe not just \u2013 deals come and go and sometimes we pause and revisit, so we'll just have to go. But as you know, it's still a rich landscape in the paints and coatings industry particularly in Asia and in Europe still extremely fragmented. We've been a consolidator. We expect to continue to be a consolidator. And the historical growth that we've achieved through M&A as our target growth for the future which is about half of the company's growth that gets come through M&A, we expect that will be the case in future.", "John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, great. And then maybe just one last question. So now that you're ramped up at B&Q kind of full out, I guess how long \u2013 because you've said this is the first step into potentially targeting a much bigger platform throughout Europe. I guess how long do you go through this trial period to see if it resonates well, if the strategy works before you either move to the next level with your partner, or maybe put it on hold or put an end to it. I guess how should we think about the signpost or what we should be looking for in terms of whether this gets taken to the next level or not?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, minimum. We want to get a full year behind us, certainly with B&Q where our focus right now, John, as Gary mentioned, is on winning with that retailer, winning with consumers of that marketplace and seeing how the business plays out with the full year of advertising, full year of training and support of the stores. That will put us in a good position to read out either a) how we should make some modest adjustments to the model; or b) can give us continued confidence that we can invest behind that with other retailers in the marketplace. But it's good to get a full year's result behind us through a full paint season to understand how the consumers are reacting to the value proposition.", "John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. So thinking about it from a one-year to two-year perspective is probably the right timeframe, is that right?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. I think so. I mean really at the end of this year, we'll probably have a full year of a complete set underneath of our belt, good time to re-evaluate.", "John P. McNulty - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Great. Thanks very much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, John.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Brett, this will be our last question. Thank you.", "Operator", "You're welcome. Thank you. And that will come from Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. A question on wood. Last quarter, it was up double digits in terms of volume. This year, it's down low single digits year-over-year. Could you help us understand what's driving that volatility in volumes between the two different quarters?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. It's primarily coming from the performance in our Asia business. So if I blend the two quarters together, I probably have a more representative run rate. There are some changes that have been taking place in the Asian marketplace around the government providing \u2013 or requiring taxes on certain types of solvent-based products. So we believe we have some customers pre-order some inventory in advance of those regulatory changes. So really if you look at blending of the two quarters together, we probably have a more representative, very strong run rate in that business and the North American business has performed pretty consistent in both those periods.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Got it. Then just on your FX headwind, it seemed a little bit lower, what dropped to the bottom-line was maybe a little bit less than one would expect, was there any transactional benefits there or is there something else that's preventing the FX headwind from really hurting you as much on the bottom-line?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "No, it's really all translation and just given the mix of the business we have in each of those markets. As you would imagine, some of our European businesses aren't at the same margin levels as our established, more profitable North American count \u2013 as our established more profitable North American counterparts. So it really has more to do with the regional mix of EBIT.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Got it. And then just finally, Masters is rolling out some new store formats in Australia, but then they're also looking to reduce at least or they are decelerating the amount of store openings that they are looking for in the next couple of years, but how \u2013 netting all that out, how is that going to look for your volumes in that part of the business going forward?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't expect a material change, Nils. I mean, we've been growing nicely with Masters and they are about 10% of our business in Australia and so a modest change in their plans doesn't impact us very much.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Understood. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "And that does conclude the conference for today.

Thank you for joining The Sherwin-Williams Company Review of Second Quarter 2015 results and expectations for the third quarter and full year review. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells, Senior Vice President, Corporate Communications.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you, Jessie. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're going to begin the call today with some prepared remarks by Chris Connor, our Chairman and CEO, and John Morikis, President and Chief Operating Officer. Following their remarks, we will open the call to your questions and Sean Hennessy, our Chief Financial Officer, and Al Mistysyn, Corporate Controller are with us to participate in the Q&A session.", "But before I pass the microphone to Chris, let me remind you that this conference call will include certain forward-looking statements. As defined under U.S. federal securities laws with respect to sales, earnings and other matters. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.", "You'll find a full declaration regarding forward-looking statements in our earnings release transmitted earlier this morning. In the interest of time, we've also provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website at www.sherwin.com, under Investor Relations July 16 press release.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Chris.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, Bob, and good morning, everybody. Back in January on our year end 2014 conference call, we issued guidance for 2015 that some would say was out of character for Sherwin-Williams. It was aggressive on both revenue and earnings per share growth. The confidence we had in our outlook for high single-digit sales growth came primarily from the continued strength of the North American market, which as you know, accounts for more than 75% of our revenues.", "This optimism was slightly tampered somewhat by declining oil and gas infrastructure investment worldwide and the weakening currencies in Latin America and Europe, because sales volume drives productivity and margin improvement, our bullish sales outlook prompted equally bullish expectation for 25% earnings per share growth at the midpoint of our range.", "Although this guidance might have seemed out of character for us, we believe it was appropriate given the market environment we saw at the time.", "Today, we are revising our expectations for the full year. We now expect consolidated net sales for the year to increase 3% to 5% compared to full year 2014, and diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $10.60 to $11 per share, a 23% increase at the midpoint of the range over last year's $8.78. By any measure, 0.3% earnings improvement and mid single-digit sales growth is a very good year, just not quite as good as we originally expected.", "So what's changed? The most obvious answer is also completely out of character for us. As most of you know, it is our long-standing practice to not give weather reports on earnings calls, but the unprecedented rainfall across most of the United States during the past three months is hard to ignore. 16 states recorded above-average rainfall in the month of April. That number increased to 22 states in May, with 12 of those recording much above average and Texas, Oklahoma and Colorado setting all-time rainfall records.", "And then in June, the rain moved to the Midwest and Northeast, with 24 states recording above-average rainfall, and three of those, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, setting all-time rainfall records. The impact of these extraordinary weather patterns can be seen in national home building data as well. Residential building permits were up 25% year-over-year in May, while actual starts were up only 5%. Year-to-date, residential permits have increased at twice the rate of starts. Non-residential construction projects have suffered similar delays.", "We're breaking with tradition in talking about this weather impact today, not so much to explain our soft sales results for the second quarter, but to illustrate why we remain upbeat on the future. Bad weather doesn't destroy demand for paint. It only postpones it. The change in our full-year guidance is not a reflection of lost confidence, but the reality of lost days.", "We believe market demand remains strong, but we've reached the point where it is unlikely the delays caused by weather will be fully recouped in this calendar year.", "I want to turn the call over to John to review our results for the second quarter and I'll be back to provide a little more color and walk you through our expectations for the third quarter. John?", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Chris, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for second quarter 2015 compared to second quarter 2014, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 2.9% to $3.13 billion driven primarily by solid performance in our paint stores and consumer groups.", "Consolidated group profit dollars increased $120 million year-over-year to $1.5 billion and gross margin increased to 48.8% of sales from 46.3% in the second quarter last year.", "Selling, general, and administrative expense for the quarter increased 3.1% to $999.2 million. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased 10 basis points to 31.9% in the second quarter this year from 31.8% last year, due primarily to the incremental investment to support the HGTV Home rollout at Lowe's.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $12.9 million, a decrease of $3.5 million compared to the second quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $78.5 million to 18.3% or 18.3% to $507.7 million.", "Our effective tax rate in the second quarter this year was 31.1% compared to 32.1% in the second quarter of 2014. Consolidated net income increased $58.5 million, or 20.1%, to $349.9 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 11.2% compared to 9.6% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 25.9% to a record $3.70 per share compared to $2.94 per share in 2014.", "Looking at our results by operating segment, Paint Stores Group sales increased 5.4% to $1.98 billion. Comparable store sales, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months grew 3.9% in the quarter over last year's comparable period.", "Regionally in the second quarter, our Midwestern division led all divisions, followed by southeastern, eastern, and southwestern. Sales and volumes were positive in every division. Paint Stores Group segment profit for the quarter increased $57.5 million, or 15.3% to $433.4 million. Segment profit as a percent of sales increased in the quarter to 21.8% from 20% in the second quarter last year.", "Consumer Group also turned in a solid performance for the quarter. Sales increased to 13.1% to $490 million due primarily to shipments of the HGTV by Sherwin-Williams paint to Lowe's stores. Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $21.7 million to 23.5%, or 23.5% to $114.2 million from $92.5 million in the second quarter last year.", "The profit improvement for the quarter was due primarily to higher sales volumes and improved operating efficiencies that were partially offset by higher SG&A spending related to the HGTV Home launch. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 23.3% from 21.3% last year, an increase in six months to 20.2% from 18.9% last year.", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in US dollars decreased 7.1% to $505.8 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by modest volume increases. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by 7.7% in the quarter.", "Segment profit in US dollars increased to $57.3 million from $54.9 million last year. Our results last year include charges in the quarter totaling $4.5 million related to the exit of our business interests in Venezuela. In second quarter 2015, unfavorable currency translation rate changes reduced segment profit $8.3 million in the quarter.", "As a percent of net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit increased to 11.3% in the quarter compared to 10.1% last year. Our Latin American Coatings Group continued to operate in a very challenging economic environment.", "Second quarter net sales for the group stated in US dollars decreased 17.2% to $150.1 million. Volumes in the quarter were negative and unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales by 17.4%, both of which were mitigated to some degree by selling price increases. Segment profit in the second quarter stated in U.S. dollars decreased to $4 million from $5.7 million in the same period last year.", "Currency translation decreased segment profit $2.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net external sales, segment operating profit was 2.7% in the quarter compared to 3.1% in the second quarter of 2014. That concludes our review of results for the second quarter, so I'll turn the call over to Chris, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full year.", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, John. My comments on the call focus on sales in the quarter because that's clearly where our results deviated from our original expectations. There were some noteworthy bright spots. Residential repaint sales through our Paint Source Group, Pro and DIY combined grew double digits in the quarter. This robust demand was offset by sluggish sales to the new construction segment and protective and marine.", "Our consumer group completed the rollout of the HGTV Home by Sherwin-Williams paint program in all Lowe's stores by May 1 and the program continues to build momentum as awareness grows.", "Sales volumes in most of our nondomestic businesses were positive, but gallon growth was insufficient to offset the currency devaluation which was slightly worse than anticipated in the quarter.", "From a profitability standpoint, the picture is certainly brighter. Earnings per share in the quarter increased 26% and consolidated sales growth of less than 3%. Our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was more than 80%. As a percent of sales, both gross profit and operating profit expanded 250 basis points compared to last year, and profit before-tax improved 210 basis points.", "SG&A actually was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way in the quarter and that was by design to support the rollout of HGTV Home at Lowe's. During the quarter, our paint source group continued to expand its store footprint, opening 20 new stores and closing five redundant Comex locations.", "This brings a year to date net openings to 22. We remain very confident in the long-term market opportunity for this group and likewise, remain on pace to open between 100 to 110 new stores this calendar year, as well as close between 20 and 25 redundant store locations.", "Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4025 compared to 3941 locations one year ago, an increase of 84 stores in the past year. In the first six months of 2015, we generated $349 million in net operating cash, an increase of $17.4 million compared to the first half of 2014, driven by higher six-month net income.", "Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter and first half, increasing by slightly more than $80 million. Most of this increase was to support, again, the HGTV Home program at Lowe's. Working capital as a percent of sales increased 11.8% of sales from 11.7% in the second quarter last year. During the quarter, we acquired a quarter million shares of the company's stock for treasury. This brings our year to date share repurchase total to 2.25 million at an average cost of $284.46 per share for a total investment of $640 million.", "On June 30, we had remaining authorization to acquire just under 3 million shares. Yesterday our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.67 per share, up 22% from the $0.55 per share we paid last year. Our outlook for raw material supply pricing is virtually unchanged from the view we provided on our first quarter call. As a steady decline in petrochemical feed stock prices over the past year combined with improving monomer supply has continued to put downward supply on latex and resin prices over the first half of the year.", "At the same time, high grade chloride titanium dioxide pricing has softened a bit in recent quarters due to continued weakness in global demand and excess supply.", "Based on these developments, we still expect average year-over-year raw material costs for the industry be down in the mid single-digit range in 2015. As I said in my opening comments, we remain optimistic that U.S. demand for architectural paint will strengthen as residential and non-residential builders scramble to make up for first half weather delays.", "This growth, when it comes will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in many nondomestic markets and currency headwinds. Our outlook for the third quarter of 2015 is for consolidated net sales to increase 3% to 5% compared to last year's third quarter for the last year's third quarter.", "With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the third quarter to be in the range of $3.75 to $3.90 per share compared to $3.35 earned per share in the third quarter of 2014. Again for the full year 2015, we expect consolidated net sales to increase 3% to 5% over full-year 2014 and diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $10.60 to $11 per share compared to $8.78 per share earned in 2014. Again, we would like to thank you all for joining us this morning and now we would be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Just given the drop in raw material prices you've seen this year, can you, first off just kind of characterize the current environment as it relates to discounting for paint this year versus maybe in previous years? Any material change there?", "Chris Connor", "I think that pricing has held fairly consistent, Ghansham. We have commented over the past cycles that in this environment we'll see some lower bid pricing on major projects. For the most part though, pricing has been very benign and pretty flat for the year for us.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Okay, and then just -- you called out weather, but was there any meaningful impact in demand from the drop in oil prices and maybe the related impact in the regions that are exposed to oil, such as Texas?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, we commented I think directionally in the comments relative to our protective and marine businesses. We've seen a lot of coatings that we would typically supply into the oilfield, the rig builders, the supply chain organizations that work in those spaces, and we're absolutely feeling that.", "Texas is one area that you mentioned, the upper Midwest to the Dakotas and into Western Canada where we have a sizable business now as a result of the Comex acquisition. We have felt the softness in all three of those geographies.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Okay and maybe a question for Sean in terms of the share buybacks. Just looking back, it seems like the lowest amount of share buybacks in aggregate quarters since 4Q 2008. Anything in particular we should read into that, or is it just sort of timing? Thanks so much.", "Sean Hennessy", "It was really nothing but timing. There was nothing read into it. I think we were asked at the end of the first quarter, it probably had a little more to do with the acquisition pipeline than anything about the stock and -- but again, we still feel that throughout the years we're going to continue to generate cash. We feel at the end of the year our debt to EBITDA will be just slightly above one and we're going to utilize that cash in either acquisitions or buybacks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Bob Koort", "Chris, you mentioned -- I think I heard you right, that residential repaint was up double digits while the new construction markets were kind of pressured. So does that imply while it was raining outside, lots of people were painting inside?", "Chris Connor", "We can only hope, Bob. Yes, we absolutely did say that. I think for going on three years now on these calls, we've commented about the residential repaint being the real strength of the rebounding architectural market in the United States and that remains accurate as well.", "We do see these numbers a little more granular when we break out interior coatings versus exterior coatings, we certainly see the weather impact there. But the strength of that market, despite the weather that we commented in a number of these areas generated a double-digit performance there.", "I think what you should take away from that is the highlight of the softness that we're seeing on the new construction side of it, as we commented on the delays in starts and projects, both commercial and residential, by the way.", "Bob Koort", "And as you guys expand into your relationship at Lowe's, should we expect that that would have, given the DIY focus, more of an interior market there or is that going to be as balanced as you would see typically through your stores?", "John Morikis", "I think it would have more of a DIY slant within the Lowe's customer base. Some of that will be, you know, they will take -- customers there will give those colors to the painters. But most of those people that are going in there typically are do-it-yourselfers.", "Bob Koort", "I'm sorry. I asked it poorly. Is it more interior?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, so the market is [indiscernible] interior/exterior market break out and why we see a little bit more interior for DIY.", "Bob Wells", "The overall market breaks down about 60% of gallon volume is interior, 40% is exterior, in that range. The exterior market tends to be more of a pro market. Obviously, a fewer homeowners are willing to tackle an exterior project than paint their living room. So in that the Lowe's channel tends to skew more DIY, it would probably necessarily skew more interior than the market, certainly more than our stores.", "Bob Koort", "And do you guys have any earlier read at your HGTV how that price point has trended? I know you weren't there a year ago, but versus what had been incumbent a year ago? Are you seeing some pickup at that price point at Lowe's?", "Chris Connor", "I'm not sure I understand the question.", "Bob Koort", "In other words, you displaced somebody else's product from last year. Are you generating year on year gains in that price point for Lowe's?", "Chris Connor", "So we aren't commenting, as we've said specifically, about price points or the Lowe's entirety of the program. All we had said is that this business is going to add somewhere between 2% to 3% revenue. We are two months into the rollout of this and it's ramping up and we're on track with our guidance that we gave you for that business.", "Bob Koort", "Chris, I applaud your consistency.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent Andrews", "Last winter obviously, the winter before this bad winter was obviously a bad winter. So I guess my question is can you kind of get us up to date on through the course of '14, did you feel like you made up the demand that was deferred out of, say the first quarter of '14 through the balance of the year?", "Did we come into '15 with some of that pent-up demand, then we have the winter, now we have the rainfall. I'm just trying to get a sense of, you know, what you think the lag effect is on your underlying sales versus, sort of continued improvement we're seeing in terms of the broader macro housing data, whether existing home sales or housing prices or so forth?", "Chris Connor", "So in 2014's bad winter, as in so many bad winters before, Vincent, we would typically say that, you know, a good week in June can make up for an entire horrible month of February. The problem was we didn't have the good week in June in 2015. We absolutely caught up throughout 2014 and we didn't feel that we came into the beginning of this year with any pent-up demand. Projects were completed.", "In 2015, we're amending those thoughts a little bit and that was the intent that we're just running out of days with having lost so many paintable days in the second quarter. Not even so much painting days, but just construction days.", "We haven't been able to pour concrete to get pads set for houses to come out of it. Big commercial projects, trains and sky lines across the country are delayed and behind because of the impact of weather in these markets.", "Anecdotally, we can comment on Dallas, Texas, where there is north of 30 trains on the skyline. A good 2/3rds of those should be in the painting stage right now. We're just on two or three of them as a result of delays given the significant rain they have had down there. So we are going to have pent-up demand as a result of this particular year.", "We don't expect we'll get caught up and so that should bode well for a little bit of a better start in calendar year 2016.", "Vincent Andrews", "Okay, and just a quick follow-up. Your other income or expense spiked pretty substantially in the quarter. What was in that line item and how should it trend the rest of the year?", "Sean Hennessy", "The environmental. We had a little bit of environmental. We show that broken out on the other, but we had approximately year-to-date, about $10 million. Most of that happening in the second quarter as we took on the [indiscernible].", "Vincent Andrews", "But that won't recur next year or in the future at all?", "Sean Hennessy", "No. We think that we've gotten through most of our environmental expense for the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Had a quick question on droughts, can't imagine it would affect your business directly, but maybe you could walk us through if there is an effect if you see customers prioritize more lawn outdoor or do they kind of switch to indoor painting projects?", "Chris Connor", "Well, Chris, we're rooting for a drought in Texas, Illinois, Ohio, and on and on and on. California and the Southwest where we have been experiencing drought part of the country has been in for such a long, sustained period that year on year comparisons really aren't particularly affected there. So, you know, hot, baking sun creates opportunities for residential exterior paint projects to protect and sustain properties, given the rigors of that environment.", "We haven't seen any significant change that we can point to, to your point that discretionary spending's being moved to landscaping purchases, etcetera. We have heard recently about a trend where people are starting to paint their lawns green because they can't afford to water them, so that might be a new market opportunity for us.", "Chris Bottiglieri", "Just one quick question on experience at Lowe's so far. With you guys entering the market coming back into home improvement channel, have you seen everyone else playing nicely in the sand box? Do you think competitors maybe proactively taking price cuts given commodity basket coming down, or has it been pretty stable?", "Chris Connor", "We've not so much seen any of the pricing cutbacks that you talked about. We often talk about that we're blessed with good competitors. They keep us moving forward and they are not letting us down and we're working hard every day.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan", "I guess I just wanted to delve into the sales growth guidance a little bit. Back in first quarter, you said that you were expecting 6% to 8% for the year. And now you're saying third quarter may be up 3% to 5%. So is it the case that the wet weather I guess has kind of continued into July? I mean, why wouldn't you expect a stronger number for third quarter sales growth?", "John Morikis", "Couple things. You're absolutely right. You look at the weather we've had in July, kind of like June 30, the weather changed. I think that July continues to be pretty variable.", "I think that couple of things, when we take a look at what we think the foreign exchange hit is going to be in the third and fourth quarter versus what we thought was going to be during the third and fourth quarter, you know, it's going to be a larger headwind for us. And then finally, I think there is still some projects that are being delayed from the first half that they still have not been able to get to. So there is a lot of different work that just isn't ready to be painted that's still in the process of getting to the paint stage.", "So there has been a lot of delays and those things, there is only so many days. I think Chris mentioned in his script there's only going to be so many days. So we think that's going to negatively affect our sales gain throughout the remained der of the year.", "Arun Viswanathan", "And then on the industry, so do you expect your sales growth still to be kind of 1.5 to twice the industry, or is the industry slowing at all just because of the weather and that's how you kind of get to your 3% to 5% expectation?", "John Morikis", "Well we'll have to wait and see how the year unfolds and our competitors reports will follow. You know, don't forget that this is a company that that skews heavily to the professional paint contractor and a lot of this the delay tends to be more contractor-driven because of the construction comments we're making.", "So time will tell. I think over the long run, Arun, the point is that the model's intact. We don't think anything structurally has changed here, and, you know we can only delay this, not destroy this demand. So we think we're going to be fine. It's going to be a little choppy getting there.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Okay, and if I may, a quick follow-up on the year's outlook, as you know TiO2 was down in the quarter and looks like it's going to continue to decline in third and fourth quarter. Does that give you any more confidence that, you know, you could potentially be better than the mid single-digit decline in raw costs year on year? Or is it too early to tell? Thanks.", "Bob Wells", "Arun, this is Bob. If TiO2, if trajectory of TiO2 comes in where we think it will, that implies the mid single-digit decline in the basket that we've been guiding to for the last couple quarters. So we don't necessarily see more goodness in the current trajectory of TiO2.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson", "Just a follow-up Chris on your industry view, you showed some slides back in your May investor meeting the issue of 2.8% last year to 720 million. So where do you see the industry this year versus last year? And a related question to that, you talk of a normalized band of 740 million to 760 million gallons frankly looks like we'll be almost at the lower end of that band this year. Yet obviously housing remains well below normalized levels. So what do you think of the kind of true normalized level of demand going forward in terms of industry gallons?", "Don Carson", "So we'll have to wait and see, Don, as we said earlier, but our expectations that that industry growth will be lower than we guided to at the beginning of the year for the reasons that we talked about. We've commented on that band over the years and said that we tend to be on the conservative side of that. We believe that as the market rebounds, it will have to actually run above that normalized band for a period of time because we've been below it for so long.", "So even a million gallons is not an unrealistic number, we see that from a lot of other folks that have opine on what the demand might be in this space. Again, plenty of opportunity for growth here. That's why we continue to remain bullish and open these stores at the pace we're on, one every three days and fully expect that we're going to see that materialize over the coming years.", "Don Carson", "And just a follow-up on gross margins. You had a pretty phenomenal gross margin of 48.8%. It would appear that most of this year's raw material decline is more second half weighted, so maybe, John, you could talk about what kind of momentum you see in gross margins going forward and kind of the carry-through to next year as well.", "Chris Connor", "You know, you're absolutely right. You're looking at 48 that we have in the second quarter. We've been talking about this band of 43 to 47.5, we said we would be at the high end. We're going to actually probably see it just slightly above the high end of the band. You got to remember, we are in LIFO. And so we take projections of what we think are going to come in in the second half and we actually get to adjust our cost of goods sold from FIFO to LIFO.", "So some of that raw material that we're projecting and you're projecting are already reflected in that gross margin. So we see that many times the, we're pretty close to full year gross margin at the year-to-date in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Dennis McGill", "Sean, just on that last point there, are you saying there was a LIFO/FIFO adjustment catchup in the second quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, what I was saying is not a catchup, but we always project out the LIFO. Between the first quarter and second quarter, just because the amount of raws we buy and the amount of paint we sell in the second quarter, the adjustment's usually larger. But, it was pretty flattish when it comes to percentages.", "Dennis McGill", "And then on the comment on, Chris on the double-digits on residential repaint, should we compare that against the same-store gross number of four?", "Chris Connor", "I'm not sure I understand exactly what you're getting at--", "Dennis McGill", "Is it relative to the overall growth in paint stores or the same-store growth, I guess is the question.", "Chris Connor", "That was total. Double-digit was for total growth for paint stores. So that would include the 84 new stores as well.", "Dennis McGill", "It would, okay. So is that essentially saying that new residential was down in the quarter or barely growing?", "Chris Connor", "Certainly lower than the double-digit residential repaint numbers, slightly positive.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And then as you guys approach the second half of the year, given that uncertainty, I guess maybe help us a little bit, as you forecast out those pieces or think about the moving parts, how did you arrive at the second half outlook given the uncertainty that you're seeing in weather today?", "Chris Connor", "I think we took it much more into consideration. We saw that at the end of the first quarter, we didn't think the weather variability would remain as strong as it did and I think, you know, the comments about some of the states in April and May and June, we probably have a little more volatility because of that weather in our forecast.", "John Morikis", "So we would say that by segment, we would expect the residential repaint to continue to be the leading part of that. We think new residential and new commercial is going to lag. And a lot of the commercial maintenance projects should continue to be on track. As we've shared with you, Dennis, you know, it's the residential side of the market that's the largest and, you know, it's new construction areas that we're really feeling the real headwinds.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And then if you ignore any shift in the currency rate, did your change in outlook or did your international outlook change with the guidance provision?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, it did, but the foreign currency also is a factor there.", "Dennis McGill", "If you ignore the foreign currency, Sean, was the organic change, if you think about it that way, also lowered?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.", "P.J. Juvekar", "First question, HGTV paint [ph] at Lowe's, is this taking business away from higher price point paint or are the low end customers also moving up to buy HGTV? Can you explain that dynamic?", "Chris Connor", "That dynamic happening inside Lowe's' box is a conversation that you need to have with Lowe's. We don't comment specifically on their customers moving inside their department to various channels. So again, all we can comment is to tell you that we're fully embedded. The program is ramping up nicely. We're on our original guidance for the program and expect it to continue to be a contributor to Lowe's for many years to come.", "P.J. Juvekar", "And then my second question is on this wet weather. Again, a lot of discussion there, some of the business gets pushed out into second half. Some goes into 2016. Is there a number in your mind, is it, like, 50/50 or maybe 30% you can recoup in 2015 and the rest goes in 2016, can you just give us some quantification?", "Chris Connor", "I don't think we parse the information that finite, P.J. And again, as Sean commented, we have yet to see the weather improve. July continued to have above-normal rainfall across a significant portion of the United States and so it's a little early to make that call.", "We'll see how the year wraps up and obviously give you guidance as we head into next year. But for right now, we're struggling to get some gallons in this year.", "P.J. Juvekar", "And then lastly, on your Latin American Coatings Group were down, you mentioned that volume was up 1%. Can you talk a little bit about outlook in different countries, Mexico, Brazil, etcetera? Thank you.", "Chris Connor", "Overall, I would say if you back out Brazil, Brazil is our largest market for us, for the significant challenges. You look at Brazil in its total and we felt pressure there as well. Collectively, if you look at the balance of the countries, overall we were pretty much flat and we feel as though going forward we're going to be working hard to continue to improve that and grow our position from that point.", "Sean Hennessy", "And P.J., point of clarification, I believe we said volumes in Latin America were negative, not up 1%.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "I was looking at your consumer group revenues. I would have thought that the benefit from Lowe's and along the lines of what you publicly said, you know, might have been 80 million or 90 million in the quarter, which would mean that if you pick that out, the consumer group revenues might have fallen 5% or 6%, something like that. Did something happen in the consumer group revenue base? And in rough terms, is that an accurate analysis of what's going on there?", "Sean Hennessy", "You're close. You're off by, you know, a few basis points. But it's clear that we have a soft quarter in the consumer group when you back out Lowe's. For all the same reasons we've been talking about. Weather has had an impact across that customer segment. I think we've heard softer reports on various important weekend sales activities.", "But in terms of the consumers' profile of their customer base, their share shelf, energy behind their program, nothing has changed in that regard, Jeff.", "I was just going to say, Jeff, you know, you also have to look at the history. If you look at our consumer group last year in the second quarter, it was up 10%. It was up 8% for the first six months. We finished the year at around 5.9. So when you take a look at the comps, this is going to be a very hard comp quarter for the consumer group, with or without Lowe's.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "And then lastly, you probably would want to buy chloride-based TiO2 from China if more chloride-based capacity could come on. Do you find that you're able to do that? There is some new chloride plants in China that I think has begun to ship commercially. Are those plants you can avail yourself of?", "Bob Wells", "You know, Jeff, this is Bob. Whether we do source chloride from China or someone else that has chloride capacity coming out of China, it still has the same effect of tipping the balance to supply and demand in our favor.", "So I'm not sure that we would benefit from sourcing chloride TiO2 directly from China, but clearly, we're benefiting from growing capacity over there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts", "The 3% to 5% growth for the third quarter, I think you said you expect July to be weak already because of weather. But would you expect high single-digit growth in August-September? The weather's normally pretty good for painting then and there's a lot of pent-up demand, it seems.", "Chris Connor", "Yes, I think what we were trying to impress there or point out, that the weather didn't change at the end of the second quarter. I don't think we're making a comment on month-by-month sales.", "John Roberts", "Okay, but are you projecting bad weather in August and September?", "Chris Connor", "No, but we weren't projecting it in May-June either, John. I think as we look across, we tried to give solid guidance as we possibly can here. We're recognizing that a lot of the projects that we expected to be on that would have driven some of those sales gains won't be ready to be painted because of the delayed cause in the construction side of it. So just trying to give you the best crystal ball we can. We think that's a pretty good number going forward for the third quarter.", "John Roberts", "Okay, and you had a competitor this morning that cited a decline in their independent dealer channel. I know the independent dealers have been lagging their professional paint stores.", "But is that gap widening, or did something happen for that part of the market, you know, lag substantially more than it normally does?", "Chris Connor", "Again, that would be a good question for you to ask them. I don't know the answer to that.", "John Roberts", "So you didn't see it -- you have some sales in the independent dealer channel--", "Chris Connor", "A small part of what we do, as you know. Our focus, again, is customers primarily through our own stores.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.", "Nils Wallin", "I believe last quarter there was some details in selling through the, to the home garden TV and Lowe's. I'm curious, is the number we saw this quarter in terms of growth, was that slightly inflated or just how we should think about the growth rate from HGTV going forward for the rest of the year?", "Chris Connor", "I think that we mentioned that because when you look at the load end, May 1st was our target date but to get everything ready for May 1, we were selling some in March. We were just saying there was a differential between March and April. The loading continued through May 1st and we're not going to give quarterly sales for this customer. What we've said is on the annualized basis, we're still going to be in the range that we gave you for the year, 2% to 3% of last year's number.", "Nils Wallin", "Okay. And just, you know, obviously the whole industry saw some, you know, saw declines in volumes this quarter due to weather.", "But just looking at your results, you know, you didn't -- it seems like you didn't outperform the industry as much as maybe you haven't done in the past and a lot of that outperformance seems to be from share gains. Are you seeing any sort of ceiling on your ability to take share or just how are you thinking about share gains going forward?", "Chris Connor", "No, we don't see a ceiling there. In fact, we're very determined to continue to grow, not only perhaps at the pace that we have compared to the market, but even at a faster rate. No, we don't see a ceiling there.", "Sean Hennessy", "As we've talked about this opportunity to put 5000 stores into the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, as we've commented, we're slightly above 4000, accelerating into the store openings for the remainder of the decade.", "So this is a solid plan, being well executed and confident that it will continue to drive share gains for us.", "Nils Wallin", "And just one more, if I may. Obviously, you know, there is deferred projects because of the weather and delays and you probably don't know how it will filter into your results. But is there any risk to some of these projects that have been delayed being canceled?", "Chris Connor", "I don't think there's very high likelihood of that. I mean, data points here on housing permits being pulled, you know, the demand for the projects that we eventually intend to be painting remain strong. They are not destroyed by weather. They are simply delayed.", "So household formation remains strong, inventory of housing stock is as well positioned as it's been in the last four or five years in our country and the need for these multifamily or single-family living units remains fairly robust.", "Our expectations are that these projects that are under way and on the books will eventually get to completion and they will be painted.", "John Morikis", "And the same holds true for non-residential, Nils. There is a lot of structural steel going up right now that's just the projects are delayed getting to the painting stage, but they are not going to cancel a project that's under way.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Most of my questions have been answered. But just following up on what Shawn has said about the face of share repurchases and the fact that you were perhaps not as aggressive in the second quarter looking out to your M&A pipeline, obviously nothing was announced in the second quarter.", "So is there something that we should look over to in the second half of the year? Or did I misinterpret your comments about M&A playing a role in your share repurchase decisions?", "Chris Connor", "Right. I think what we said is we're always trying to get back to that one-to-one in the year and utilize all the cash. What I said is we were heavier in the first quarter due to -- we weren't as optimistic about the, about the M&A that we're going to incur. I think that second quarter, that has no discussion about M&A and second quarter purchases.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. So it was just a question the first quarter was a little faster and the second quarter was more normal, so that's the pace we should expect going forward?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Got it. And then when you look at sort of the mix component of your revenues both in the store group and in the consumer group, it sounded like with more interior sales, that exterior and obviously with the loading at HGTV at Lowe's, is it reasonable to speculate that your mix was down in both channels year-over-year, both in terms of revenue impact, but also in terms of margin?", "Chris Connor", "Well, mix would have been skewed to interior versus exterior in both channels. Is that what you're asking?", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Well, in both channels, but then on top of that, in the Lowe's channel, in the consumer group, you also have the HGTV, which I'm assuming was slightly dilutive to mix as well or not.", "Chris Connor", "It's dilutive mix but it would have skewed to interior versus exterior to the reasons we've articulated.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay, and did that have an impact on margins as well as revenue?", "Chris Connor", "No. No, I think that especially we've commented before, operating margins are all very good with incremental gallons and it's played out the same way this time.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. So exterior and interior paint sales really don't have much of an impact in terms of mix for the company, either on revenue or on margin, is that what you're saying?", "Chris Connor", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Bosshard", "Couple things. In terms of, Sean, the reduction in the second half sales guidance, I know you tend not to want to talk about segments for weather, but whenever we can cover both, in terms of on a segment basis, was the 3 to 4% reduction in sales guidance consistent across the segments or more skewed to any of the specific segments?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, I think that, you know, stores group was the least affected. The other thing you have to realize is the Canadian dollar is really weakened and, you know, Paint Source Group with the acquisition of the assets we received in Canada plus our growth there, they have a little bit of, we have a little bit of FX headwind in the second half there. But, our stores group was the least affected.", "Eric Bosshard", "Following up on that, or similar to that, the stores count for the first quarter I think was around 6.5. Is that -- not to ask what you think the stores comp will be in the second half, but is the stores comp in the second half more likely to look likely to look like the first quarter than the second quarter? Can you just give us a little bit of directional sense on that?", "Chris Connor", "I would say the answer -- I wouldn't go all the way to 6.5. But I do think we expect that the comp stores to be above the second quarter.", "Eric Bosshard", "Okay. And then the last, is there any reason why weather matters more to the business now than the past? There has been periods of bad weather in the past that you have been able to navigate through a little bit more effectively than this.", "Chris Connor", "No, I don't think any more now than it has been in the past. I think when it occurs in the year matters, Eric. We've made it through rough winters where we've had stores close and really been at a loss for customers. But when it happens in the second quarter, which is really the ramping into the paint season and our -- it's really, really strong quarter, that's just the difference that we're feeling this time. And I don't remember in my 30 years having the kind of rainfall impact that we've had literally across the United States that we've dealt with this year.", "John Morikis", "Eric, I would also to that, that when you're kind of in the midst of growing momentum in demand for new construction, which is where we are in the cycle right now, you know, weather does have an impact on, on completing new construction projects.", "Eric Bosshard", "And then lastly, Chris, you characterized your original guidance or you suggested that we might have used the original guidance as aggressive. How would you characterize the guidance you're giving today?", "Chris Connor", "Perfect. Yes, I think 25% earnings growth, I don't recall a year where we've gone out that far.", "But as we've said, the markets look terrific to us. We were capturing the raw material advantages and bringing that down, as we've been showing you we've been able to do that by handling the price ring. It was a huge number for us and we're still hanging in there at 23% earnings growth forecast in the midpoint of the range.", "We're going to get to year end. It just isn't quite as robust as we thought it was going to be six months ago.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg Intelligence. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher Perrella", "I have a question in regards to your Global Finishes Group. With half the sales there coming from overseas, what's your exposure over in Asia? And what product lines, industrial coatings and wood coatings would be most affected by a slowdown over in China?", "Chris Connor", "In China we have our product finishes business, which goes into our OEMs, as well as our automotive team and our protective and marine team.", "So each of those have various segments that they are focusing on for growth and areas that they have strengths in. We'll feel some softness in some of those as a result of the market and we're continuing to grow and focus on new customers and segments. Our market share there is relatively small percentage. So we've got plenty of upside ahead of us there.", "Christopher Perrella", "All right, and then in terms of seasonality in Latin American business, with the broad I guess geography of the region, is that business as seasonal as North America with a large bulk of the volume going out in say 4Q and 1Q, just the opposite in North America or is it more evenly distributed across the four quarters of the year?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, your first assessment was more correct. It would be the latter part of our year would be their painting season.", "Christopher Perrella", "All right. So you could potentially see a pickup in volumes with seasonality there, which will help on the raw material and potentially currency headwinds?", "Chris Connor", "Well, it always picks up in the fourth quarter and first quarter. So I mean, we'll be comparing to those kinds of performance. I don't think it will have any impact on the raw material or the currency. They will be driven by much broad economic issues than whether the paint industry's having a ramping up in demand.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eugene Fedotoff with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Eugene Fedotoff", "Just to follow up on higher administrative expenses, or SG&A expenses in the quarter due to the rollout of HGTV paint at Lowe's, are any of those costs sort of one-time in nature and you don't expect repeat year-over-year for next quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes, I think what we've commented on is the second quarter was going to be the highest SG&A increase due to advertising for the Lowe's. What we said is it was really two buckets of SG&A, incremental SG&A at Lowe's. It was the organization that we put in place and that was going to be flat lined throughout the four quarters.", "Advertising is going to be a little stronger in the second quarter. And you're going to start seeing it at a more normal run rate in the third and fourth quarter.", "Eugene Fedotoff", "And did I hear you correctly that HGTV impact was positive on consumer margin?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Chris Connor", "Yes, that margin in that group is impacted by gallon movement. That's where we manufacture all the paints of the company, so those gallons have been positive and you can see that in that segment's reporting numbers.", "Eugene Fedotoff", "Okay. And the last question on FX, given that you're increasing expectations for the headwinds here, do you expect third quarter FX headwinds to be sort of the same or larger than what you saw in the second quarter? Thanks.", "Sean Hennessy", "We have them slightly higher in an in the second quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Just going back to the weather, you have a lot, I understood probably a lot of projects that are kind of under way and I am guessing that everyone is going to start to aim at finishing at least the outside before the winter and then they will start working on the inside.", "Could your first quarter be helped by that particular factor? Can they do enough to start painting in Q4 and therefore you could have positive surprise?", "Chris Connor", "That could happen.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And so that potential positive surprise is not in your current expectations, is it?", "Chris Connor", "I wouldn't call it so much a surprise. I think your analysis is correct, that we would expect that you're going to get these finished. We're going to move on to these projects. And I think our expectation that that will happen is embedded in the sales guidance we're giving.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And then from -- if I understood probably what you said, the $350 million worth of stock buyback in the first half, is that a similar amount that you are anticipating for the second half?", "Chris Connor", "No. I think that the second half of the year will be much smaller and when you look at the cash generation we're having, again, we're going to be slightly higher than one-to-one. That would tell you we're going to spend less on stock in the second half of the year.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, and if I may ask one last question, which I probably ask every quarter, but given what you are seeing in the industry and in the housing market, are you still comfortable with housing recovery of another three to five years? And because remodeling is actually more important to you, can that last longer than that three to five years?", "Bob Wells", "We do believe that in fact the weather patterns we've seen in the first half of the year is probably going to draw the housing recovery, you know, the path back to normal out even a little more than we anticipated. So certainly three more years to this recovery to reach a peak is certainly foreseeable.", "On the repaint side, not just the homes that are being put in place, the existing homes that are trading hands, but also the overall appreciation in home values that we've seen in the markets should drive remodeling and repaint activity in the out years.", "So we think that this is, that the story is still intact. It's just a little bit postponed as a result of the weather.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Greg Melich", "I've got two follow-up questions. First, on the top line, if we think about the comp store sales growth decelerating about 250 bips second quarter from first, it sounds like pretty much all of that would have been in the non-residential, or non-residential repaint. Is that a fair assumption or was there also a deceleration there just from a high level?", "Chris Connor", "No, that is not completely accurate, Greg. For sure, we saw deceleration in that space. But residential also particularly in the new area is below our expectation.", "Greg Melich", "Okay. So it would be fair to say maybe of the 250 bips deceleration, 50 or 100 was related to residential and the rest would have been commercial and new construction?", "Chris Connor", "We're not parsing those numbers like that, but directionally you're in the ballpark.", "Greg Melich", "Okay, got it. And then the second question was on SG&A. Sean, it was helpful just what you did describing HGTV, but if you were to leave that out, what was core SG&A running on in the quarter and how should we expect that to play out in the second half, especially now that you have a new guidance number for the top line?", "Sean Hennessy", "Correct. I think the new guidance number, we've said all along that we felt that we were going to have efficiencies in our SG&A, but that's when we were at the mid to high single digits.", "I think that's I'm going to stress a little bit. We're very careful not to break out SG&A even by a customer. I think that, you know, for us we're probably not going to break out the HGTV SG&A versus the non-SG&A. I think we're just trying to give you that you can see in the second quarter, the pop, but we're not going to give you a finite number.", "Greg Melich", "Would it be fair to say, though, it's in your new guidance range that you think you could still leverage for SG&A?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Greg Melich", "Okay, great. And if I could sneak in one on the international to Latin America, I think, Sean, you mentioned the guidance change was not just FX, so can you tell us -- so what specifically was that? Was it Latin American volume? Was it Asia? What was the other component?", "Sean Hennessy", "It starts with Brazil, which continues to be a tough story from an economic standpoint. We're seeing the Petrobras scandal with really long legs throughout the entire country. That's actually impacting some of our Asian operations as well because of our position with Petrobras and their production opportunities over there for things markets as well, accelerated by poor economic conditions and bad currency.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question of the day is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.", "David Wang", "I just wanted to ask about the pace of store openings. You mentioned that you wanted to do it perhaps in the back end of the -- in fact I was wondering what's the reason for pushing it back other than a little bit sooner is.", "Chris Connor", "Well, I would tell you this. It's not by design and it's a discussion that we have with our teams on a regular basis. We typically towards the end of the year, as our developers are pushing to get their projects done, have a run at the end of the year and then we're reloading going in throughout the year.", "And we're trying to spread those out a little more evenly throughout the year, but it's not by design. We're pushing these through and getting them in as quickly as we can and we've got a lot of confidence in the models. We're continuing to invest in those stores.", "David Wang", "And then on -- mid single-digit declines in raw material costs, did you see the really high gross margin holding on past 2015, or do you see more perhaps pricing pressure or other things that could bring you back down afterwards?", "Chris Connor", "You know, we always look at the way we run the company as we think these gross margins over time are going to continue to grow. We think our operating margins are going to continue to grow.", "So you're going to have years where Raw Materials are going to hit you or come back or do what they are doing this year. We feel very good about our model and the way we're running the company, that eventually we're going to have our higher gross margin. I would prefer not to comment on the 2016 gross margin yet.", "David Wang", "All right. And then -- I think you guys mentioned that you still see 1.3 million to 1.4 million housing starts long-term. Does this projection bake into the, I guess population of millennials that are coming into the home buying age into the next, say, decade or so?", "Chris Connor", "Yes, David. Actually the 1.3 to 1.4 is what we consider to be kind of a normalized, sustainable rate of build. We think that given the rate of household formation today, the fact that inventories of homes for sale, both new and existing are very low, and that apartment occupancy rates are very high, that this cycle should peak above the 1.3 to 1.4 million level. And then that 1.3 to 1.4 million normalized should trend upward as population grows.", "David Wang", "Any idea how high you guys see it peaking?", "Chris Connor", "You know, the last cycle peaked at 2.3 million. We hope this cycle doesn't get to that level.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears there is no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or concluding comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks again, Jessie. As always, this is Bob, I will be available for the balance of today, tomorrow and throughout next week to answer your follow-up questions. We would like to thank you for joining us today, and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

(Broker)", "Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to The Valspar's Fiscal 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; the instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I'd now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Seymour. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "Good morning, and welcome to our fiscal 2015 third quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today: Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings can be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com.", "Also, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations of the reported to adjusted results and guidance, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Gary.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll cover highlights of our third quarter performance. Jim will provide additional detail on the quarter's financials and our outlook for the rest of the year.", "Before I discuss this quarter's performance, I'd like to remind you that Q3 last year was a terrific quarter. Sales were up 10% which includes strong growth in several product lines, including wood, packaging, paints, and china which had a 30% volume growth quarter, and the highly promoted launch of Valspar's Reserve paint at Lowe's.", "In this year's third quarter, in addition to being up against last year's strong performance, we've been impacted by FX and the change in product lineup at Lowe's. Despite these challenges, we delivered solid performance in the quarter with sequential volume improvement, a 6% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBIT, and a 10% increase in EPS. These results were driven by strong commercial execution and significant productivity initiatives.", "I'll move on now to discuss some segment-specific highlights from the quarter. In Q3, our Coatings segment grew volume 1%, and sales in local currency were flat. We were up against a tough comparison from Q3 last year, as I just discussed. We also saw some uneven market conditions across geographies, including the negative impact of weather in parts of the U.S. Despite these headwinds, we grew our adjusted EBIT by 5% in local currency.", "Looking at the Coatings product lines individually, Packaging volume was flat for the quarter, which was an improvement from the modest Q2 decline. Highlighting the quarter was continued very strong growth in Asia and Latin America and further growth in non-BPA coatings in both North America and Europe. Volume growth in General Industrial was up high-single digits, driven by new business wins in Asia and modest volume improvement in North America and Europe. Our Coil product line is having an excellent year. However, we experienced a lower growth rate in Q3 than we had in the past several quarters, largely as a result of weather that adversely affected construction projects in parts of the U.S. So, on balance, while growth in our Coatings segment was not as strong as in previous quarters, I think performance was good in the context of the tough comparisons to 2014 and some unevenness in our end markets. We are well-positioned for the future as we benefit from our technology leadership, diversified portfolio, strong market positions, and significant share opportunities.", "I'll now turn to our Paints segment. In Q3, as expected, volumes were down. Volume was negative 4% and sales in local currency were negative 3%. Paints segment adjusted EBIT was up 18% in the quarter. As a reminder, our Paints segment includes our Auto Refinish product line. Auto Refinish, excluding the impact of the Quest acquisition, had a good quarter, with volume up mid-single digits. The Quest acquisition almost doubled the size of our Auto Refinish product line. We've closed the acquisition in June and are on track with the integration. Quest sales in the quarter were on plan, and we've received very positive feedback from our customers on the combined offering of brands and products.", "Now, I'll discuss our global consumer paints product line, which is our Paints segment excluding Auto Refinish. Volume and sales in local currency were down high-single digits. We again enjoyed positive volume growth in our international consumer paints businesses, but this was offset by the expected volume decline in North America. So looking specifically at North America consumer paints, as expected, total volumes declined double digits. Strong growth in the hardware channel was offset by the impact of the discontinued price point at Lowe's. Excluding the impact of this price point, the volume and sales in North America were up high-single digits.", "We normally don't discuss detail about specific customers, but I know that our investors desire more information on our performance in the North America home improvement channel. Our performance in the third quarter was modestly above our plan. Excluding the discontinued price point at Lowe's, our sell-through of Valspar products was up mid-single digits in Q3. This was excellent performance, considering we were up against the strong comps of the heavily promoted Valspar Reserve paint from last year. And since we are now through the main part of the painting season, I can say, we expect the revenue impact of the discontinued price point at Lowe's to be at the low-end of our original guidance of $150 million to $180 million for fiscal 2015. I'm proud of our team's performance and laser focus on helping Lowe's grow their paint business. This performance is a strong proof point to the value of our world-class retail execution, great brand, and top-ranked consumer paints.", "Moving on to international sales in the Paint segment, China volume was up, but sales were down driven by a higher mix of value products and a headwind of the 30% volume comparison to last year. In Australia, volumes were flat. In the UK, our volume growth at B&Q continued to be very strong.", "Wrapping it all up, I'm pleased with our performance and our execution especially in light of the challenges we face this year. Based on these solid results, we are updating our EPS guidance to a range of $4.55 to $4.65 for fiscal 2015. Looking forward, I continue to be extremely optimistic about our long-term growth plans. As you know, we have a number of growth initiatives in both Coatings and Paints, and we are very well-positioned to continue to grow our business consistent with the company's long-term trend.", "With that, I'll turn it over to Jim to provide more details on the results and outlook.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Gary, and good morning, everyone. I will cover our third quarter performance highlights and discuss expectations for the rest of fiscal 2015.", "Starting first with Q3 performance, reported sales decreased 7% and volume was flat. While sales declined, we increased adjusted EBIT 6% and EPS was up 10%. The impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar reduced sales in Q3 by 5% and the Quest acquisition increased sales by 2%. Excluding FX, Q3 sales decreased 1% and EPS improved 15%.", "Gary has already covered many of the key highlights from our sales performance in the quarter. I would like to add a couple of data points and provide you with some additional color. First, looking at sales in the Coatings segment, volumes increased 1% and sales were flat in local currency. To help put this performance in context, these results were up against strong comparison to last year when volumes in most of the Coatings product lines were up mid-single digits. As you recall, volume growth in Coatings accelerated in the second half of last year, driven by new business wins in Packaging, General Industrial, and strong performance in Coil.", "In the Paints segment, Q3 sales in local currency decreased 3% and volumes declined 4%. Volume growth at international regions was more than offset by the expected decline in North America. The acquisition of Quest added 3% to Paints segment volume and 6% to segment sales in Q3. As Gary mentioned earlier, excluding the product line adjustment in North America, all regions increased volumes in the quarter.", "Moving on to gross margin, we finished the quarter with total adjusted gross margin of 36.2%, up 200 basis points year-over-year. The improvement in gross margin was driven by many of the same factors we discussed last quarter. We saw continued benefit from productivity initiatives in our supply chain and manufacturing activities. In addition, we saw select benefits from cost price where the Asia region continues to see the biggest improvement.", "Looking at expenses in Q3, adjusted OpEx of 21% of sales increased 40 basis points. Operating expense dollars declined 5% driven by the impact of FX and benefits from cost reduction programs. We also have lower spending in the Paints segment, given the investments made to support the significant product launches in the prior year. Bringing it all together, consolidated EBIT increased 6% and EBIT margins increased 180 basis points to finish at 15.2%.", "In the Coatings segment, adjusted third quarter EBIT of $120 million decreased 2% while EBIT rate was up 90 basis points. The decrease in EBIT dollars was driven by the impact of FX and the decline in sales, partially offset by benefits from productivity initiatives and improved cost price. Excluding the impact of FX, we grew Coatings EBIT by $6 million or up 5% in the quarter.", "In the Paints segment, adjusted EBIT of $51.7 million was up 18% from the prior year. This increase was driven by benefits from productivity initiatives, lower OpEx spending, improved cost price, and the Quest acquisition which more than offset the decline in volume.", "Rounding out our discussion on the segments, the Other and Administrative segment had EBIT of $2 million compared to a loss of $1 million last year. The improvement was driven by increased volumes from our resin and other product lines included in this segment.", "Wrapping up the quarter, our Q3 adjusted tax rate finished at 28.2% which was down 200 basis points versus last year. This improvement was driven by increased utilization of foreign tax credits in the quarter (12:08-12:18) resulting from several tax planning initiatives. Given our year-to-date tax rate, we now expect our annual adjusted tax rate for fiscal 2015 to be closer to 30% versus our previous range of 31% to 32%.", "Let's move on to operating cash flow. Year-to-date cash flow from operations, which excludes restructuring expenses, was approximately $131 million. This amount reflects the decline from the prior year. A majority of this decline is attributed to tiny differences in payments for material purchases versus last year. Excluding the impact of these items which are expected to reverse in the fourth quarter, operating cash flow through Q3 would have been approximately 6% below last year. It's worth noting that the fourth quarter is historically our largest operating cash flow quarter. And finally, we pay $24 million of dividends representing a per-share increase of 15% and repurchased approximately 900,000 shares of our company stock for a total investment of $75 million during the quarter.", "With this as context on Q3, let's discuss the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2015. Based on our year-to-date results and Q4 outlook, we've updated our annual adjusted EPS guidance to $4.55 to $4.65. This compared to our previous range of $4.45 to $4.65. In addition, we now expect total annual sales to decline in the mid-single digits compared to fiscal 2014. This outlook is modestly lower than our previous expectation, reflecting our actual performance in Q3 and sales outlook for the fourth quarter.", "Just a quick reminder that the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the quarter we're now in, does not include the 53rd week like it did last year. This impacts our North American business only. For reference, the 53rd week positively impacted the fourth quarter last year by approximately $40 million in sales and $0.04 of EPS.", "In closing, our Q3 performance was solid in light of the strong growth last year and uneven demand environment this year. We remain focused on executing our plans to successfully close out the fiscal year. Looking forward, we have a number of exciting growth initiatives in both the Coatings and Paints segments that position us well for improved growth and returns for Valspar shareholders.", "With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And our first question will come from Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks for taking my questions. The first one I have is that you talked about your Lowe's business being up mid-single digits, which, based on most commentary, it seems like you're outperforming your Paint department. What do you think is driving that, and does this set you up to maybe possibly take some business back as we go into 2016, or is it too early to tell at this point?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let's not talk about 2016 yet, Ivan. I'll talk though \u2013 this is Gary. I'll talk about the quarter and what we've seen, so far this year. So yeah, we're pleased, as I said in my opening remarks, with our performance there. I think there are a number of factors that are supporting it. Number one is that we've got a great brand and great products. And we've got an outstanding retail execution team that supports the Lowe's paint business. We've got almost 400 people in Lowe's stores everyday helping the Lowe's associates grow their Paint department. And you couple that, those three things with the fact that there are literally many tens of millions of people \u2013 consumers who had purchased Valspar at Lowe's over the years. And when they go back to buy paint at Lowe's and they're looking for Valspar, they still have options.", "We \u2013 Lowe's discontinued the price point as you know, but there's an excellent Valspar price point just below that, called Valspar Ultra 2000, and there's an excellent Valspar price point above where that one used to sit, called Valspar Signature. Those are doing extremely well. And in external paints, Valspar Duramax is doing extremely well. So we've got a portfolio of products to serve those consumers. We've got a great team that's helping the Lowe's associates sell those products. And for those factors, brand, product, consumer loyalty and an outstanding team, those are the reasons that we're doing well.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then, moving over to the Ace business, has that continued to grow and is that contributing more on a year-over-year basis now that it sounds like your expenses are down?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Yes, it has. Yes to both questions, Ivan.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then final question, I'll jump back in the queue. In your Coatings business, first quarter, it's been down in terms of EBIT dollars on a year-over-year basis and I guess in a while. How much of FX was the impact there? And when do you \u2013 what are you seeing in sort of your international markets in terms of, I guess, the topic of the day is Asia and China, and how that's impacting your business? Do you see any sort of slowdown as we move to the quarter, et cetera?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll answer the last part of your question first and then Jim can answer the question's first part which is on FX. So, nothing has fundamentally changed in our Coatings business side. And we've been on a great run, as you know. And I expect that we'll be on a great run in 2016 as well. This was just an unusual quarter. We had some \u2013 as I mentioned in my remarks and I think Jim did, too, we had a little bit of an unevenness in some of our markets. So, for example, our Coil business in the U.S., which has been on a tear, was slowed up by the poor weather that we saw in some parts of the U.S. this year and some construction projects that were delayed. We expect that we'll recover those sales in the next couple of quarters. So, my point is fundamentally nothing's changed.", "In Europe, we actually saw some in the General Industrial and Coil product lines, we saw some incremental improvement over Q2 \u2013 sequential improvement over Q2. Packaging, as you know, the Packaging business is doing well in Europe, but there was a volume issue that we disclosed I think in Q2 where a high-volume, low-profit product was lost in a competitive bid. But excluding that, the packaging business in Europe is performing well.", "And in Asia, in China specifically, our Coatings business in the quarter had a good quarter. Packaging did extremely well. Our General Industrial business which is, as you know, the big parts of that are Container, Pipe, and Off-road did well. We're taking share in Off-road. Despite the challenges in the Off-road market, we're taking share there. The Container business continues to grow.", "So, I read the same headlines as you do, and have the same concerns about future growth in those markets that investors do. But we've got big share opportunities. We're taking share. Every one of our Coatings businesses in the quarter grew on a net new business basis, meaning business won minus business lost. So again, it's just \u2013 it was just an unusual quarter from the context of seven or eight really good ones in a row.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, and Ivan, it's Jim. Good morning. You're absolutely right, it's been a while since our EBIT declined in the Coatings segment, which was one of the reasons we called out both in the prepared remarks that if you look at the impact of FX in Coatings, instead of being down too, from a reported standpoint, FX would have been \u2013 EBIT would have been up closer to 5% or a $6 million increase year-over-year. So, still saw growth in the Coatings segment based on the productivity initiatives we've driven in the business and the performance we've seen somewhere to previous quarters.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yup. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. Gary, can you discuss on raw materials, the cadence you expect to realize in terms of benefits going forward and the latest drop in crude? How do you foresee that flowing through your cost of goods over the next six months to nine months here?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, as you know, David, we buy derivatives in crude, some that are way up the value chain and are way down the value chain, I should say. And the correlation for raw material costs in crude is not so high. It's really supply and demand that drives the pricing of our raw materials. I'll say we, again this quarter, saw some modest benefits from raw material costs. Pretty wide disparities across the regions with, as Jim called out in his remarks, Asia seeing a big benefit because of the perceptions of a weak market and some legitimate weak markets in other categories. So we saw a big benefit in our Asia business, less so in Europe and less so regionally in North America. So, in terms of looking forward, we would expect a relatively benign raw material environment. But again, the movements in crude, the almost weekly movements in crude prices don't really factor into our planning.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Understood. And just on the use of cash going forward, Gary, you've been pretty aggressive buying back stock. Are we going to see a little more debt paydown now post-Quest or how would you think about use of cash going forward?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. David, it's Jim. We really don't think about the use of cash going forward different than we've had historically. We prioritize the utilization of cash to first fund the growth in our organic businesses. Our shareholders enjoy and appreciate the nice dividend the company pays. And then we're certainly always in the marketplace looking for acquisitions that accretively add to our business both strategically and financially. Just similar to history, we just can't time when those acquisitions are going to happen. So in the meantime, we think we've got a great opportunity and have driven shareholder returns by being active in the marketplace over the last several years with share repurchases. So that cash allocation strategy really hasn't changed going forward. It will more depend on the outlook, David, around what do we think the M&A environment looks like over the next several years.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Are there plans to pay down any debt the next 6 months, 12 months or no?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Well, first thing is we paid down a chunk right after quarter-end. So we had a bond of about $150 million that came due at quarter-end. You probably see that in our current liability. So that chunk has been paid. Beyond that, we'll have to see what opportunities present themselves from an M&A standpoint before we make a determination on our debt.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Kevin Hocevar with Northcoast Research. Please go ahead.", "Kevin William Hocevar - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Hey. Good morning, everybody. You have a $0.10 range in EPS expectations here for the year which is still kind of wide given just one quarter to go. So just wondering from your point of view what are the biggest swing factors that get us to the high-end or low-end of that range?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, Kevin, a couple of things. So, as you know, we focus on the annual guidance as a company and not dissimilar to last year as we get three quarters of the way into the business. When we see the results of the performance year-to-date, and we look at the full-year guidance range, obviously there are parts of that guidance range that make less sense in total. So all we're really doing is that we're chopping off the back half \u2013 the back end of the guidance range that just mathematically can't make sense anymore. I would look at the guidance range we have out there as just really being a prudent update to our annual outlook overall. We're not trying to signal many things specifically about the low-end of that number or the high-end of that number. That's just the best update we can provide to be prudent in light of the environment we see on the annual guidance.", "Kevin William Hocevar - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then we're pretty far along in this paint season, so I think this is really the first true season you've had B&Q \u2013 your paint in B&Q. So just wondering if you could update us on your performance so far throughout this paint season.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, Kevin. It's been good. I mean, consumer acceptance of our paint is high. We've activated our full team now. B&Q is fully behind the rollout. We've won a couple of new product lines there just as we move into the fall. So I'd say, all systems go at B&Q.", "Kevin William Hocevar - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Great. All right, thank you very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Bob.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Gary, you had projected a goal in Australia and New Zealand to get up to a 12% margin structure. I'm just curious is \u2013 in light of Masters maybe growing a little bit more slowly or the world is growing a little bit more slowly, is there anything that would cause you to be a little concerned about reaching that target?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Absolutely not.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That was an easy one. Let me ask you more broadly. In your GI business, it's full of lots of things where it seems like investors are running heavy machinery, some pipe and valves, some broader-based industrial stuff, but your business seems to be doing exceptionally well. Can you give us a little more granularity on within the GI, the broad umbrella, what's doing really well and maybe what's not doing as well?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Sure, Bob. I kind of touched on (27:06) I think our container business with Maersk is going well and I expect that particularly with some of the concerns that Chinese regulators and consumers have around environmental issues that further conversions from water-based container coatings to \u2013 from solvent-based to water-based container coatings will occur. So that's doing well. Our off-road business in China is doing well despite the fact that that market is soft, as we've talked about in previous calls. We won a lot of market share with the local players there. So that business is holding its own. Our pipe business is having a great year this year. And as I said earlier, and I can't get as granular on the specifics of Europe because there aren't any particularly large segments in Europe GI that we focus on, they're \u2013 all tend to be smaller, through the Inver acquisition. But the integration of Inver which is now a couple of years until we made the acquisition has gone really well, and that team is growing their general industrial business there.", "So, yeah, I mean it's \u2013 again, we all read the same headlines and we listen to our competitors report, and I think that that maybe cast a little bit of doubt on the overall (28:46). We feel like we're really well-positioned and that we're in a place where we can continue to grow.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then if I might slip the last one in on packaging, if you excluded the lower margin business that you lost or let go, would Europe have been positive or North America positive for the quarter in Packaging?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Europe would have been, yeah, in volumes. Yeah.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Thanks, guys. So, I guess, my first question is just in Coatings. I appreciate the tough comp you saw in China, as well as elsewhere. But the comps continue to get tougher, and in the future quarters, I guess, what's your outlook in volume growth for Coatings, and maybe if you can break that down by product line?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. We're not going to go through a forward view of each of the individual businesses, but maybe set a couple of pieces on context, Arun. One is, if you look at the performance of the Coatings segment really, over the last two years, quarter on top of quarter, if I look at the two-year comps, we've been growing the business from a volume perspective in the mid single to high single-digit range on a two-year basis.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "So, we continue to see the success that we had last year especially as we move in to Q4. We're going to have a couple of other, I'd say, unique comparisons as well. I reminded people in my comments about the 53rd week that we'll experience in the North American business, and also we talked pretty extensively last year around the non-BPA conversion in Europe. A lot of those sales started to take place really at the end of Q3 and certainly into Q4. So we had a very strong packaging volume growth (30:39-30:55) last year.", "So we have to anniversary those things in the mix, but going forward to the point Gary made, we're still focused on growing our market share in each of our Coatings businesses. We got a long way to go and continuing to grow our Packaging business in Europe which is a bigger market than North America. We're continuing to make great progress in growing Packaging in China, which is a key growth strategy of that business. And our Coil business and Wood business continue to have growth opportunities given their share in the markets to drive growth.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "But just to clarify, if we're all seeing the same headlines and global growth is slowing, is it technology or service or are there specific reasons why you think you can continue to kind of hit that mid single to high single level of volume growth?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. I think there's all of those. So if you look at the technology differences that we've been talking about in our packaging business around non-BPA, that environment is still going to be in place. If you look at the Europe \u2013 I'm sorry, if you look at the Asian business from a packaging standpoint, can consumption continues to grow in that marketplace as the economy moves for more utilization of bottles into cans. So yes, there may be differences in demand next year, but that trend of moving the bottles to cans isn't going to change from a structural standpoint. And I would say the story within each of our individual Coatings businesses also has similar elements depending upon the geography that we're in. So we'll have to wait and see, and to see how the year pans out, next year. Currently, there's certainly some volatility in the marketplace. But even despite that volatility issue, we're posting strong growth in some of those end markets that are struggling a little bit.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Great. And then on the other segment, this is the second quarter in a row that we're seeing some strong growth from your in-house resin production. With the drop in oil, do you expect that to continue? Is there a right level of guidance you can help us with for that segment? I know it's small, but just to put it into context.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Just a couple of things, our resin business has been performing well. They've been growing volume, right? So they've seen some of the productivity improvements from a supply chain and manufacturing perspective that our other businesses have. But that business has been doing a nice job of growing volumes, which has helped contribute to the performance. From an individual segment standpoint, as you know, we don't provide guidance, individual segments. What I would say is, with the benefits that we've seen there this year are largely driven by the business improvements in resins. And we have a small furniture protection business that's included in that segment as well that has been growing a little bit. So, you're right in the context of our total Paints and total Coatings businesses, they're relatively \u2013 that's relatively small, but we've seen nice performance from those businesses.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And just lastly if I may on Paints. There's been some discussion about further market share shifts also in non-paint categories. Are you seeing anything in stains or any other areas that we should be aware of? Do you have still a positive outlook there and maybe if there's any detail on that?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You have to be \u2013 tell me specifically what you're talking about, Arun.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Well, I mean, I guess I've heard of some shifting around in stains at various retailers. I don't know if that's impacted you at all, but I guess I was curious if it has.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Only in a positive way.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, what we've \u2013 we've rolled out distribution of Cabot stains through the Ace Hardware organization. I think we're placed in 1,500 stores, roughly 1,500 Ace Stores today. We've got a 500-store test of Cabot running at the Home Depot at the moment and that...", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...appears to be doing well. So, if there are changes in the stain category, I would say that they'd be positives for Valspar.", "Arun S. Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes. Good morning.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Good morning, P.J.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "So \u2013 yeah. Gary, with lower raw material prices, you've seen lower propylene, TiO2, et cetera. Have you seen any pricing pressure or a discounting at the big boxes or hardware stores? And the same question on the Coatings side, are any of your customers asking for givebacks?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, P.J., as I \u2013 as we've taken pains to say, although the reductions in some of those raw materials don't necessarily flow right through to the cost of product. There have been some \u2013 as I said, there are some modest improvements that we saw on the cost structure, particularly in Asia where we have done some things with our customers that would support their business. And then, there are some isolated instances where there have been raw materials, specific raw material movements that have led us to make some pricing adjustments with other customers. But it certainly hasn't been across the board. It's been targeted. It's been specific to unique situations where we've \u2013 where there's been an actual reduction on raw material costs and that's the way we run our business and supply chains.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And just quickly, is that more on the Coatings side or is that isolated incidences on the Paints side?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's been more on the coatings side.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "And then, secondly, you talked about you have at Lowe's, you have paint price points just below the new competitor product and just about the new competitor product. So if you look at where this new product, HGTV paint, taking share, is it taking share from the higher end price point or lower end price point? Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I tried to explain that both the price point, our high price point paints and our low price points paints, are doing exceptionally well, better \u2013 much better than last year at those price points.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. So...", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So you can't \u2013 that's not taking share. That's growth. That's the way I was trying to explain it, P.J. If I didn't explain that well, sorry. But no, those price \u2013 both those price points above and below the competitive entries are doing extremely well.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. So the only business you lost was that price point and it has an impact than anything else.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Correct.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you and good morning. If I heard your \u2013 Gary, your prepared comments correctly, I think you indicated that you'd step back a bit on the media spending after introducing it at a much higher level last year. Is that level that you're at now? Should we think about that as sort of the run rate, or do you think there's more opportunity to be more efficient with it going forward?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think what you're referring to, Vincent, is the \u2013 when I mentioned the highly promoted Valspar Reserve last year. Yeah, I mean, I think whenever there's a new product launch, there's more advertising than there would be on a run rate basis. So if you're asking me is the advertising that we're putting behind that particular product lower this year than last year, the answer is yes.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Yeah. And I was just asking whether this was sort of, as you mentioned, when you introduce something, it's high, but now, it's a known product. So is this the correct run rate then?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yeah, I think about this \u2013 I don't know \u2013 if you're thinking about it in terms of a quarter, I'm thinking about it...", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I'm thinking about it sort of \u2013 as just sort of the go-forward. Should we see it progressively come down sequentially going forward or \u2013 and then step back up in the same quarter next year, or what's the...", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We're going to \u2013 I think about next year, next paint season, what news we have, what new products we'll be introducing at which retailers, and that will determine the level of advertising spend that we do next year. There's a ROI calculation that we do. We work with our retail partners to determine how much promotional dollars that they're willing to put behind the products. We'll make a commitment of dollars to support product launches and our brand, and that will be a negotiated number.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "But it will always have a positive ROI for us and our retail partner.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Understood. And then just a quick one on the weather impact you mentioned in Coil which you saw, and that you expect to get it back. But the \u2013 on the architectural side of things, obviously we've heard from all of your competitors that there was an issue in the calendar second quarter. You obviously have a glimpse into the calendar third quarter, both in the quarter you reported and where you are today. Are you seeing some sort of exterior paint work that was \u2013 the days were lost in the North American market, or do you think that's going to catch up a bit over the balance of the year or hard to tell?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. As we look at our DIY paint business and our Pro paint business, we certainly did not see the same trends in our exterior products as we saw in our interior products, speaking to the general softness that people have come under (40:39) from a weather standpoint. So we think we're going to get a portion of that back at the end of the day. But it's really difficult for us to slice specifically how much that impacted us in the quarter, which is why we didn't call that component out specifically.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks for your questions, Vincent.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC", "Hi. This is Matt Skowronski filling in for Dmitry. Now that your B&Q business is kind of fully established, can you comment on how things are going and whether or not you think the business is meeting your initial expectation?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I commented on it earlier, Matt. It's Gary. It's going well. And I would say that it's meeting our (41:27), but it was delayed. If you'll recall, the rollout was delayed by six months or eight months due to the complexity of resetting the stores. So if you look at the pure financial model that we had, say, 18 months ago, we're a little bit behind. But in terms of how we performed since we've set the stores, we're right on our plan.", "Matthew Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. All right. And on the margin side, what would you say is kind of driving margins now in the future? Obviously, your efficiency initiative has been working (41:59) quite well as we saw with margins this time. Would you say that this is going to continue for the rest of the year or well into 2016?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Well, what we've called out in previous calls that \u2013 and we expect margin improvement to continue in this year. I've commented specifically from a total Valspar perspective that the rate of margin growth was going to be less in Q3 and Q4 than we experienced in the second quarter and that's exactly how things have played out. So we're going to start to anniversary some of the benefits from a productivity standpoint that we started last year, mainly on the manufacturing side of the business with some of the plant closures we did related to Inver and how we also have set the operating environment in support of the Ace business. So we're going to be up a little against a little tougher comparison margin in Q4, if you go back and look at last year's Q4 margin which I believe was up close to 180 basis points. So we're going to see a little step-down. But we're still going to have growth over the previous year in the fourth quarter.", "Matthew Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC", "Perfect. Thank you so much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yes. Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you guys doing?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good, Matt. Thanks.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good. You touched on this briefly before, but how did Pack \u2013 how did the flat Packaging volumes during this third quarter compare to overall market performance? And can you guys provide some additional detail on relative performance and competition both in Europe and the U.S.?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Here's the way I think about it, Matt. We performed at the market in North America. We performed well above the market in Asia, and excluding the one piece of business that we've talked about for the last couple of quarters that we lost low margin, high volume, we would go on at or above the market.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, given some of the more positive trends we've seen in the Marine Coatings business, can you guys talk a little bit more about how Marine Coatings volumes have progressed during 2015 and then what your expectations are moving forward?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, Matt. As we look at our business, I would say we really don't have a Marine Coatings business. You may be referring to our Container business that is certainly products that are used and shipped via marine. So, our Container business within General Industrial has been very strong, really given the technology that we put forth in the marketplace in China around water coatings. But I would say comparing our results from a marine standpoint to others is probably a little bit of an apple-and-oranges comparison.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. That's helpful as well. That's it for me.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thank you, Matt. And, operator, I think there's one last question in the queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. And that will come from Mike Ritzenthaler with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi. Yes. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups, I guess, from me. On Quest, if I did my math correctly, it looks as though the contribution from Quest is annualizing quite a bit less than that where the revenue run rate was for 2014. I guess, can you help us understand some of the seasonality in 3Q if there was any or what's maybe some of the puts and takes on the revenues from Quest in the quarter maybe, what we can expect for Q4?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I'll take the first part now and let Jim answer your specific question, Mike. Quest, as I've said, Quest is performing on our sales plan. So, there is no \u2013 there has been no degradation from 2014. I'm not sure where you got that number since it wasn't a public company and part of the company in 2014. But we're right on our plan, both in terms of revenue growth, integration, cost synergies, and getting the management teams aligned on the new program. So, I'm not sure where you got your data point, but I'm going to let Jim explore that a little further with you.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, and there is some seasonality through it. The way I will just helicopter up and say that it's roughly a $200 million business from an annual standpoint. There is lower seasonality for the business in Q4 than there is in Q3, but to Gary's point, we're not thinking about that business any differently than we have in the past and we're certainly not seeing a decline versus the previous year.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And Mike, something that might be helpful here is remember that when we acquired Quest, it was about $200 million in revenue. $50 million of that went, I guess, reported in \u2013 or I guess, sorry...", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "It's all in Paints.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's all in Paints, but actually, it's \u2013 they end up in different places in the company.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah.", "Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. All right that's helpful. And I guess, just one other \u2013 some notes that I'm curious about is on your supply chain efficiencies and I guess to the extent that that includes optimizing manufacturing to support the B&Q rollout now that that's established, I guess how much more can be done just sort of optimize the supply into that channel from the total manufacturing or adjacent manufacturing in Europe versus manufacturing in different geographies and should have been there?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "There might be some incremental improvements that we could make. Our supply chain, the cost structure of our supply chain to support B&Q is in good shape, Mike.", "Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "All right. Fair enough. Thanks very much.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "I think that was the last question, operator.", "Operator", "It certainly was.

With that, let me turn the call over to John to review our performance for the third quarter.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone.", "Our results in the third quarter 2015 clearly demonstrate the earnings power of this business model. Although we faced some difficult headwinds to revenue growth mostly related to currency devaluation, further softening in demand for industrial coatings, and a slow recovery in domestic construction activity, diluted net income per common share increased 18.5% to $3.97, an all-time high for any quarter in our history.", "Sales volumes lagged in many of our operating segments, but our domestic architectural paint volumes remain strong and drove operating rates higher in our US manufacturing and distribution facilities. This resulted in significant operating leverage in the quarter. This operating leverage, combined with stable pricing, favorable raw material costs in most of our domestic businesses, and good SG&A expense control across the Company drove consolidated gross margin, TVT margin, and net income as a percent of sales falls to record levels.", "I will spend a few minutes highlighting overall Company performance for third quarter 2015 compared to third quarter 2014, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased of 0.1% to $3.15 billion. Solid domestic demand for architectural paint was mostly offset by weak volume demand in our non-domestic business and currency devaluation. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $103 million year over year to $1.57 billion and gross margin increased 320 basis points to 49.9% of sales from 46.7% in the third quarter of last year.", "Selling, General, and Administrative expenses for the quarter increased $9.3 million to $993.6 million. As a percent of sales, third-quarter SG&A was 31.5%, up 30 basis points from last year.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $17 million, an increase of $970,000 over third quarter last year. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $76.7 million or 16.2% to $551 million.

Chris?", "Chris Connor", "Thanks, John, and good morning, everybody. Thanks for joining us today.", "I think John's opening comments pretty much said it all. Revenue growth was weaker than expected in the quarter, but the earnings power of our Company has never been stronger.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ghansham Panjabi of Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Hey guys. Good morning.", "John Morikis", "Hey Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Maybe John with the new high watermark for margins.", "John Morikis", "He's up to the task, don't worry Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "John, good luck with that. First off on the Paint Stores Group and your 2.1% reported same-store sales, can you sort of parse out for us the performance between architectural and some of the other protective coatings in that market that you saw in that channel?", "Chris Connor", "The architectural side was by far the strongest. We had a very good and strong performance in architectural and our industrial protective and marine side we clearly faced some headwinds there. We do very well, particularly in the petrochem area, we out index probably the market by quite a bit and with the softness there that has a netiquette impact on our volume.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "So architectural two to three times?", "Chris Connor", "Yes.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "And I guess on that note should we expect same-store sales to continue to be pressured by these categories in 2016 or do you think there will be a tailwind from the [indiscernible].", "Sean Hennessy", "This is Sean Hennessy. When you look at 2016, I think we're putting that together right now and I think in January when we discuss the fourth quarter we'll also be giving you some guidance on 2016 and give you a clearer picture.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Okay. Thanks so much, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan of RBC. Please go ahead.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious on the raw materials side. We did have some declines here as well in the third quarter. Are you still kind of sticking to the mid single-digit decline in 2015 and what's your outlook for 2016?", "Bob Wells", "Yes. This is Bob. We are still sticking to our mid single-digit decline for year-over-year average raw material basket for the industry. We think in the back half it is likely trending to the high end of a mid single-digit range just based on the trajectory of raw materials over the course of the year, but we're standing by ever mid-single digit outlook. For 2016?", "Arun Viswanathan", "Right.", "Bob Wells", "I'm sorry, Arun. Maybe I misunderstood the question. We are really not in a position to give a raw material outlook for 2016 yet. We will do that on our year-end call.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Okay. Appreciate that. As a follow up, on the volume side, 2% comp in the quarter. I was just curious how that played out versus your own expectations. I think last time we were expecting a slight increase in Q3 versus Q2 which did a 3.9 and then I guess similarly maybe you could just talk about if there's been any structural changes to the market which would prevent you from going back to the kind of mid single-digit level for next year? Thanks.", "Bob Wells", "I would tell you when you look at our sales guidance for the third quarter to where we came in, I think that we were a little disappointed in the comps store and stores group. We were not disappointed at all in the architectural performance. We felt that we continually said over the long run we think we can beat the market by one and a half to two times. We think we are right there.", "On the protective marine side there was a little bit of a challenge, maybe a little more of a challenge than we thought and that hurts us two ways. That hurts us in the volume and secondly the average selling price. So, that has a little more effect on the cause of that Q1 to be lower. Structurally, those type of things on the architectural side we still are as confident as ever.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.", "Aram Rubinson", "Thank you. Two questions. First of all on the paint stores. You did indicate that the volumes were higher than the comp. Can you just give us a sense on the price mix element? I think last quarter it was a negative 1.5%. What are we looking at in the third quarter for price mix and maybe break it down?", "And then also I know you were going after the R&R contractors a little bit more. That might have hurt your mix in Q2. What did we do with that in the third quarter?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think the biggest impact of the price mix, Aram, has been the comments that you are hearing this morning about the struggles continuing into protective and marine. As a reminder, these are gallons that can sell upwards of $100 a gallon for us. As we commented, the pricing disciplines of the Company are in great shape.", "You see that in the margins. Our residential repaint numbers are up double digits as we commented, so the price mix issues are really holding up fine on the price side, it's just the types of end market gallons are having a little impact here.", "Aram Rubinson", "Then could you help us. I think you guys are doing some things on the store front that you may not have talked about which is kind of leaning down the stores, doing more centralized deliveries, working capital being a bit more centralized. Are there things you are doing on the store side that are worth airing in that regard?", "Chris Connor", "No. Nothing worth talking about truthfully. Our focus is on making sure that our people and our products are where our customers need them. So anything that we're doing in the field is to better align our resources with our customer's needs.", "John Morikis", "And there is really no programs that we're undertaking, Aram, in that space at all. That is just not beyond our normal efficiency practices.", "Aram Rubinson", "And then just if you can give us the gross profit dollar increase by segment and then I'll leave you guys for the next questioner.", "Sean Hennessy", "Okay. Give me one second. Gross margin dollar changed in the third quarter by segment same-stores group increased $89.2 million. Consumer was increased by $34.2 million. Global Finishes Group was down $5.6 million, and the Latin America Coatings Group was down $[17.8] million.", "Aram Rubinson", "Got it. Thank you. It looks like your Paint Store Group gross margin was about the same as the house from our map. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer of Barclays.", "Duffy Fischer", "Question on how you achieve your awesome margins in Paint Stores. Obviously if volumes were not as strong as you had anticipated -- incremental margins are very strong, so every gallon you don't sell should hurt.", "The mix seems to hurt in protective and marine as a higher ASP so I'm assuming more profitable, but yet you just crushed the margins. Can you talk through how you were able to do that?", "John Morikis", "A couple things. Again, just back to the point that Chris just reiterated, I think architectural gallons we're really good, I think that any time we get those architectural gallons going in the right way. I think that number two we had really good SG&A control in Storage Group. So when you see our total SG&A up $9 million, I know it's 3/10 of a percent of sales so, that's going pretty well.", "And the Comex. We had the Comex integration in the third quarter. We are now fully through it. We think the third quarter was you see the full effect of the Comex. You see it in two places.", "When you talk about this Comex you see it in Stores Group as well as you see it in Consumer Group. And you look at the operative margins that consumer was able to generate, so that Comex acquisition is doing very well now, integrated very well by our teams in the field, and you're seeing those types of things in both of the segments.", "Duffy Fischer", "Okay. And then maybe just a to shift a quick to the HGTV. We've gone through one paint season trending towards the bottom end of the range you thought about. What's the after action review on that? What went well? What didn't? Is it just going to take a little bit longer, brand recognition and stuff like that, and what should we expect different next year?", "John Morikis", "Duffy, as we look at this going forward we're quite excited. We have got a good partner with a good relationship there. We've learned, there is no question about it, and we're comfortable with the direction we're going here.", "We continue to work hard with the store associates as well as Lowe's corporate. We've expanded our SKUs just recently launching into a satin finish which is a very important finish in the home center channel, so we're expanding our SKU count, we are getting more in tune with our customer, and quite frankly we're looking forward to a strong future with this program.", "Duffy Fischer", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Duffy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dennis McGill of Zelman & Associates.", "Dennis McGill", "Thank you. I guess this question is on the overall gross margin. Setting a record high and I think you've obviously said that a lot of times over the years, but is there a point where you worry at all about competitive actions or worry more than normal about competitive actions or threshold where you feel like you have achieved everything on the margin side?", "John Morikis", "Dennis, we worry about that every day, so thanks for calling that out to our attention. Obviously the market dictates the prices we can get for our products. We compete in a very respected industry. The quality of our products and the services can command a price in the market I think you're seeing the leverage of the business model come to fruition here.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. And on the protective and marine, can you maybe just split out a portion of revenue within that segment that would be tied to that piece of the business?", "John Morikis", "Tied specifically to the petrochemical part of it?", "Dennis McGill", "Not just petro but the protective and marine as a total within Paint Store?", "John Morikis", "Inside the store's business?", "Dennis McGill", "Yes.", "John Morikis", "That would be low to mid teens, Dennis, 13% to 15% of the Paint Stores Group revenue.", "Dennis McGill", "Okay. Great. Thank you and, Chris, thank you for the honesty and humor over the years. We'll miss you. Appreciate it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas of JPMorgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning. It's [indiscernible] in for Jeff. How are you? You said that your core consumer gross was flat in the quarter, so that means that HGTV contributed maybe $40 million to sales? Is that about right?", "Bob Wells", "That's in the range.", "Unidentified Analyst", "That's an range. Okay. And another gross margin question. So, prices went low again this third quarter and as best as we can tell nobody has realized those benefits yet. Very few raw material inventories probably in the fourth quarter. Do you expect to have more raw materials benefits in the first half next year?", "Bob Wells", "We obviously give a detailed raw material outlook on our year-end call in January. We have commented that based on the current trajectory of the petrochemical side of the raw material basket, raw materials should be a tailwind next year. We will give you a little more color around that at year end.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And lastly, do you have in outlook for your corporate expense in the fourth quarter? There was a pretty large environmental component in the fourth quarter last year and probably reappear?", "John Morikis", "Exactly. When you look at it, we do not have the environmental repeating. I think when you see the EPS guidance we have given you versus last year, you can see that -- and that environmental went into the admin segment so, yes, just because of that you're going to see an improvement in that admin segment.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar of Citi.", "Dan Jester", "Good morning. It's Dan Jester on for PJ. I think I heard you correctly that you said that the DIY business at the stores was down in the quarter. I was just wondering are you seeing any evidence that maybe the program at Lowe's is taking DIY customer away from your store?", "Bob Wells", "No. We don't think that is the impact in the quarter at all. That HGTV program was a de minimus part of our store's business. We've always felt that the customer that chooses to shop in a specialty paint store is a fundamentally different customer than a big box customer.", "And in the quarter, softness was really driven over some timing and promotional activity earlier in the quarter and it's actually been rebounding nicely. We had a good September in DIY stores to our stores business.", "Dan Jester", "Okay, and then kind of sticking with that theme. I believe you talked previously about kind of re-energizing your investment plans and some of your other brands and consumers like Dutch Boy and Pratt & Lambert. Should we be thinking about any major programs using any of those brands in the future?", "John Morikis", "We are obviously looking at every brand and evaluating the investments that we go in there. We're going through our planning process right now with our teams. You would expect that our diversified brands team is in fact looking at some of those brands to get behind and we will be talking about those as we roll into next year.", "Dan Jester", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Koort of Goldman Sachs.", "Chris Evans", "Good morning. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. The challenging environment outside of North America, if you could talk about how you plan to sort of manage those declines you're seeing in Latin America in your global finishes brand?", "John Morikis", "I think that as a company we've always taken a look first and foremost when you're looking in Latin America if you look at the history of us, making sure that we remain cash positive and just like Argentina in 2002 and some of things that happened in the 90s with hyperinflation, we continue to make sure and we stay cash positive which makes it easy to continue to invest in those kinds of countries.", "Secondly, whether it's even in United States stores group, in Houston in the 80s or other places, if there's something -- we try to take advantage of these types of markets and we're looking at assets and we're looking at investments down there that eventually will come back.", "We think Latin America is having a tough time currency-wise, but the things will be able to do in Mexico this year and we're still investing in the rest of the Latin America group for us. We feel very good about the long term of this business.", "Chris Evans", "Thanks. And then you talked about raws and margin expansion a bit and maybe I missed it, but did you break out or could you break out what portion of that margin expansion was from raws?", "John Morikis", "Yes. What we prefer to say is when you look at the Comex integration, the ability for us to take those gallons through our own footprint and I think that's completed and gallon gains. You have the gallon gains over in Stores Group as well as Consumer Group, so those factors are well over half. We don't break it out in those -- we say those, that's the majority of the margin improvement and raws is just the smaller piece of that.", "Bob Wells", "Chris, the other thing is if there's a positive mix shift with Stores Group growing faster than any other segment, that has a positive effect on gross margin as well.", "Chris Evans", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Good morning, everyone. Nice quarter. You guys addressed a lot of the mix and margin questions with Paint Stores, but I want to make sure understand something. If you're looking at some of these protective and marine coatings, obviously they can sell for quite a bit more than the architectural.", "Is it right to assume automatically that they have a high margin and then what happens when we're dealing with the strong operating leverage in the architectural gallons? John, can you talk about how all that mixes together in the final margin number we see?", "John Morikis", "Yes. When you look at the protective marine that's going through the stores group, it's not very different. The operating margins, the SG&A and so forth, it's very close to the architectural business, but as you say, the costs are higher and the selling prices are higher.", "Bob Wells", "So that means the strength in architectural volume was really driving the train?", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Yes. Alright. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hey, guys. This is [Matt] [ph] in for Vincent. I was wondering if you could speak to the underlying demand environment in Canada and the impact Paint Store Group and Consumer there.", "John Morikis", "Demand in Canada has been spotty. With our new acquisition, Comex, rolling in now, we're excited about the future here. This brand that we bought in and the conversion we're going through offers us opportunity as we consolidate the general paint brand into our Sherwin brand. So, going forward it may in fact come from market share gains, but we're expecting to move forward in Canada.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Great. And then in terms of the impact of inventory cycles in the big box retailers, did you feel any effects from that throughout the quarter?", "John Morikis", "No. Nothing to speak of. No.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Dmitry Silversteyn of Longbow Research.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Good morning. I think a lot of my questions have been answered but I would like to follow-up on obviously the shortfall in revenues and your performance for the earnings line above the top end of the guidance you provided from the first quarter.", "What were the one or two sort of biggest differences between your expectations regarding cost for the margin side heading into the quarter versus what turned out to be the case?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think what it really came down to, Dmitry, was protected marine sales and secondly was the currency. The currency was -- we did not have the Brazilian Real getting close to 4 to 1 and those two things, but when we looked at what we thought we could do with the Comex integration and the selling price and the architectural side, it was pretty close to what original guidance was.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "So that's my question, Sean. You had revenues that were lower than you expected for a variety of reasons but your earnings were above the top end of your expectations or top end of your guidance, so something must have happened between the revenue line and the net income line.", "Sean Hennessy", "Okay. I think it was the SG&A control. No doubt about it. I think the gross margin might have been a couple cents different than we thought, but I think the SG&A increasing only $9 million in the quarter. I know the divisions has been working really hard to get that SG&A down and I think that is the operating margin difference.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Are those levels of SG&A spending sustainable when you see the business going forward or was this sort of a reaction to what you saw going on in the market with the currencies and demand and we can expect those SG&A levels to recover somewhat as you head into 2016?", "Sean Hennessy", "No, they are sustainable. Going forward, we believe we can continue to run.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "At these levels. Okay. Secondly, can you talk a little bit about it sounded like your pricing was relatively flat both in the core group and the consumer group. Can you talk about the impact on the mix, if you will, on the revenue lines from lower protective and marine coatings and whatever else may be driving that as well as the consumer line?", "Sean Hennessy", "I'm sorry, Dmitry. Bob mentioned that protective and marine accounts for low teens percentage of our stores business and by design these are products that sell for two and three times what a typical architectural product sells for.", "So a lot of that mix shift is coming as a result of the softness in that business. I think we've commented that pricing is holding up well. You're clearly seeing that in the margins performance, so with the exception of kind of that customer shift inside that business, there hasn't been a lot of mix.", "We did comment that the residential repaint customer continues to grow at a double digit piece for us. Those are good, solid architectural gallons for us at reasonable pricing and you can see the impact of that go into the chain.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. If I'm looking at the price mix components and assuming that your prices flat year-over-year, if I'm hearing sort of low single digits, negative mix is that sort of the right way of looking at it?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think that -- with one exception, Dmitry, and that is we've talked about competitive pricing in the large commercial project that has a little bit of a negative effect on a very small piece of the market but by far and away the largest impact on the difference between sales and volume was that negative mix from primarily protective and marine.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Got you. And then if I could follow up. I want to make sure I heard you correctly. Did you say that sales were approximately $40 million for the quarter for HGTV at Lowe's?", "John Morikis", "Yes. Because of the comment we made about relatively flat without and that's where the computation will get you to.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. That's down almost 60% from the second quarter which I understand benefited from that but if I'm sort of the $40 million number coming up with 150, maybe 200 from a prior quarter in the maybe warmer months, that's sort of low end, below the low end of the guidance that you issued for this business.", "So, are we sort of going to grow into this with a full paint season and maybe a couple more in 2016, 2017 or was there some level of disappointment with the performance of this product at Lowe's this season versus\u2026", "John Morikis", "It's on the low end of our range so, yes, we're disappointed. We strive to exceed that range, but going forward we have great confidence in our team and we have a great partner with a great relationship.", "As I mentioned we've added a SKU here that's an important SKU in the satin finish and we continue having great discussions about other opportunities, so I think you're right, we're going to grow into this and were excited about the future here.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. Very good. Let me follow-up. Typically when offers discounts and prices my understanding is [indiscernible] on the paint supply on a 50/50 basis more or less. I understand it's your agreement with Lowe's may be a little different. Are you participating in this by one get one free gallon offer that is going on at Lowe's right now?", "John Morikis", "We will not comment on that Dmitry. We don't comment about the specifics of any customer.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Greg Melich of Evercore ISI.", "Greg Melich", "Thanks, good morning, guys. Two questions. If you look at gross margin which was up 320 BPS for the Company, how would you break that down year-over-year between raws and mix shift, whether it be geographic or product? How should we think of that overall?", "John Morikis", "Greg, as an ongoing basis we have never broken price mix gallons out. What we try to do from an earlier question is we're saying that when you look at the 320 you have the Comex integration which was very positive for us.", "We've taken their gallons and their footprint through our footprint. I think also the increasing gallons of the Stores Group as well as the increasing gallons in the Consumer Group and also as we've always said that the Stores Group has the highest SG&A as a percent of sales, so when you look at the operating margins that means that the gross margins are the highest as we sell directly to the end user.", "As they become a bigger and bigger piece of the Company, that is going to create that mix. And then there was raw materials in there. Those are all the factors and what we said is if you look without -- raw materials really didn't drive this. It was the other three factors that drove it.", "Greg Melich", "So the order you gave them we should assume is a rough order of importance?", "John Morikis", "Yes.", "Greg Melich", "Great. The second question I had was a bit on the outlook and also what impact of the quarter. You mentioned wet weather delaying some construction. I know that was something that happened in the second quarter in June. Could you give us some ideas of where that is and how that might be looking as you look forward?", "John Morikis", "Yes, Greg. It looks very positive. We commented on the call that the residential repaint activity has remained strong. It's actually been strong for going on three years now and if you look at housing activity in general, there's a lot of reason to believe that the recovery is still in full swing.", "Household formations have been very strong and have remained strong. Existing home sales are up almost 8% year over year. Pending home sales up almost 10%. Average home values are pricing and continues to rise which is healthy for the industry, and on the new construction side it's even stronger with new home sales up almost 20% and single-family starts up more than 10%.", "Non-residential starts slowed a little this year, but the interesting thing this year there is that in 2015 despite it being down slightly from 2014, it's the second strong this year since 2008. We have back to back to back strong years of starts in nonresidential activity which is going to drive commercial painting in the years ahead.", "Greg Melich", "I guess I have one last one since we have Chris and John and the whole team there. There's enough turmoil going on in the world. Sometimes this is when opportunities really arise. Are there parts of the word that you think Sherwin should be more greatly involved where for the next year or two if it gets worse could be a good opportunity to enter? Thanks.", "Chris Connor", "We are always looking for those opportunities. That could be by customer or by segment and we keep a close eye on to those. As you should expect, our teams on the ground are empowered and pursuing those opportunities as they present themselves.", "Greg Melich", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ivan Marcuse of KeyBanc.", "Ivan Marcuse", "Thanks for taking my questions. Real quick on the consumer business. Why did margins continue to remain flat if you have higher volume and raw materials coming through? Why wouldn't you see some leverage there?", "Sean Hennessy", "Our operating margins in the consumer group were up 40 basis points in the quarter for the year. We said that the Lowe's business is fairly neutral. It's not accretive or dilutive this year.", "How with all the sales could you get the operating margin up? So I think you can imagine what kind of increase that has. That's really where -- I think it's a great positive story that again integration from Comex is creating that kind of value that the Lowe's business at close to zero operating margin is not affecting the total operating margins for the consumer.", "In fact, remember, at the beginning of the year many people thought that the Consumer Group would go backwards in operating margins because of that Lowe's business.", "Ivan Marcuse", "Great. And just a quick question probably for Sean, this is for you. Interest expense, if I did the math right, it looks like that was down a little bit. Why did interest expense jump and what would you sort of expect the run rate and is there any plans to add that, et cetera?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. In the month of July we issued bonds, took out the short-term debt. We issued $800 million at effectively 4%. That's $32 million. When you look at next year we expect that our interest expense will be higher as we term that out.", "You can imagine we were paying 20, 22 basis points for that $800 million in the short-term market and now we're at 4% with that, but we expect -- what we said is we think our interest expense will be up. In fact, Marybeth asked this question a couple quarters ago and that's about 20% next year.", "Ivan Marcuse", "The interest expense will be up 20%?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes.", "Ivan Marcuse", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rosemarie Morbelli of Gabelli & Co.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Good morning everyone and congratulations. Since most of the questions or all of the questions have been asked about the operations in the third quarter, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your new announcement, you're paint shield and give us a feel for the market size, how unique which may not be that unique, to have something. Can you touch on that particular basis?", "John Morikis", "Well, actually no one has a product like this. This is a very unique and exclusive and patented technology and it is a product that we are very proud of. The market size that you asked, it's a little hard to define as we're finding more and more opportunities for this. We look for the opportunities in schools, athletic facilities, in senior care facilities and hospitality settings, even in residential areas, wherever these infectious bacteria may exist we feel as though this product offers an application.", "And in a nutshell what we have here is our Company has successfully suspended compound in a paint product that will kill bacteria. It's very unique. If you look at the issues, the hospital space, it's quite an issue. The product that we have will kill 99.9% of staph, MRSA, E. coli, and a couple of other bacteria that really pose a serious challenge to our hospital and these other areas that we mentioned.", "To develop a product that does not just inhibit these microbes but actually kills bacteria is very unique and it's the first EPA registered product of its kind. So, there might be other products, but nothing like this.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "So you say EPA registered is that -- how do you go through that process? Is that similar to FDA or do you take already an approved bug killer, I can't pronounce any of those, that has been already approved and then you only need the EPA to approve the fact that you can actually put it in your paint?", "John Morikis", "No. And the way you go through this is very painfully would be my answer. It took us a number of years and quite an effort on our team's part. We are very proud of our team and the process that they went through.", "So, it is a product that is, as I mentioned, EPA registered. It's the first microbicidal paint that kills these bacteria. It lasts up to four years. We really believe this is a game changer in the industry. We're very excited about it. We had a wonderful launch yesterday and we're really looking forward to the opportunity that this product will present.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And you can't share more or less what your anticipation, revenues that can be generated from this product over the next I don't know, three or five years?", "John Morikis", "We just do not disclose that type of information. We're very excited though, I will say that. We're very excited.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Otherwise you wouldn't do it.", "John Morikis", "That's fair.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Thank you very much for your help.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay McCanless of Sterne, Agee.", "Jay McCanless", "Good morning, guys. First question I had is, and this is going back to the oil and gas and the protective, when the oil prices starting rolling over last fall did you see the gallons start to roll off at the same time or was there a lag effect and has that carried through to the last two to three quarters while oil prices have been coming down?", "John Morikis", "I would say there was a little bit of a lag. We didn't see it immediately, but it has accelerated recently.", "Jay McCanless", "Okay. And then could you disclose for global what percentage of that is going to be under the protective and marine and petrochemical, what percentage of revenues?", "Sean Hennessy", "Yes. We don't break that out, but I will tell you the majority of that is actually in the Service Group.", "Jay McCanless", "Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Roberts of UBS.", "John Roberts", "Chris, my thanks as well. Was all of the HGTV sales in the quarter sell-through or was there still some sell into the channel going on?", "Sean Hennessy", "There was no sell in, it was all selling out. It was through. There was no loading in.", "John Roberts", "And then some of your competitors talked about significant destocking in the retail channel at the end of the season. Were your gains in spite of seeing that or did you really not see much of that?", "Sean Hennessy", "We didn't see that.", "John Roberts", "You didn't see it. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Wong of Morningstar.", "David Wong", "Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just had one since a lot of them have been asked already. Can you give us a sense of your operating leverage that you discussed. Can you remind us what portion of your costs are fixed versus variable, especially on the SG&A line?", "Sean Hennessy", "On the SG&A line we've always said that a high percentage of our SG&A is fixed and we've always said that because we wouldn't open a store without a manager, assistant manager, the right to staffing model.", "When we open a store we consider a lot of that fixed and that's how we manage a company. We say if we're going to open a store, probably when I sit there and look at it, the way we look at it, almost 90% of it is fixed, 10% is variable.", "David Wong", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Nils Wallin of CLSA.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin", "Thanks and good morning, just about. I had a question on your top-line expectations for the fourth quarter. Obviously this year-on-year for the third quarter was kind of flattish and you're assuming some sort of growth maybe mid single-digits in the fourth quarter. What's the cause of that inflection point?", "Sean Hennessy", "I think if you look at the way, and we're guesstimating here on the foreign currency, but if you remember, fourth quarter is when it really started to fall off. If you think about the value of the dollar just jumped in the fourth quarter, so we comparisons get better, we don't think the currencies may get stronger, but just the comparisons get better.", "So we're seeing that. And just looking at the business and where we're at in the other areas. Someone said it earlier, even though there was a lag we did start seeing some of the protective and marine in the fourth quarter being negatively affected. We think those are the reasons you see the 1/10 going up to the mid low single digits.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin", "Understood. On the HGTV and Lowe's I know another participant asked about the buy one get one free, and I believe that was in the third quarter. It's continuing into the fourth quarter, so I'm just curious how you think about that in terms of brand recognition, brand quality. Will this type of discounting cause you to rethink how the brand will be positioned next year?", "John Morikis", "Again, this would be a better discussion for Lowe's. Their pricing of that product is something that they determine.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin", "Okay. And then just finally I guess in Global Finishes there was some degree of organic of weakness. Is there any market share shifts happening because others who are in the refinish business seem to still see some growth there?", "John Morikis", "In the automotive refinish business I'd say we do see some pressure there. There's a great deal of consolidation that's taken on in that space. We have found ourselves on the wrong side of some of the transactions that have taken place, so we felt a some pressure in our market share.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin", "And how do expect to address that?", "John Morikis", "Well, every day we're trying to address that. Our products and our services we think are good. We are trying to align ourselves with the right customers and ensure that the introductions that we have of both new products and our people are in the right place doing the right things at the right time.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin", "Great. Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Bob Wells for any closing remarks.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you again, Carrie. As always, I will be available for the balance of today, tomorrow, and throughout the coming week to answer your follow-up questions. I would like to thank you again for joining us this morning and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "This concludes today's presentation. Thank you for attending.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session; instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Bill Seymour, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "Good morning and welcome to our fiscal 2016 first quarter earnings call. We have two speakers today, Gary Hendrickson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Muehlbauer, our Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer. As always, after our prepared remarks, we'll have plenty of time to take your questions.", "Let me also remind you that comments made by me or by others representing Valspar may contain forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Our SEC filings contain additional information about factors that could cause actual results to differ from management's expectations. These filings could be found in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website at valspar.com.", "Also, please note that our reported results this morning include non-GAAP financial measures. These results should not be confused with the GAAP numbers in today's earnings release or with the GAAP numbers we will report in our Form 10-Q. For GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations, please refer to the supplemental schedules in this morning's news release.", "With that I'll turn the call over to Gary.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll provide highlights of our first quarter performance and discuss our outlook for the rest of the year. The results in our first quarter finished in line with our expectations. As we discussed on our Q4 call, we expected that the unique combination of several factors would present challenges in the first quarter. I'll let Jim remind you of those details later.", "But looking beyond these items, Q1 was a good quarter in terms of new business growth across our portfolio. We also continued to execute on our productivity plans, which helped contribute to improved gross margins in the quarter. The key takeaway is that the first quarter results were in line with our plan and we continue to expect growth in the balance of the year.", "So let's look at a few highlights from Coatings and Paints in the quarter. Our Coatings segment continues to perform well. We saw a modest decline in volume and sales, driven by tough comparisons to last year when volume was up 10%. We increased our net new business, EBIT grew 6%, and we improved our EBIT margins by 270 basis points in the quarter.", "Looking at the Coatings product lines individually, Packaging volume was up low single digits for the quarter on top of mid-single digit growth last year. Highlighting the quarter was continued strong growth in Asia and further growth in non-BPA coatings in both North America and Europe. We expect non-BPA conversions to continue in North America and Europe. And as the industry leader, we believe we are best positioned to take advantage of this dynamic.", "Our Coil product line volume was up mid-single digits in Q1, driven by significant new business wins in North America, Latin America and Europe. This performance follows many quarters of growth in coil. We continue to leverage our technology and service platform to strengthen our leading market share position globally. We further enhanced this position last week through the acquisition of ISVA Vernici, a European coil coatings manufacturer headquartered in Italy. This acquisition extends Valspar's sales and manufacturing capabilities in the $1 billion European coil market.", "Volume in our General Industrial product line was challenged by difficult comparisons to last year and certain end market headwinds. New business gains in Asia and Latin America were more than offset by market declines in the container and the ag and construction markets.", "In our Wood product line, volume increased mid single-digits in North America driven by new business wins. Volumes were down in Asia as we were up against 30% growth in Q1 last year. You may recall that last year customers accelerated orders in Q1 ahead of a new tax on solvent-based products in China that was introduced in Q2 last year.", "Overall, our Coatings businesses are positioned very well as we continue to leverage our diversified product portfolio technology leadership and strong pipeline of new business to improve growth and profitability.", "I'll turn now to our Paints segment. Starting, first, with North America Consumer Paints continuing the momentum of last year, sell-through of Valspar products was up high single-digits in North America. As expected, overall volume declined, reflecting the impact of the change at Lowe's and, in addition, volumes were impacted by customer reductions to inventory levels.", "Looking forward, we expect customer inventories to be more balanced with sell-through as we move into the paint season. As a reminder, exiting the first quarter, we have now substantially anniversaried the change at Lowe's, which will ease our comparisons in the balance of the year.", "Last quarter, we mentioned that we were net winners in recent line reviews with our retail partners. I'd like to highlight some of those new wins. We have several new initiatives with Lowe's that will be ready for this year's paint season. These include the launch of Cabot stain products supported by a full product range at Lowe's. We're also refreshing our merchandizing display space at Lowe's, which includes the addition of 20% more display space.", "At the Home Depot, after last year's successful test, we're rolling out an expanded line-up of Cabot stain for this season. And at B&Q, our brand continues to gain momentum. We're now partnering to expand our product range into several new categories with expanded shelf space in the store.", "So wrapping up on the Paints segment, Consumer Paints product line volumes in Europe were up double digits. Volumes in China and Australia were down in the quarter as we were up against strong double-digit comps from last year.", "And in our Auto Refinish product line, volume more than doubled in the quarter. This was driven by the impact of the Quest acquisition and from growth in our legacy Refinish business.", "As we exit Q1, our view of the fiscal year has not changed. In total, we do not expect much help from the overall economy; instead, we continue to focus on what we can control: our own execution, winning new business, and continuing to be more productive in everything we do. Based on our outlook, we have reiterated our guidance for fiscal 2016.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Good morning, everyone. Gary has covered the key business highlights for the quarter, so I'll focus my comments this morning on our first quarter financial performance and outlook for fiscal 2016.", "As Gary mentioned, Q1 results finished in line with our expectations. On last quarter's call, we highlighted that the first quarter would be our most challenging period of the year from a growth perspective. As a result, we expected sales and earnings to be down in the quarter. The anticipated decline in Q1 was embedded in our annual outlook and was the result of the factors we detailed during our Q4 call, including the impact of unfavorable currency translation which lowered Q1 sales by approximately 6% or $60 million and the EPS by $0.05 in the quarter.", "Second, the continued impact from the change at Lowe's, which we have now substantially annualized. Third, our Q1 results were up against exceptional performance in our Coatings segment last year, when volumes grew 10% and EBIT increased 16%.", "And finally, interest expense in Q1 increased $6 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of our bond issuances in 2015. We plan for these items and they explain the bulk of the decline in sales and earnings for the first quarter. Going forward, these items will have much less of an impact on our growth as we progress through the year.", "With this as context, let's move on to discuss the balance of our results in the quarter. I'll start with volume and sales. Total volume declined 8% and sales were down 13%. Acquisitions added 2% to volume and 3% to sales in the quarter. Total sales declined approximately 7% in constant currency.", "Looking at the top line performance of our two segments in Q1, Coatings segment volumes were down 3% and sales declined 3% in constant currency. These results were solid considering we were up against strong performance last year when Coatings volumes increased double-digit.", "Volume growth in Coatings was led by the Coil and Packaging product lines. This growth was offset by declines in General Industrial and Asia Wood where we are up against very strong performance last year and end market softness in container and ag equipment products.", "Moving to the Paints segment, Q1 volumes were down 20% and sales declined 15% in constant currency. The addition of Quest increased Paints segment volume and sales by 4% and 9% respectively during the quarter. The volume decline in Paints was primarily driven by the change at Lowe's and customer actions to lower inventory as Gary referenced earlier.", "In addition, we were up against challenging comparisons to the double-digit volume growth in Asia and Australia in the first quarter of last year. Wrapping up the Paints segment, volumes in Europe at B&Q increased double-digits and Auto Refinish volumes were up reflecting the addition of Quest and growth in our legacy business.", "Moving on to overall gross margin. We finished the quarter with adjusted gross margin of 36%, up 270 basis points. The improvement in gross margin was driven primarily by ongoing productivity programs, cost price and benefits from improved sales mix.", "Looking at expenses in Q1, operating expense dollars were up slightly. The addition of Quest was partially offset by the impact of FX. Given the reduction in sales, adjusted OpEx as a percent of sales increased in the quarter to 25.3%, bringing it all together, consolidated adjusted EBIT declined 20% and EBIT margin finished at 10.6% down 90 basis points.", "In the Coatings segment, adjusted first quarter EBIT of $97 million was up 6% and increased 270 basis points. The increase in EBIT was primarily driven by the benefits from productivity initiatives and cost price, which more than offset the decline in sales and the impact of currency translation.", "Paints segment adjusted EBIT of $4.5 million and EBIT margin of 1.5% declined from the prior year. This decrease was the result of lower volumes and the impact of foreign currency translation. These items were partially offset by positive benefits from productivity initiatives, cost price and the Quest acquisition. We expect to see improved EBIT growth in Paints in the balance of the year as the year-over-year comparisons ease.", "Moving on to a couple of other items in the quarter. Cash flow from operations was approximately $21 million for the first quarter, up more than $40 million compared to the first quarter last year. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate of 25.9% improved 360 basis points driven primarily by foreign tax credits and lower foreign tax rates. We continue to expect the annual tax rate will be between 30% and 31% for fiscal 2016.", "Wrapping up the highlights for the quarter, we paid $26 million of dividends representing a per share increase of 10% and repurchased 221,000 shares of our company stock for a total investment of $18 million.", "Moving on to the outlook for the balance of fiscal 2016, we expect the annual sales growth to be up mid single-digits in constant currency or up slightly on a reported basis including the estimated impact of FX. We expect fiscal 2016 adjusted EPS in the range of $4.80 to $5, which is unchanged from our previous outlook.", "With that, we'd like to open up the call for your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will go to line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first one is, on your Coating business, you continue to see some nice improvement in the year-over-year margins. How much would you, if you gauge, is raw materials versus the productivity that you called out? And if it's mostly productivity, do you expect to see a sort of the same year-over-year improvement as we move through the year?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Ivan, good morning, it's Jim. A large portion of the benefit that we saw in the quarter in Coatings was the productivity initiatives that we did last year. So as we move into the balance of the year, as we noted on last quarter's call, we're going to start to anniversary some of those more in earnest as we get into Q2, Q3 and beyond. So, we expect that year-over-year improvement to diminish.", "The other side of the equation is, certainly given the tough compares we had in the Coatings segment this quarter, those compares ease as we move forward. So we expect better volumes in the balance of the year, but the growth in margin rate will be less in the Coatings segment for the balance of the year as well.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "In terms of the new business that you called out in the Coatings, is that enough with your view of the macro environment to see \u2013 start seeing growth as we move through the year on a volume basis year-over-year?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Yes, it is Ivan. We're expecting \u2013 every one of the business \u2013 of our Coatings product lines is expecting growth for the full year.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then, just one quick question, in terms of the destocking that you called out in Paints, how much did that impact your P&L if you can quantify that. And should we see the reverse happen in the second quarter as the new business that you called out starts to roll through and be filled into the channel?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I'll give you the crib notes version on the quarter, Ivan, since you've asked a question both on Coatings and Paints. So Coatings came in right where we expected, maybe a little bit better. Paints came in a little bit below where we expected. And that was basically 100% attributed to inventory \u2013 lower inventory in North America than we had in the previous year.", "I wouldn't read much into that at all. Q1 is our lowest quarter for sales. Small movements in inventory levels can have a disproportionate impact. It wasn't a lot of money; it was a few tens-of-millions-of-dollars. Our sell-through in Paints in North America was very solid, again, this quarter. And we fully expect that our channel partners are going to refresh inventory to match sell-through as we go through the rest of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question goes to the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah. Hi. Gary, just to follow-up on that, can you quantify what that sell-through was in North America?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We did \u2013 yeah. Sorry, Bob, we did in my remarks that we \u2013 across the channels in North America, sell-through of Valspar was up high single digits.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thanks. Unfortunately, I got on late. And then, can you talk a little bit about any expectations you have in the Australian market with the change in ownership at Masters. Does that affect you at all, or has that become a small enough part of the portfolio at Wattyl that you won't really see a big impact?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, on a total company basis, Bob, it's de minimis. For the Australia consumer business, it was about $20 million of sales last year. So \u2013 also, the de minimis impact, given what we can do in terms of restructuring to deal with the smallish loss. So no impact in Australia that's of significance; absolutely no impact to the corporation.", "And let's see what happens. I mean, it's not \u2013 I don't believe that a decision has been made to shutter the doors on Masters. We're still supporting them. We're still selling them paint. And we're in a wait-and-see mode like everyone else is.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And is there any product line reviews possible in Canada when Lowe's acquires one of the leading home supply companies up there where I don't think you have much exposure today. Is that something that could be on the horizon?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Maybe, Bob, but way too early to tell. And to my knowledge, we haven't had any conversations about that, yet.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then, just real briefly, the initiatives you've had with Lowe's Pro, Ace and B&Q, couple of years into that from when you first announced them. Wondering if you can just give us a letter grade for the execution and results across those three platforms as you look back now?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think all three are more or less where we expected them to be. I mean, I called out, specifically, B&Q in my remarks that apparently you didn't hear because you joined a little bit late, but B&Q is going great. We've extended our product line into some new categories. We've got additional shelf space in the store. We called that out as about a $100 million opportunity for us. We believe that the run rate coming out of this year is going to be about $100 million.", "Ace is on track. The key dimension of the Ace program that we talked about last year that we needed to improve was the penetration of the Valspar brand into the overall mix of paint that's sold in Ace stores. That's improving. That's been on a good trend and we're about 500 basis points higher in that penetration today than we were at this time last year.", "And Lowe's Pro, I don't want to talk specifically about that, anymore, because the dynamics have changed there a little bit with the new entrant into the store, but we're very satisfied and pleased with the performance of our Pro program with Lowe's.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. Thanks for the help.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. Gary, in Coatings, would you expect volume growth to remain negative for Q2 and Q3, at least.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. No, we expect it to turn positive for the remainder of the year, Dave.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And in Coatings in earnings in Q2, should that be up at a similar rate we saw in Q1 as well?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We're not going to \u2013 we've historically and we'll continue not to talk about quarters, specifically. But Jim did mention earlier, David, that some of the margin expansion that we've seen in Coatings \u2013 a good deal of it was related to productivity programs that we had last year that start to cycle off as we move through the remainder of the year. So we're not going to see the types of increases that we saw in Q1 as we move through the rest of the year.", "David I. Begleiter - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Back to the question on the Paints sell-through of high-single digits in North America. Gary, can you just give us some more color on that? What price points, in particular, drove that? And where are you in terms of the own inventories just given that your comments on how your customers are managing inventories?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Ghansham, I'm not going to get specific because I think it's sensitive information whether it's for our retail partners and for us as to what particular products are selling well. But just say that the Valspar branded products as a whole, across channels in North America were up high-single digits. And we think that's stronger performance than any of our competitors.", "In our inventories, they're balanced. The paint season is a predictable thing for us. We know when our retail partners are going to start to order, we start to build inventory in anticipation of those orders. Nothing is different this year with the exception of, as I mentioned in my remarks earlier, that inventory levels across channels in North America a little bit lower than they were last year.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "That's helpful. And then just in terms of General Industrial, you called on mid-single digit declines. How does that breakout across your various regions? Thanks.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. The big one for us is the container coatings market in China, which is very weak. And the Ag and construction market really, broadly, which is weak as well. So, that's heavy construction equipment for mining, agriculture and construction. Those are the two weak spots in the General Industrial portfolio.", "But as I said today a bit earlier, we expect growth in our Coatings segment as we move through the year. We have the benefit of a very diverse portfolio across many geographies and end markets. And we think that we're going to be able balance some of that end market cyclicality with growth in other areas.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, our question goes to the line of Jeff Zekauskas, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning. In the quarter, you have this remarkable gross margins. But at the same time, your absolute level of SG&A expense was about flat year-over-year even though your sales declined, I don't know, 13%. So why were the overhead expenses so unchanged?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Two things, Jeff. And I mentioned a little bit of this in my prepared remarks. First is, we have the benefit \u2013 I'm sorry, we have the addition of Quest that we obviously haven't anniversaried yet in the business, which actually drove SG&A up, as you would expect. But that combined with the impact of FX in the quarter, remember, FX (23:18) shows up on the expense line as a benefit and Q1 was the biggest period of FX that was significant for the year. So, really that change in the SG&A was offset by reductions due to just the timing \u2013 or sorry just due to translation adjustment in FX.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. I guess for my follow-up, there has been some sort of delay or some sort of depletion of inventory. Is it the case? Can you talk about what your average prices were in the course of 2015 and how you expect your average prices in 2016? Is there some connection between the delay in orders and different pricing trends?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, no correlation whatsoever, Jeff.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will go to line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please go ahead.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, good morning. Couple of questions. First on Paints. You saw 640 basis points decline in margins despite what should have been a very favorable raw material benefit environment. I know you had decline in volumes, but maybe you can comment on that? And your customer inventory adjustment comment, all your competitors that have reported so far, nobody has mentioned that. So, maybe can you just sort of tie that in with your margin decline?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. I sure can P.J. So, to your first question around the rate of decline in EBIT margins, as you know, our first quarter, especially in our Paints segment is our smallest quarter of the year. And given the SG&A fixed infrastructure of the business, changes in the top line are going to dramatically impact the bottom line from a rate, EBIT rate standpoint. And that's what you saw. You saw the combination of the fact that we hadn't anniversaried the change in Lowe's yet. You had the impact of FX. And then you had the timing adjustment of inventories in North America. The combination of all of those on an already small quarter is going to have a disproportionate impact on rates in the quarter.", "Similar to the comments that Gary provided earlier really on inventory, I mean, it's Q1 we're outside of paint season. It's not unusual for us or others to have small changes at inventory between the quarters. Key thing for us is that our sell-through plans for the quarter came in line with expectations. Outlook for the balance of the year hasn't changed. So, we know that, as time goes on, inventories will match sell-through to keep product availability where it needs to be with our retail partners. So, you're going to have these timing adjustments once in a while. And we look forward to those inventories returning back to more normalized levels as we head towards (26:05).", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. And then Gary, in Refinish, you acquired Quest. Refinish has been a great business for lot of companies with steady margins. What are your long-term aspirations there? Thank you.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It was a great business for us before we acquired Quest, P.J., and it will be at least twice as good now that we own them. We doubled the size of the Refinish business that we had from about $150 million to about $300 million, which in the part of the market that we operate in, we feel is adequate scale.", "As we called out in, in our prepared comments, we grew the business this quarter, both the legacy business that we had and then obviously with the addition of Quest, it was significant growth. That acquisition, by the way, is right on track. The things that we plan to do to get synergies are occurring.", "We're very, very pleased with the team that we acquired with Quest. it's really solid and the people are really solid and complementary to ours. So, we couldn't be more pleased. The long-term goal for that business is, as I've said it, I think I've said it publicly is we expect that that's a $500 million business in about four years, five years time, up from $300 million last year.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital. Please go ahead.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. I was just hoping maybe you could characterize the operating environment in China right now. You noted some potential softness there as well as in Australia. What are you seeing from your customers and what do you expect going forward?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's really specific to the end-market, Arun. So our packaging business in China had another quarter of almost 20% growth. Part of that is structural growth in the market as the conversion from glass to cans continues, and part of it was market share gains for us. Our consumer business was a little bit weaker than it was last year, but that was against extremely strong comparisons in the first quarter of last year. Same was true with our Wood Coatings business. I called out the fact that we had a 30% growth in Q1 last year. So we didn't expect to have growth this year. I mentioned the ag and construction market in China, that's pretty weak. We were negative in that business this year and the container business is pretty weak.", "So, overall, I don't like to make comments about the overall market because we've selected markets that we think we have an opportunity to have long-term growth and have the opportunity to win in. But I will say, for our overall portfolio, we expect that we're going to have to take market share this year to get to the commitments that we've made to our board and our shareholders. So I'm not expecting a ton of growth from the overall market, but we do have some terrific market share opportunities that we expect to capitalize on.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then in North America, there has been a year or so of inventory corrections in the big box channel that various competitors have cited. I'm just curious, what do you think is going on? I mean is there a heightened level of competitive activity? Is there any difference that you see between that channel and others \u2013 I know you don't have exposure anywhere (29:53), but maybe you can just give me your overall thoughts on how the big box channel is evolving over the last year or two, and what you expect going forward?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't see any significant change. Yeah. So, we called out a modest inventory adjustment across channels. We weren't specific to a big box channel; we sell all channels in North America. And we were quite specific that it was across multiple channels that we saw a modest inventory correction. And as Jim said earlier, this is \u2013 for our quarter, which is a very small quarter, a modest change in inventory levels can have a disproportionate impact. So we felt that we should call it out. That's the reason we're talking about it.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "As I said to Ivan, I wouldn't make a big deal of this at all, because it's not.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Arun.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please go ahead.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Given your comments around high sell-through at your customers in North American Paints, it sounds like you're expecting a de-stock \u2013 excuse me, a restocking in the rest of the year. So should we begin to see some positive volume growth in your Paints business from the rest of the year, and is there any reason to expect that restocking not to occur?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah. Well, two things. We're going to see improved performance in the Paints segment, first and foremost, given the fact that we've anniversaried the change in Lowe's started in Q2. Our plans for the paint season really haven't changed. You saw our performance in North America last year with sell-through and we're expecting good performance this year as well from a sell-through standpoint, and inventories will balance themselves out to match that. What specific quarter it happens in and how that's through we'll have to see. But key thing for us is nothing has changed from our sell-through expectations in the North American business. And it's early, and we'll see how paint season goes.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Got it. And just on packaging, volumes up low-single-digits, but sales down low-single digits, ex-FX. Is there some sort of pricing issue or mix going on here or \u2013 kind of surprised that you see price declines when you're rolling out \u2013 you're still rolling out the BPA-free product?", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Yeah, Nils, there is a combination of things going on there. You correctly point out, as we roll into more non-BPA product, that has a favorable impact on price. But as we've noted historically, we've got a nice business with a number of customers globally and our contracts with those customers include pricing escalators and de-escalators over time. So, there is just a natural balancing that goes on within those contracts.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "The other factor, Nils, which has even greater impact in that is the growth is \u2013 most of the growth in the quarter came from Asia, and most of that growth is in beverage, which has a much lower price point than our food and general line product line does.", "So, Jim, I'm not sure that we have the exact breakdown on what all that is, but mix had a significant impact as well.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "That's right.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Great. And just a final one, if I may, where are you in terms of the tinting penetration at B&Q?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We're significantly higher than we were at this point last year. I don't know the exact number. You're going to have to get that from Bill, later.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Jim L. Muehlbauer - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer", "Thanks, Nils.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Vincent Andrews, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, this is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was curious if you had a sense for how sell-through in North American paints deferred between interior and exterior product lines?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, in the first quarter it's mostly interior, I think, because it's winter.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Well, that's fair. But I'm speaking more on a year-over-year basis and it was one of the warmest...", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We don't know. We don't know.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. It was something that you commented on in the past. But then to follow up, I was wondering if you could speak to the negotiations and dynamics surrounding price and how they've differed across your various coatings in the markets. Which sub-segment should we expect more resiliency or more pressure on a go-forward basis?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We have conversations with all of our customers on a regular basis about what the correct value proposition is for Valspar products. And so, to get specific on the nature of those conversations wouldn't be helpful, I don't think.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please go ahead.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on a couple of questions, if I can. When you look at your markets in China and Australia, I understand that the weakness in the first quarter had to do with difficult comps. But as you sort of take a look what's going on there economically and within your specific end-markets, how do you see those markets performing in 2016?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I answered this question in a way that's maybe not as specific as you want, Dmitry, because we can't predict. I mean we understand that the China market is not as strong as it was two years ago, maybe even last year, generally speaking. But we still have a small position in an extremely large market and we have good programs that should enable us to take market share. So when we put our plan together for the full year this year, we are quite specific internally and externally that we weren't expecting a lot of help from the macro and that we expected we'd have to generate our own growth this year. So that's the way our plans are put together if you're trying to develop or reference about how to evaluate Valspar's performance for the full year. Think about it that way.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And in Australia, I think the market is not materially different \u2013 the paint market is not materially different than it was last year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So, no incremental weakness or recovery in the housing market that would impact how you're growing in that region one way of the other?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's the way we're planning our year. That's right, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. With respect to B&Q, you talk about having double-digit growth there in your second sort of full year in that distribution channel. In terms of your sort of future opportunities with Kingfisher, what do you have to show in B&Q for this program to be deemed successful by your partner and perhaps position you to take the next up in expanding your position in Europe?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. That's a good question and one that I'm not prepared to answer in depth. But I will say that both we and B&Q are extremely pleased with the progress that we've made. And we thus far believes that this is a replicatable program through other parts of the Kingfisher organization. And I'll just say that I think if we continue to execute well, we'll given the opportunity", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Fair enough, Gary. And then one small question on M&A both in terms of sort of your focus going forward as far as either geographic or in more particular product type or end markets that you're looking to penetrate. And also, if you can comment on this recent deal announced between the Akzo and BASF's Industrial Coatings business whether or not that changes the market dynamics in Europe that can either help you or hold you back from gaining share and growing that business in Europe, especially since ISVA (37:45) acquisition gave you a much better footprint there.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we've actually done two things in Europe to enhance our position. We acquired \u2013 it was a small acquisition of a manufacturing facility that was doing tool manufacturing for us in coil coatings and had a small business to support our coil coatings business in Finland a few months ago. Not material so not reported. And then we just did the ISVA acquisition.", "Our Coils business in Europe has been performing extraordinarily well. And so we are out of capacity, which is the reason that we acquired the manufacturing asset. And we have commitments, hard commitments of significant new business from very large customers in the European market that are fully baked into our plans for this year.", "I think there'll be some incremental upside even from as recently as post close of the ISVA acquisition for some incremental business with some of their customers who are pleased that that business is owned by a multinational. So we're very, very happy with our position in the coil market in Europe.", "With respect to the acquisition that you just mentioned, I prefer not to comment whether that creates opportunities for us or not. I'll just say that we feel that we've got tremendous opportunities in the European coil market on the basis of what we own today.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Fair enough, Gary. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next, we will go to the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Gary, when you talked about \u2013 I mean your Refinishing business getting to about $500 million in revenues over the next four years to five years, are you including bolt-on or is that purely organic growth?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We think we can do that organically, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "And are there potentially additional acquisitions that can be attractive in that particular side of the business?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Yeah. There are some smaller ones there.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And then, I was wondering regarding and I know it is a small quarter and I know it is winter and so on, but I was wondering if, first of all, is the customer inventory correction on the Paints side was bigger than it was in previous year? And two, whether that shows that they're anticipating a slowdown in housing?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't think it shows that at all. In fact, the housing market in North America appears to be pretty strong. Again, Rosemarie, if this level of correction or if this level of change on a year-over-year basis happened in our Q2, we wouldn't be talking about it, because it would be immaterial. And it's really immaterial in Q1, but it has an impact on a very small quarter for us. So, we called it out.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. That was very fair.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "The only reason we called it out is because this quarter is an unusual quarter for us for many reasons and we thought it would be helpful to our investors to understand that our plan in Coatings is right on or above plan and in Paints was what would have been right on our plan \u2013 our internal plan, had it not been for this modest correction. That's the only reason we called it out.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. I'm glad you did, because I was freaking out looking at that margin.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you shouldn't freak out, looking at that margin for the reasons that Jim just said. We delever extraordinarily in the first quarter, because it's such a small quarter. And all of the costs that in our business remain in our business in the first quarter. If you look historically, the first quarter is always the weakest quarter that we have in Paints, and there's absolutely no reason to be freaked out about a 600 basis point decline in Q1.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hi. Can you hear me?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We got you, Mike.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hi. Gary, you're getting some increases in distribution of the Cabot Stain line in North America, how important could that be to the growth rate this year. And just looking at last year, were sales depressed in stains due to the weather?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the answer to your first question, Mike, is that it's \u2013 all of these, we knew about these opportunities as we went into our year, so they're baked into our guidance. Cabot is very broadly distributed now. I think it's something like 10,000 points of distribution in North America, which is by far the most widely-distributed premium stain product that is in our market. So, we fully expect that we're going to grow this business as we move forward through time. But at least for this year, as I said, it's baked into our guidance.", "Yeah. Last year, on your second question, whether we expect a better stain season this year than last year, I think we will unless we have \u2013 we had horrific weather last year and we missed a good portion of the stain season, which is March, April, May. Consumers have \u2013 if you don't get it done in May, a lot of people decide \u2013 by May \u2013 they decide to defer until the next year. So it's possible that we could see some upside on our plan based on weather patterns.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "All right. And then a question on China and just the consumer paint business, you've talked about increasing the number of distribution points in China. How should we think about that contributing to overall volume growth in Asia and sort of when should we see the increase in channels translate to an increase in volumes and some of the share gains that you're referring to?", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we've seen that over the last several years taking place. So that has been the ongoing formula that our team in China has been executing. As Gary mentioned, the unknown for this year is what type of headwinds are we going to have from a macro perspective. But once again, our share is very small in that marketplace and we have continued opportunities to grow. We know we just need to manage through these temporary headwinds and we'll continue to grow our brand there.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Gary E. Hendrickson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And speakers, there are no questions in queue, please go ahead.", "Bill Seymour - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations", "Well, that's it for the call.

Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 2.8% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $129.3 million in the quarter to $1.26 billion.", "Our consolidated gross margin increased 280 basis points in the quarter to 49% of sales from 46.2% in the first quarter last year. Most of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $73.2 million over the first quarter last year to $1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 38.9% in the first quarter this year, from 37.9% last year. Roughly half of this increase was from acquisition-related costs.", "Interest expense increased $13.3 million compared to the first quarter last year to $25.7 million. This increase resulted from the shift to long-term debt from short-term that occurred mid-year 2015 and acquisition related interest expense.", "Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $23.1 million to $216.4 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $9.4 million or 4.9%, compared to the first quarter last year.", "Our effective tax rate was flat at 32% compared to the first quarter of 2015. For the full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30% range.", "Consolidated net income increased $15.7 million to $147.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 5.7% compared to 5.4% in the first quarter last year. Finally, diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 13.8% to $1.57 per share from $1.38 per share in 2015.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2016 increased 10.5% to $1.62 billion from $1.46 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 9.4%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic paint and equipment sales across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter.", "Regionally in the first quarter, our Eastern division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Midwestern division, Southwestern division and Canada. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.", "Segment profit for the group increased $77 million or 43.6% to $253.5 million in the quarter, as higher paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 15.7% of sales from 12.1% in the first quarter last year.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars decreased 24.7% to $125.2 million due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases.", "Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 22.2% in the quarter. Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $900,000 in the quarter from a profit of $9.5 million last year.", "Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs, and unfavorable currency translation, partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation decreased Latin America's segment profit $6.2 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was a loss of 70 basis points in the quarter compared to a profit of 5.7% in the first quarter of 2015.", "Turning to the Consumer Group, first quarter sales increased 7.5% to $378.1 million. As a reminder, in March, we annualized the start of the initial shipments of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program to Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 of last year.", "Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $8.6 million to $64 million in the quarter from $55.4 million in the first quarter last year. The profit improvement in the quarter was due primarily to improved operating efficiencies and higher sales volumes. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 16.9% from 15.8% in the same period last year.", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 3.3% to $454.2 million in the quarter as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 4.7% in the quarter.", "First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $9.7 million or 24.9% to $48.6 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $3 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 10.7% from 8.3% in the same period last year.", "That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So I'll now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. First quarter 2016 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. Architectural paint volume growth in North America was the strongest we've seen in the past 10 years or longer. Industrial coatings demand also picked up some momentum in North America and Europe. Even with a 2.8% drag from unfavorable currency translation in the quarter and continued soft market conditions in Latin America, our consolidated sales growth exceeded 5% for the first time since third quarter 2014.", "To get a clearer picture of our profitability, you need to back out the acquisition-related costs we recorded in the quarter. Ex acquisition costs, diluted net income per common share increased 31% on sales growth of just over 5%. As a percent of sales, gross profit expanded 280 basis points year-over-year.", "Operating profit improved 300 basis points and profit before tax improved 190 basis points. Our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 48.6%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales, the result of higher SG&A spending by our Paint Stores Group and the acquisition-related expenses.", "Both our domestic operating segments delivered strong results in the quarter. Paint Stores Group recorded double-digit revenue growth in four of the five customer segments we track, led by residential leasing, new residential and DIY. Comparable store sales growth of 9.4% was the strongest comp performance we've seen in the few years. Our optimism is fueled further by our professional contractor customers reporting very healthy order book trends that extend well into the year.", "During the quarter, Paint Stores Group opened 20 new stores and closed seven redundant stores. But plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada, and Caribbean stand at 4,099, compared to 4,010 a year ago.", "Consumer Group's 7.5% sales increase and 110 basis point improvement in the segment profit margin in the quarter, primarily reflected strong results from our national account customers. Sales to commercial, industrial and MRO customers also showed good progress in the quarter. Strong sales growth and volume-driven productivity gains by our global supply chain organization resulted in a very healthy 32% profit margin on incremental sales from our Consumer Group in the quarter.", "Unfavorable currency translation continued to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and our Latin America Coatings Group. Global Finishes Group did report positive volumes and positive sales in local currencies, driven primarily by improving marketing conditions in North America and Europe. They also managed the expenses very well, resulting in an impressive 240 basis point expansion in segment operating margin.", "Sales volumes in most Latin American countries continued to decline, with Mexico standing out as the notable exception. The impact of currency devaluation once again was worse than anticipated in the quarter.", "Our net working capital increased in the quarter due to the strong upward inflection of our business in the first quarter, evaluated over the trailing 12 months of sales. This increase in working capital resulted in a net operating cash use of approximately $80 million in the quarter, compared to a use of about $55 million in the first quarter last year.", "Our capital expenditure in the quarter totaled $52 million, depreciation was $42.9 million and amortization was $5.8 million. In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million, and amortization of about $30 million.", "Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016, as we complete some facility renovation projects. During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On March 31, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares.", "As we indicated on our call announcing the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal. This along with the cash required to service the debt after the close, will significantly curtail our share repurchases for the foreseeable future. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.", "As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, North American architectural paint demand is strong, driven by a steadily increasing level of residential construction and remodeling activity. As we move into the prime painting season, we're also encouraged by growing signs of a more robust non-residential recovery and improving demand for many industrial products. This growth will continue to be offset to some degree by challenging conditions in Latin America and currency headwinds, particularly in the first half of the year.", "Our outlook for second quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, a 9.5% increase at the midpoint compared to last year's record $3.70 per share.", "For the full year 2016, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are raising our expectation for full year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $12.50 to $12.70 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and now we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Good morning, Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, in recent quarters you called out some of the non-architectural end markets within PSG is being challenged. Just curious as to how these markets performed during the first quarter? Just wanted to understand why there was such a meaningful acceleration in 1Q sales trends in that Paint Stores Group have been?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We've spoken about the commercial side that we feel pretty good about that, Ghansham. The area that we've spoken of having some pressure would be the Protective & Marine business. Particularly in the Protective side here, if you break down the areas that are impacted by the oil and gas, that's probably had no significant impact. We have seen other areas that we've increased our focus on start to pay greater dividend, and we are excited about the results that we are experiencing as a result of those impact, of the actions we are taking.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then in terms of full-year sales guidance, I guess, why not raise that higher given your big first quarter and also strong sales guidance for the second quarter, particularly with FX easing as the year progresses. You expect any sort of moderation during the year in PSG?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "No. I think that what we expect is the Paint Stores Group will continue to lead the sales gains for us. I think second quarter is going to be in the same situation we're going to see the Paint Stores Group. I think that the first quarter, many years, we don't even change the guidance after the first quarter because it is the smallest quarter. We did raise the EPS. I think that we'll review it at the end of the second quarter. I think this year, if you remember, I think that Consumer had a very nice first quarter. We'll finalize the load-in -- anniversarying the load-in of the HGTV program, and I think that \u2013 so we've got that sort of a headwind a little bit in the second quarter, specifically about the second quarter, but make no mistake about it. I think the Paint Stores Group is where we've \u2013 as John said in his comments, I think the Paint Stores Group will lead us in the sales gains each and every quarter.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would say the customer base that we enjoyed relationships with inside their stores organization are feeling pretty bullish about the outlook this year.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Perfect. Thanks so much, guys.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Ghansham.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Perfect. Thank you. It obviously appears the spring season is already off to a solid start on reconstruction R&R. But can you also comment on the competitive environment in the big boxes and also any preliminary expectations for Infinity?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The big-box environment is always competitive. We expect that our role there is to continue to add value to all of the customers that we serve, and our job is to make sure that we're aligned with their goals and driving customers into their stores. Regarding Infinity, it's our practice to let our customers speak to what their expectations are. We have very high hopes. It's a really terrific quality product in that can, and our expectations would be that's going to be very strong. But, we don't want to get ahead of our customers.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Perfect. Thank you. And then just a quick follow up. Obviously, it's still early, but do you have any new color on the Valspar approval timeline, now that the process has begun, just any reminder there will be appreciated? Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we've begun the review process, and when we announced the acquisition, we committed to provide you with updates, and we had material \u2013 if we had material news, we really have no material news to update right now. And I think it's only fair to say that, our thoughts are that when there is a material update that we'll provide that, but given the day-by-day or play-by-play will be a bit much. Our thoughts are to keep you up to speed with material actions.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "That's appreciated. Thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the gross margin? You mentioned the incrementals as they flow through the P&L statement, but the gross margin particularly is pretty fantastic. What should we expect as you go through the rest of the year there?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Bob, this is Sean. I probably should have said that last time I answered, but this is Sean. And when you take a look at how our gross margin was last year, and if you look at the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter, how strong it was, if you think about the way the raw materials were moving last year, we felt that at the beginning of the year was really where we were going to have to make most of our improvement in the gross profit as a percent of sales and the improvement. We were \u2013 last year we were at 46% in the first quarter, we jumped all the way to 48.8% and then we got to 49% and then over 50% in the last three quarters.", "So, we feel good about where our gross margin is. We think that the raws will continue to \u2013 the raws goodness will continue to shrink and we're going to hit at length somewhere later in this year where we expect that that will be negligible, so. We felt that we had to have this kind of an improvement in the first quarter to have improvement throughout the year and we feel good about where we are with the gross profit.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then, maybe related to that, I think last year you talked about in some of the contractor bids there was a little pressure, but you've articulated today some building momentum in those markets as well. Can you characterize how the pricing dynamic is in the professional painter market at the moment?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I'd say it's very similar to what we've always expressed and experienced. We have spoken about those larger projects that typically go to bid and are a little more aggressive in pricing. But outside of that I'd say it's always a competitive market and it continues to be and we continue to try to differentiate ourselves, not only with the quality of the product, but the services that we provide. But, we expect that our competition will be out there and we've got to earn every gallon that we sell.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, John.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Good morning, fellows.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Duffy.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Question just around raw materials. Could you split them out a little bit, talk about the organic and inorganic side? Obviously with oil moving higher, has there been a material change in how you're thinking about raw materials throughout the rest of the year?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "On the petroleum-based side, we primarily priced off propylene and chemical-grade propylene has averaged around $0.30 a pound for a while now. Barring no major outages in propylene or monomer production, we anticipate a relatively flat polymer pricing market for over the balance of the year probably.", "On the titanium dioxide side of the equation, we said on our year-end call that we saw prices kind of flattening, but we didn't see a lot of pressure in supply demand balance. Those fundamentals have pretty much played out as we expected. There is obviously a December price increase announcement that we think may be gaining some traction amongst smaller customers, another price increase announcement has been stacked on top of that. We do believe that it's going to take tight market conditions, or tighter market conditions, for those price increases to gain significant traction. But I think it's safe to assume that we're not going to see further declines in TiO2.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. And then just on the back of that, if let's say oil moves a little higher and you get a little pressure on raw materials, philosophically as we get into next year, would you guys be able to go out with price increases do you think if raw materials were moving higher?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Duffy, our practice has always been to talk to our customers first. So, if we do that it will be \u2013 we'll talk to you about it after we've shared that with our customers. I think the band that gross margin chart that we often talk to that demonstrates our ability to operate in that band, I think is where I would point you. In areas or times where we've had significant pressure, we've been out with price increases, and I think it also demonstrates the discipline that we have when there haven't been raw material increases for us, not to go out with price increases. And so, our first effort is to mitigate or drive more efficiency and drive down the costs, anyway we can to avoid having to put price increases in. But if we find ourselves in that situation, I think we've also demonstrated our ability to put those effective price increases into the market.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, fellows.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Duffy.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Good morning.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just a question on weather. If you look at the last four quarters, particularly the first three, we had some challenges, and then 4Q last year was helpful. This first quarter seemed to be, the feedback we got, was somewhat mixed. So, against all that sort of sequential rollercoastering, where do you think things are now? Do you think the quarter and the performance in the Paint Stores Group is really reflective of sort of state-of-the-art instant demand? Or do you think we're still making up lost gallons from last year, or is there any risk that we pulled some forward from later this year?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think demand in our stores clearly improved from fourth quarter to first quarter. How much if any of that was due to the mild weather in the first quarter is really very difficult to determine. I would say this that we're very encouraged about the comments that we are getting from our customers. They're very bullish about the paint season. As I mentioned in my comments that the discussions that we're having with them, they're feeling very good about the market, and that keeps us very excited and focused on growing with them. So it's hard to say how much if any, but most importantly, their outlook for the year is very positive.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And just as a follow-up, the guidance you gave at 4Q presumably included some share repurchases. Is that correct? And if so, could you quantify how much do you think you took out in the new guidance?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I will just tell you that at the beginning of the year we did have share repurchase. I think, the guidance \u2013 when we take a look at \u2013 I'll go back to some of the comments John made in his comments. Our plan has changed. Our plan is to accumulate cash. In prior years, we always utilized that cash, our plan was to utilize 100% of the cash. And this if you think about what we're trying to do with the acquisition and acquire and accumulate cash for that closing of the Valspar deal, implies very little cash is going to be used for buybacks and \u2013 versus you probably \u2013 we're looking at spending another $700 million, $800 million, $900 million on stock. So, it probably was significant. And you can pick what you think the average purchase price would have been for the year.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. We'll do that. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yes. Thank you. John, I just want to go back to your views on the architectural paint market. I know, last year, we had subpar growth about 2%, 2.5%. So, as you look at what your customers are telling you, what kind of gallonage growth do you see for the industry in the U.S. this year? And given that outlook, I'm wondering why you only have mid \u2013 low to mid single-digit sales growth expectations for Q2? I know you're running some tougher Consumer Group comps, but it would seem that, especially with the weather snapback in Q2, that that PSG should have a very strong performance?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. And this is Sean and I'll let John talk about the market in total. And I just go back to some of the comments I made earlier about the guidance. I think when you look at the second quarter, we've got other things moving; currency is still going to be a little bit of a headwind. We're going to finally have 100% of the load-in from the HGTV program completed. But, we want to make sure you know that Stores Group is going to be the driver in the second quarter, just like it has been for the last many quarters or so.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And, Don, just, so I'll make sure I get your question right, were you referencing first quarter or second quarter?", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I was referencing second quarter just low to mid single-digit revenue growth, but just wanted to also get your comments on your outlook for the industry architectural volumes for the year as a whole, how much \u2013 we had subpar growth last year, what kind of a growth are you seeing this year?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. We don't forecast those gallons specifically, but I would tell you that in speaking with many of our customers around the country, there is a general sense of confidence and a bullishness that is very exciting to us. Many of them are looking at the book of business that they have and are excited about the outlook for the year. So we're going to be very responsive to them and try to ensure that we're the benefactors of that, but our customers are feeling very good, very good.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Don.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Arun.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. I guess I just wanted to ask that question again. You had very impressive same-store sales growth in the first quarter. You guys have been comping kind of 1.5 times to 2 times the industry, so would you say the industry was up 5% or 6% in the quarter? Or was there something specific that drove you guys well above the industry? And then, do you expect your numbers to kind of continue in that range?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Arun, this is Bob. When we do \u2013 when we estimate industry volume, we typically do so in part by listening to the reports of our publicly traded peers, and along with our volume growth, and triangulating to get what we estimate to be the market growth. For one quarter \u2013 for first quarter, it's a little too early to tell because we haven't seen enough market data yet, how much the market grew in the first quarter. Going forward, our expectations are based not on any macro assumption for market growth. But as John indicated on the feedback that we're getting from our contractor customers on their order book volume.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. We're working very closely with them on the projects that they're looking out and estimating, and many of them have already booked, and they're feeling, as I said, very positive about the year.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "It appears that the industry growth accelerated in the first quarter, but I think it's \u2013 ours certainly did, but it's a little too early to make a call on the industry at this point.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Great. And maybe you can also just give us an update. Are you seeing the price increases in TiO2? I know you described it's safe to assume that prices aren't going to go any lower. But, why are the producers actually having any success with increases if supply demand is still in your favor? Thanks.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "I think the simple answer to that is because they may be getting some price increases justified solely on the poor financial health of the industry. We do not believe the supply demand fundamentals support the increases that are in the market today. But I \u2013 at the very least I think it's safe to say that the increases in the market \u2013 the announcements that the producers have made have stopped the downward trajectory in TiO2 pricing. We said a few quarters ago that it felt like TiO2 was approaching a bottom and clearly there is a bottom in the market and we think we're there. We would expect flat pricing as probably the best case scenario and whether these price increases gain traction as we go forward, time will tell.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Our TiO2 costs are still down significantly year-over-year because of the downward trajectory over the course of 2015.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thanks. If I could just one more just on the non-paint sales in your Paint Stores, could you just describe what you're seeing there in the spray equipment and so on? Thanks.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Very positive numbers. We're having \u2013 in spray equipment, ladders, applicators, across the line we're having a very good performance. It gives us the confidence about the future.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Arun.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, good morning.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, P.J.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "John, you mentioned that the contractor order book is quite strong. Is that driven by a residential business with repair and remodel or is it more driven by commercial side of things?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's actually both sides.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Can you drill down a...", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'm sorry P.J. I thought you were done.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "No, no, I'd just say, can you drill down a little bit on the commercial and industrial side? Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. I'd say that it's on both sides of the business, both the residential and the non-res. The confidence in our contractors and the discussions that we have going with them are very positive on both sides.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "And just as a reminder from previous calls, while it certainly appears that non-residential starts are slowing in late 2015 and early 2016, we are \u2013 our business tracks more closely with project completions. So, we're painting project that were started more than a year ago and the pace of starts in 2014 and the first half of 2015 were very healthy. Those are the projects we're on now. And looking forward if you believe the Dodge forecast, non-res starts should be healthy this year and for the next couple of years.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And a quick question for Sean. Sean, you always said that your costs tend to lag oil prices by two quarters to three quarters. So with this recent move in oil price, do you expect maybe later in the year that you begin to see your costs sort of begin to inch up? Thank you.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. And I think that was what I was trying to imply when the question came up about the gross profit and the incremental profit in the first quarter versus the remainder of the year. Again, we \u2013 gross margins in the first quarter was benefited from the paint volume and our North American supply chain and the mix towards paint service group. The raw material deflation was a material factor, and we think that material factor will continue to diminish as we go throughout the year, and I think a lot of \u2013 the basket in total, which the oil is part of.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, P.J.", "P.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Mike.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "I was curious if you could comment on what impact the timing of the Easter holiday may have had on your sales? Presumably that would have been a drag year-on-year on contractor sales, but maybe a positive for DIY?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that's a pretty good thought. The DIY I think was probably strengthened by the change from the second quarter to the first quarter, and the contractor and that period we had a couple of days where it was probably depressed because of the Easter holiday.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "And then, I was also wondering if you could comment on the efforts that you're making at Lowe's to get the paint department employees a little more familiar with the HGTV HOME product line? Can you maybe give a little bit of detail on what your expectations for underlying volume growth will be adjusted for the load-in that we're lapping here?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I can certainly talk about our efforts there in Lowe's. We're choosing not to talk about the gallons or forecast or our customer. I think it's only appropriate that we let them speak to those expectations. But that said, our efforts are I think right on track. We have continued to work on training the Lowe's associates and making them familiar with our products. We had a terrific opportunity with the introduction of the Infinity product that you mentioned to get some of the product out into the hands of the Lowe's associates applying some of it, and making them familiar with the product. The process of training them on our entire product line as well as colors continues, and we're feeling pretty good about the momentum that we have there.", "Our goal is clearly to \u2013 and has always been to focus on driving customers into all of our customers, and you're asking specifically about Lowe's, our goal is to drive customers into that department, make sure that the employees there are very familiar with every aspect of our product and our color systems, and we think we're well on our way.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Thanks very much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious about Consumer, I know there's been some moving parts in there besides Lowe's in the past. But when you break out Lowe's and the load-in and the new products, is there a reason that it's not seeing any sort of organic growth?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Actually our experience in organic growth, if you \u2013 in Consumer, we had January and February sales this year with no history from Lowe's. As I mentioned in my opening comments that we are experiencing a good traction in many segments within that business unit. So, we're actually feeling very good about the momentum that that business unit has.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "The entire national account category is doing very well. And John also mentioned industrial MRO customers are up year-over-year.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Got it. Thanks. And then, in your 9% or so same-store sales in Paint Stores Group, how much of that was the new SKUs being pushed through the legacy Comex stores?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We feel very good about those stores, and what we said and have said is that, we believe we're going to have a 100% of our purchase price cash and all that would be cash neutral. And actually I think we're going to beat the third quarter. We probably said in the third year anniversary, which would have been this September, we're going to have a 100% of our cash back. We're probably going to be quicker because those stores are doing very well. It's \u2013 but now they're fully integrated, and it's hard for us to breakout results, Comex stores and non-Comex stores, but I can tell you, when you look at the markets they're in, they're doing well.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And I would add to that though, I think it's getting specifically to your question, bringing those high-end products into those stores has been a definite win to those stores in the market and our customers. In many cases, the portfolio of products that they were offering to many of those Comex stores were more focused on the new residential side, less on the DIY side. So, to your point, as we introduce the residential repaint and DIY customers into those stores at the higher end band of our product line, it's certainly helping us as Sean has discussed there.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And one final point on that Nils. Just keep in mind when you're asking the impact on comps, you're talking about roughly 275 stores on a base of 4,100. So it's not really that significant.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Yeah. Fair point. Thanks. I'll pass it along.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning guys, and congratulations on a solid start to the year.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Couple of questions that I want to follow-up. First of all, when you talk about your Latin American business and obviously it's challenged by all kinds of things. But, I'm interested in sort of which raw material pricing has been going up, I knew that impacted margins. And also, sort of what's your outlook like for the volume performance of that business, it's been comping down volume for a couple of quarters now. Is it sort of industry related or are you deemphasizing growth in that market, sort of kind of what's going on with the volumes there as well as raw material costs?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd like to just talk about the deemphasizing growth question, and then I'll turn it over to Sean. The answer is no. We're not ever deemphasizing growth. There are some things to your point in the market that we can't control and there are a lot of things that we can control, and we're working very hard on those things that we can control to better position ourselves in the market. I'll turn it over to Sean to answer the rest of your question.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, back to the \u2013 one of the parts you asked about the raw material cost and the cost of goods sold going up in Latin America, it's 100% currency and I'll tell you why. The Global Finishes Group is doing a great job looking for efficiencies and we're doing fine there on the conversion cost. But, Latin America buys the majority of its raw materials in U.S. currency and dollar denominated, and when you look at it, the currencies devaluation has the same effect on the raw materials as inflation.", "So the raw materials really are negatively affected by that currency. When you ask about in total what are you thinking about on the conditions down there. We don't expect to see improved economic conditions in the region in 2016. I think we've been consistent with this for a long time. I mean, we think that applies to currency and volume demand. We're starting to see currencies change a little positively. The Brazilian real went from about R$4.10, we thought it could get close to R$4.25, now it's down in the R$3.50, R$3.60. But in U.S. dollars, are very close to the breakeven levels. And so, our plan for 2016 calls for this segment to report a profit, but lot is done outside the realm of possibilities, and there's a risk of negative results for one or two more quarters just like the first quarter.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got you. That's helpful, Sean. Switching quickly to Stores Group. Since you've increased your Canadian exposure there, there's been a little bit of a foreign exchange headwind there. Can you talk about sort of what the magnitude of that was in the first quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I can tell you exactly. I think that \u2013 just give me a second here, Dmitry. I thought I had it right here. All right, yeah. It was \u2013 it's very small, it was just over $4 million, three-tenths of a percent of sales, but...", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So we're pretty happy the way Canada is going, Bob in his remarks, so Canada is coming on for us pretty good.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We've got a good team up there, dedicated on Canada, Western Canada with the influx of the acquisition of General [Paints] has given us a new platform up there, a lot of competition up there as well. But we're working hard in earning our space there.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Got you. Thank you very much, gentlemen. That's all the questions I had.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Dmitry.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good morning, everyone. Great quarter.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Chuck.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "I'd like to just revisit the Paint Stores Group performance a bit, 9% comps growth. Any help in price per gallon there either from a few price increases getting through or the average price per gallon sold, improving maybe because the industrial is getting stronger?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "You know, Chuck, when you look at it, just want you to know we haven't really had a price increase in Paint Stores Group since 2014. So the price did not help us at all. The deterioration of what was happening to us last year because of the Protective & Marine, John's comments earlier told you, we didn't have as much of a headwind there. But it was just solid volume growth there.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right. Do you think any of that's market share growth, could the market have been growing that strongly?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We believe, I think we believe if you take a look at it, I think we'll know later in the year. Bob mentioned when some of the other public companies may \u2013 we'll get there and look at their results, but we feel pretty good about the way that Paint Stores Group has developed with the products, the distribution and people. We feel pretty good that we're taking market share.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's some pretty good programs, Chuck, that we're executing on very well. And I have to hand it to our leadership team there as well as our team in the field. They're doing a terrific job of really by market finding those customers that offer opportunity and really earning their business. And we're proud of that team and expect that it's going to continue, that momentum will continue.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "John, are you speaking of the field reps, and is that reflected in the somewhat higher SG&A spending, I think Sean mentioned earlier?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we do have some stores that have an annualized and reps. So, we're investing in there because we're feeling very good about the momentum that we have. So, yeah, I'm speaking to the new reps and new stores, but that's a big base. We've got a lot of stores and sales reps that have been out there for some time, and they're really embracing the new programs and initiatives that we have to grow market share as well as introducing our new products to our customers, who are responding favorably.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right Thank you. Best of luck for the rest of the year.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Chuck.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Chuck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking. Real quick, what were the gross profit changes in the segments?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Give me a second, I got it right here. Paint Stores Group was up $122 million. Consumer was up $15 million. Global Finishes was up $5.2 million and Latin America was actually negative $12.7 million.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. And then environmental costs were bumped up. Is there anything special in there or is it just sort of the timing of how these things flow through?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Actually, we had an accrual for the Passaic River, it was specifically the Passaic River, there was, I think, negotiations going on between the EPA and the consortium of companies that will be involved in the clean-up. We're a very, very, very small piece, and there was a major change in what the clean-up on the Passaic River is going to be. So even though we're less than 5% player in this Passaic River, all of a sudden we have increased our accrual by $17 million. So you could imagine the total cost went up dramatically. And so the plan is now in place and we'll start doing it, and we believe we have the majority of the expense for the Passaic River now covered.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And you may have said this in the beginning of the call and I may have missed it, I apologize if I did, interest expense. Are you planning on issuing any debt before Valspar closes, and do you expect the interest expense to sort of maintain where it's at right now, or how do you expect debt to go up and down?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right. I think that we do not plan on issuing debt before the close. We've put our bridge in place. We've put a term loan in place; so our acquisition financing is in place. The first quarter, you see the expense was really more involved with the bridge financing. But the second quarter and beyond, we're going to have the term loan in there also. So that's why acquisition financing is in place.", "What we have done is put some interest rate swaps, I mean treasury rate locks and so, in the Q, you're going to see that we've entered into a series of treasury rate locks on a confined notion amounts of $1.7 billion. We will go higher than that. So we have taken some of these interest rate changes risk off the table and throughout the year depending on the say, you'll see us take some more off the table.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Ivan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Good morning, Rosemarie.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "If I \u2013 Sean, if I understood you properly, you have made up the gap in the gross margin in the first quarter, and if we keep the following three quarters at a flat level with last year, then we should be higher for the full year. So do you \u2013 is that more or less the trends you're expecting or do you think that Q2 gross margin will still be above last year?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that we should have a slight positive, we will be positive in the second quarter. I think for full the year, I think that we \u2013 your characterization of flat to \u2013 we in that area, I think that after the second quarter, after we see some raw materials I think we can give you a better picture on what we think the gross margins, we'll narrow it down. But, I think, your characterization of the full year is probably pretty good.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Thanks. And you mentioned that you were focusing on other areas outside of the oil and gas industry and were successful. Could give us a better feel for what you are doing and where?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would just say that we look at the industrial business regularly and we try to find those opportunities that offer us both the \u2013 opportunity to move gallons, but also bring solutions to our customers and we've really identified some of those that that we really have some unique technologies too that help provide solutions in getting the assets back in service quicker, to provide protection against various ambient conditions and we have good momentum. Rosemarie, I'd rather not get into any of the specifics of where they are, we'd rather just put the points on the scoreboard right now.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Sure. And if we look at your existing customers in that category and, I'm thinking the Deere, the Caterpillar type of companies. Are you seeing an improvement there or are we still in the doldrums?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd say our relationship with them is improving with many of those heavy equipment. The business itself I'd say their outlook, I think they have spoken to us to how their business is performing.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "All right. So no change? Thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Rosemarie.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Hi, good morning, or close to good afternoon. Just real quick, any notable difference between your exterior gallons and interior gallons in the Stores Group this quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Exterior had \u2013 I mean we had a good interior and we had a very good exterior. So, exterior were strong.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "So, Sean, within the guidance maybe just help us to see that, that \u2013 potentially that normalizes, how do you guys think about that? Is there still easy comparables through the balance of the year or is there some risks that some of that got pulled forward?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We've been talking about this and it's interesting. You go back to after last second quarter last year, if you remember, because of the weather in the second quarter and so forth and we saw a really nice comp gain in the fourth quarter, and people talked about the weather there, this quarter, you've heard different customers say that they had the opportunity to catch up and including builder. So, we're sort of interested in that situation. I think the second quarter is going to draw \u2013 give us a complete vision of that.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But I would say, going back to the comments I made earlier, Scott, that the takeaway that I have, or the confidence that I have revolves around the book of business that these customers are referencing as to going forward. So, to Sean's point, we may have had some that got pushed back, we may have had actually some that got pulled forward, but they are feeling good about what they're looking on the pipe and they're saying, it looks good.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jay McCanless with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee", "Good morning, everyone. Just one quick question. With the flooding that we've seen in Huston and some of the heavy rains we continue to see in Texas, what impact have you all seen from that yet, and could you maybe quantify what Texas in that part of the world means for the Paint Stores Group?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, it's impacted our business as we've had stores and customers impacted naturally. Texas is a good part of our business. We've a good representation there and good distribution of stores. I don't know right now what the \u2013 how to quantify that for the years. There will be some slowdown in the near term, and then there will be a pick up on the other side as repairs are done. So it's hard to say in a year how that will impact us. Obviously, in the very short-term when you have stores closed, Jay, the obvious that those stores being closed will impact it, but on the other side, we'll pick up some business as repairs are done.", "Jay McCanless - Sterne Agee", "Got it. Okay. Great. Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Jay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Thanks. A couple of questions. I just \u2013 if you could update us on your guidance for raw materials. If I remember how \u2013 at the beginning of the year, you thought for the full year, the industry will be down. Do you think that's still the case and have you changed at all as part of your updated guidance? And then I have a follow-up.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Greg, this is Bob. We have not changed our outlook for raw materials. As a reminder, to put a little finer point on it, we expected raw materials for the full year to be down low mid-single-digits. So below \u2013 less than 5%, but in the mid-single-digit range. That's for the full year. And 1Q was at the high end of the mid-single-digit range, because we're annualizing full year declines from 2015. So, actually most of the savings year-over-year are already locked in based on the history that we're going up against last year. We think the price of many of the raw materials that we've used have stabilized, but the benefit \u2013 and so the benefit will diminish as we go through the year, but the benefit is already locked.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "Got it. And then the \u2013 I guess two other questions, one on Global Finishes, and a little bit of housekeeping. Remind me how you do leap day? Is that in the comp, not in the comp, is it in the total sales? And then Global Finishes, I know you took some great cost out there, but how much longer can sales not grow and profits grow?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think, first of all, you know the comp stores are the Paint Stores Group that we don't report any type of comp metric for the Global Finishes Group. I think that again we feel very good about, operationally, what we're doing there. I think that what helps there, and I think it goes back to John's comments, we've \u2013 if you compare it to the Latin America group, our volume has been good. When you look at the total, the volume has been good, and so when we get volume, we get the opportunity to basically increase that margin. So, I would say it's not going to be \u2013 we definitely and we've talked about over the years, we need some more market share in the Global Finishes Group to really get it kicked and going, but because of the volume gains, they've been able to get margin improvement.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "And so basically FX took sales down a little bit, but you had some sales growth, and that was enough to get that nice margin expansion?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes. Yes.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And just to be clear, was there an extra day in the quarter because of May or February 29?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "When you put everything together, the February 29, was there, but we also had Easter and we \u2013 going back there was an extra day, but Good Friday, just because of the way things are, never, never that week is Friday is never the same as a normal Friday. So moving that Good Friday into the first quarter here is why I answered the question earlier. Yeah, we got a day, but it just felt like it was negated by the Easter move.", "Gregory S. Melich - Evercore ISI", "I got it. Thanks a lot. Great job.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. I had a longer-term question. The Valspar SEC filing indicated that there was a second company that whoever acquired Valspar might also be interested in acquiring the other company as well, but it indicated Sherwin-Williams wouldn't be able to acquire the other company. Would that simply be size or do you think maybe after you pay down some debt from the Valspar deal, you might have an opportunity to do another significant transaction?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think \u2013 first, we don't know who that company was and that's not something that we would want to comment on without having that information, John.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. I was fishing, obviously, but since it's out there, I apologize, I'll give it a try...", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks for your honesty.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Thank you. Good quarter, guys.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, John.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Jessie. Let me close with two items. The first being, we're frequently asked actual diluted share count outstanding on December 31 \u2013 on March 31, it was $92,495,113 for those of you who are still on the line. The second item is a reminder that our annual financial community presentation is scheduled for Thursday, May 26, it's at our headquarters in Cleveland. The program will consist of our customary morning presentation with a question-and-answer session, followed by a reception and lunch with company management.", "Then in the afternoon, we're going to head down to our Breen Technology Center, which is home to Sherwin-Williams' global architectural paint research and development, where we'll have a showcase for many of our latest technologies in both architectural and industrial products.

After the company's prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Jesse. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, July 21 Press Release. I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the second quarter 2016 compared to the second quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment.", "Consolidated net sales increased 2.8% to a record $3.22 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 1.5% in the quarter. Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $105.8 million in the quarter to $1.64 billion.", "Our consolidated gross margin increased 200 basis points in the quarter to 50.8% of sales from 48.8% in the second quarter last year. More than half of the gross margin improvement in the quarter resulted from the positive mix effect of Paint Stores Group, our highest gross margin segment, outpacing the growth of the other segments, coupled with increased operating leverage from higher production and distribution volume.", "Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $54.7 million over second quarter last year to $1.1 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.7% in the second quarter this year, from 31.9% last year. A relatively small portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.", "Interest expense increased $28 million compared to second quarter last year to $40.9 million. This increase includes $20.7 million in acquisition-related interest expense with the balance resulting from a shift to long-term debt from short-term that occurred mid-year 2015.", "Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $31.4 million to $539.2 million, due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $3.3 million compared to second quarter last year.", "Our effective tax rate in the second quarter was 32.1%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard. For the full-year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in the low 30%s, excluding the impact of the change in accounting standard.", "Consolidated net income increased $28.1 million to $378.1 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 11.7% compared to 11.2% in the second quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 7.8% to $3.99 per share from $3.70 per share in 2015. The $3.99 includes $0.09 accretion from the accounting change and $0.16 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the second quarter 2016 increased 6.2% to $2.11 billion from $1.98 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. All of the Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher organic architectural paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter and Protective & Marine coating sales were a modest drag on revenue growth.", "Regionally in the second quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Canada and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every geographic division.", "Segment profit for the group increased $75.6 million, or 17.4% to $509 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin increased to 24.1% of sales from 21.8% in the second quarter last year.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, second quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars decreased 11.2% to $133.3 million, due to unfavorable currency translation and negative volumes that were partially offset by selling price increases. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 16.4% in the quarter.", "Segment profit in U.S. dollars decreased to a loss of $9.6 million in the quarter from a profit of $4 million last year. Segment profit was negatively impacted by higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were partially offset by selling price increases.", "Currency translation decreased Latin America segment profit $1.3 million in the quarter. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 7.2% in the quarter compared to a profit of 2.7% in the second quarter 2015.", "Turning to the Consumer Group, second quarter sales decreased 2.6% to $477.5 million. As a reminder, in April, we annualized the completion of the load-in of the HGTV HOME by Sherwin-Williams paint program in Lowe's stores, which was completed by May 1 last year.", "Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $6 million to $108.3 million in the quarter from $114.2 million in the second quarter last year, due primarily to lower sales and increased SG&A spending, partially offset by improved operating efficiencies. Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 22.7% from 23.3% in the same period last year.", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased 1.3% to $499.2 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment 2.6% in the quarter.", "Second quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $8 million, or 13.9% to $65.2 million, due primarily to decreasing raw material costs and good cost control, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation, which decreased segment profit $1.5 million in the quarter. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the same period last year.", "That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So, I will now turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for third quarter and full-year. John?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I think it's fair to say our results for the second quarter were mixed. Architectural paint volumes through our Paint Stores Group held up well in the quarter, resulting in solid revenue growth and continued strong earnings leverage and flow-through.", "Our Global Finishes Group also did a commendable job of managing both gross margins and SG&A, resulting in a respectable 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest volume growth.", "We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and the U.S., and currency headwinds in Latin America are starting to ease. Those were the positives in the quarter.", "On the other hand, while we expected difficult comparisons in the HGTV HOME paint program due to heavy stocking orders in the second quarter last year, some of the retail programs we thought would generate growth in the quarter fell short. We are supporting many of these programs with incremental SG&A investment and we have high return expectations on these investments. Finally, while currency comparisons have improved in many Latin American countries, demand trends remain difficult and our outlook for this segment for the full-year continues to deteriorate.", "Our earnings per share results in the quarter include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition as well as a tax benefit related to the adoption of a new accounting standard. If you back out these items, diluted net income per common share increased 9.7% on sales growth of less than 3%. As a percent of sales, gross profit increased 200 basis points year-over-year and operating profit and profit before tax, both expanded a little more than 50 basis points.", "Excluding the acquisition expense, our incremental margin on consolidated profit before tax was 36%. SG&A was the only line on the P&L that went the wrong way as a percent of sales. The result of higher SG&A spending by Paint Stores Group, channel investment by Consumer Group and expenses related to the Valspar acquisition.", "Paint Stores Group delivered another strong sales performance in the residential segments, which includes residential repaint contractors, new residential construction and DIY. Combined, sales to these three segments grew by more than 10%. Sales to commercial, healthcare and property management customers also generated solid year-over-year growth. The outlook for continued growth in these segments over the balance of the year remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends reported by most of our contractor segments, extending into 2017.", "During the first half of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 45 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations. This completes our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the full-year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations. Today, our total store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,117 compared to 4,025 a year ago.", "We anticipated a modest sales decline from Consumer Group coming into the second quarter. This, combined with the elevated SG&A investment tempered our second quarter outlook which is reflected in our guidance. We remain confident that the great work our Consumer Group teams are doing in strengthening our brand positioning across all retail channels and the investment we are making in many of these channels will pay handsome returns in the years ahead. Consumer Group's commercial, industrial and MRO business continue to show good progress on both sales and margin in the quarter.", "Unfavorable currency translation continues to weigh on sales and profit performance in our Global Finishes Group and Latin America Coatings Group. Both segments reported positive sales in local currency in the quarter and Global Finishes Group volumes were positive, thanks in large part to improving market conditions in North America and Europe.", "Volume sales in most Latin American countries continue to decline with Brazil standing out as the most notable exception. Although Brazil's volume momentum improved in the quarter, margin pressure from raw materials continue to challenge profitability in Brazil and throughout the region. In the first six months of 2016, we generated $510 million in net operating cash, an increase of $161 million compared to the first half of 2015, driven by higher six-month net income and good working capital discipline.", "Working capital was a use of cash in the quarter, increasing by about $3.8 million year-over-year. Working capital as a percent of sales decreased to 11.6% from 11.8% at the end of the second quarter last year. Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $62.1 million. Depreciation was $43.8 million and amortization was $6.2 million.", "In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovation projects.", "During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury. On June 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016.", "At the close of the second quarter 2016, our cash balance was $402.7 million compared to $75.1 million on June 30, 2015. Yesterday, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.", "The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the next six months remains very positive, and we should see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset, to some degree, by continued weakness in Latin America. As we've commented over the past few quarters, the gross margin tailwind we have enjoyed in recent years from raw material cost deflation will diminish, as we go through the back-half of 2016.", "Our outlook for third quarter 2016 is for consolidated net sales to increase low to mid-single digits percent compared to last year's third quarter. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.10 to $4.30 per share compared to last year's record $3.97 per share.", "The full-year 2016 earnings per share guidance we provided at the end of the first quarter did not include expenses related to the acquisition of Valspar or the tax benefit from the adoption of the new accounting standard. Today, we are revising our guidance for full-year consolidated net income per common share to reflect these two impacts.", "For the full-year, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2015 by a low-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are revising our expectations for full-year diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.65 to $11.85 per share compared to $11.16 per share earned in 2015.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And, now, we'd be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we would be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Perfect. Thank you very much. Could you just comment on your performance in the DIY channel specifically at the home centers? And how HGTV trended versus Infinity inventories? And then also whether or not you believe there is a large inventory \u2013 or excuse me, a pull forward from March as well? Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think that there was a large pull forward in the first quarter. I'd say that our performance in the second quarter, we feel as though inside our largest customer with Lowe's that we're continuing to gain momentum as far as the performance in the market, I think we're going to let them comment on how their performance rated against the market.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Perfect. And just a quick follow-up. You outlined a few trends in LatAm and indicated you still expect some continued weakness. But can you offer a little more color on what you're seeing here and whether or not you believe you've reached an inflection point in terms of the magnitude of operating losses? Thank you.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, I think that last year we earned positive profit in each one of the quarters last year. And for the year, we think that this year is going to be the exact opposite. But I do think when you look at the investments we're making, we think we're doing the right long-term and we think that the markets are troughing.", "I think that when you look at specifically at Mexico and Brazil, we're closer to the end. What we said last year, we felt that Brazil, you wouldn't see an improvement during 2016, maybe mid-2017. I don't think we've seen much difference there with political and so forth.", "In Mexico, we think Mexico is doing better. We think that's doing fine, but Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, we're still having some headwinds there and so we do believe that for the year we're going to lose money in Latin America.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But as we've spoken in the past, we feel this is an opportunity for us. We see rather than just waiting for the market to correct, and we do think that the market will improve, that there are some steps that we can be taking and we're taking those steps, and ensuring that we've got the right products, the right channels and the right people in those markets and we're making very good progress in the improvements down there. So, as the market does improve, we expect to outperform the market.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "That's great detail. Thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning. First off on the 5.2% same store sales increase that you reported during the quarter, did that come in basically where you thought it would come \u2013 where you thought it would heading into the quarter? And in terms of the outlook, do you sense any change in industry fundamentals either in residential or commercial construction, or any particular region within the U.S.? Thanks.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "This is Sean Hennessy. And the 5.2% is fairly close to where we were. We have said that in the first quarter that was tremendously strong. We're almost double digits in the comp store, so we did feel that it was going to be lower than that first quarter, but the 5.2% in that materially different than what we had in the guidance.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And regarding the market, Ghansham, I'd say it's been great deal of my time with our customers and with our people in this segment, and there's a strong sense of bullishness in this area. There's continued growth in the residential repaint area. This is yet another quarter for us with double-digit gains in residential repaint. Our commercial customers are really speaking of a very solid book that currently exists, as well as a number of bids in the pipeline. So, on the architectural side, we're really excited about this market.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And just my second question, in terms of the \u2013 maybe you can share the raw material costs including titanium dioxide and inflation more broadly including labor inflation from the back half of 2016 and heading into 2017. I guess I'm asking because the industry has not seen a paint price increase since 2013, it seems like the case is increasing for one in 2017, would you sort of agree with that?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yes, Ghansham, this is Bob. On the raw material outlook, we still see low mid-single-digit deflation for the full-year 2016. Although, you asked specifically about TiO2. The majors in TiO2 we think are probably gaining some traction on the second quarter price increase that they announced, that is off to December 2015 lows.", "The implementation at this point as near as we can tell from an industry standpoint is probably in the mid-single-digit cents per pound, so not a significant increase in percentage terms. As expected, they've been out with a third quarter announcement. We think that it's likely they may get some traction, but how much they get really depends on customer size, on location geographically.", "So, we're likely to see some year-over-year inflation in TiO2 as far as the rest as the basket. The feed stocks for the latex and acrylic monomer market have been very stable. Chemical grade propylene has been steady at around $0.31 a pound. So we don't necessarily see inflation in that side of the basket.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And on the labor side, we're putting our game plans together for 2017. We've done a lot of work on 2017. But we don't see \u2013 in our guidance, we still see productivity gains, especially in the Stores Group. So, when you look at that labor expense \u2013 and we're evaluating 2017, as we go.", "And as always, before we announce in the market what we're going to do with pricing, we would talk to our customers first. So, those plans are being developed right now. And if we do go, after we've talked to the customers, we'll be pretty transparent and let you know.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Ghansham.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. When you look across the paint industry in United States and you compare the performance of company-owned stores, whether it's yours or those of other companies, to the amount of paint that's going through the big box retailers or through channels that are non-company-owned stores, do you see differences in volume growth or are they comparable?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think, when you look at the results, I think, it's showing up, Jeff, that the painting contractor is the faster growing \u2013 that the painting contractor is growing faster than DIY. I think that's our perception, and I think the facts bear that out.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And is there a different conduct of the big box retailers toward inventories; that is, are they taking steps to meaningfully push down their inventories either temporarily or permanently?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I think that our customers have always done a very good job in managing their working capital, and we're constantly working with them. We want to have the right inventory on the shelf, Jeff. And there are times when that means that they're little lighter in some areas and a little more in others.", "And so I'd say it's just an ongoing discussion that we have with our customers. We want to help drive their key metrics cumulatively or any others that they have. And so, as they are reviewing what it is that's working for them, we want to be a part of that.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, fellas. Question just on the raw materials again. For Global Finishes, you called out that raw materials was down and a benefit for LatAm that was up and a headwind, what's the dichotomy going on there?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that Latin America 100% of the raw materials are based on U.S. dollar and it's fully affected by the currency changes. In the Global Finishes, we do have a portion of that business that's in the United States that doesn't have that same effect and I think that's what \u2013 that's really the dramatic difference there.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. In the 2016 since you called out on the acquisition cost, what was that pre-tax and where did that roll through the P&L?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. 100% of it went through the admin section. It was $25.2 million pre-tax which we broke down to $15.4 million after-tax, which gave $0.16. $4.5 million approximately went through SG&A, the other $21 million went through the interest expense. And again, that was 100% in the administrative segment.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, fellas.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Duffy.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Morning, thanks. Just a question on the same stores, I think you do both Protective & Marine in there, so is that a fair assumption that your architectural sales were above that 5.2% and maybe you can just gauge what kind of range your Protective & Marine was tracking in the quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. Your first part of the question and sort of your implication is exactly right. Architectural was the fastest growing and the Protective & Marine was dampened. Really don't have a metric that I think we can share with you that we'd be comfortable with.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "But I would say this, Arun, is that, all along as we've been going through this, just as we just talked about Latin America, there are a number of segments within the Protective & Marine opportunities for our company. And so while we've been experiencing some pressure in oil and gas, the teams are pivoting and really focused on other segments that offer opportunities in both sales and margin.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And just similarly on those points, though, would you say that both in Latin America and in Protective & Marine you're nearing kind of a bottom in those comps and is your guidance kind of embed and using in those comps through the year?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think so. Yeah, I think as we move forward, the comps \u2013 we're going to lap those comps. And at the same time, some of the good work our teams \u2013 what they're putting in place right now will continue to, I think positively benefit us going forward.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I think that even though the comps are getting easier, we're basically saying I think that we're in a trough now. I don't think we're ready to say that we're going to see some major growth in either the Latin America or the Protective & Marine, but I think we're in a trough.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "In the oil and gas.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And then, just last question, you had put out earlier that your belief is that you can potentially get to 820 million gallons in the next peak, is that still your belief and when do you think you can get there in that cycle? Thanks.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "It is, Arun. And we base that belief on the fact that the install base of square footage that requires maintenance has grown pretty dramatically since we considered mid-700 million gallons to be normalized. So this peak should be well above the last peak just at normal build rates and we're not back to normal build rates yet. We consider normal to be closer to 1.4 million, 1.5 million residential starts and a little stronger non-res activity than we're seeing right now.", "So, once we get build rates back there and once the maintenance cycles have returned to kind of normalized repaint activity, we think we're going to see normalized volume in the 780 million to 810 million gallons and very likely that this cycle should peak above that 810 million gallons. Whether that takes three years or five years to get back to, time will tell, as the rate of recovery in the residential market right now, I think, that is probably going to take at least three years to get back there.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right. Thanks.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Good morning. So, I just wanted to \u2013 a little longer-term oriented question, just trying to understand, your gross margin obviously up nice in the quarter and gross margins been coming up quite a bit. Obviously, raw material cost has something to do with that. But as you guys look at kind of like your normalized gross margins, what are your thoughts about that? Can we still see things come up here and \u2013 I just wanted to get your thoughts on that?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think that the way we run the business, we believe that in the long-term, we're going to continue to raise the ROS. I think that the gross margin, we've had great expansion. And basically because of three things \u2013 really nice gallon growth especially in the Stores Group, an integration that is complete now from the Comex North America, and raw materials have been a tailwind but those things have occurred.", "I think that in all cases, we're always looking long-term. I like your term \u2013 really looking in the long-term. And again this year, we're taking a balanced approach to where we're going. We're investing. There is times when the gross margin will lead our ROS improvements. And there is times that SG&A \u2013 and in fact that gallon growth that we've had in the Stores Group is because of innovation. I think that we continue to do a lot of innovation, and innovation has helped us in all the different segments.", "So when you look at where we're going this year, our mid-point of our range is $12.60; last year was $11.13 \u2013 a 13% increase \u2013 and then when you take a look at a challenging global environment and no share buybacks. Our original guidance had approximately $0.25 worth of buybacks in there.", "So, we're generating net operating cash at record levels, and we're continuing to make prudent investments in the business. So, you're going to see SG&A probably this year isn't going to be in the improvement in the ROS, it has to be in gross margin. And we had the tailwind. We've clearly said there wasn't going to be a tailwind. We had the innovation. We had Stores Group going away. But we're pretty confident that those investments will earn solid returns in the future, and that's how we do this balanced approach for the long-term that you asked.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "That's perfect. I appreciate all the color. And just maybe switching gears just a little bit to capacity levels that you guys are seeing right now, one of these \u2013 where are they and what will they look like if you successfully close the Valspar acquisition?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We always have said that we were \u2013 88% to 92% is the sweet spot for us. And 2008 and 2009, when the market did go down 25%, 30% in that one year, we managed it. We did not take all the capacity out to get down to that level. And that's where the earlier question about the 820 million gallons, we were shooting for that 750 million gallons, 770 million gallons. So that capacity \u2013 we live with the capacity in the low 70%. We're now much closer to that 88% to 92%, and that's why our margins are doing very well.", "Since then, that North America acquisition of Comex \u2013 I think those gallons going into our footprint, but we've hung onto a couple of the assets they have and when we look at the Valspar, we think that they have some great assets to give us for capacity. We think that gives us another leg in the stool that give us the ability to have that capacity utilization go down in the short-term, but then gives us the ability to grow without a great deal of CapEx.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "All right, awesome. Thanks guys. Appreciate it.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much. Just to dig in a little bit more in Consumer Group, you mentioned a couple of programs you were running at retail that didn't get the traction that you were looking for and you obviously have some increased spending against that. So, what is just sort broadly or specifically, what's the course correction that you're looking to do and is it something that you can do this year or is it something that we have to wait until next paint season to see the results of?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think what's important here is that there is some investment here and we see as the clear opportunity. We do go into this with our eyes wide open. We know that there are investments made that may not come back in the first quarter that we make those investments, maybe not the second. But if you look at our market share in this segment, there's terrific opportunities, we believe a disciplined approach and aggressive approach here can help us to grow our market share and manage our margins for our shareholders. So, we're moving in this direction with a very disciplined look. We're making the investments and we think that there are opportunities out there for us to grow.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "And...", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And just as a \u2013 go ahead, sorry, Bob.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yeah and as far as the timing as you mentioned, we're patient. We think \u2013 but we don't see it snapping back in the next quarter or so.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay and just as a follow-up, you mentioned Consumer Group should improve sequentially through the balance of the year; but, I mean, should we be modeling 3Q still flat to down, or how should we be thinking about that on the top-line?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "You know on the top-line, I think, as we settle sequentially, we'll improve I think that; but, you know, with some of the situations we just talked about, we think it's going to be flat to up slightly.", "Vincent Stephen Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Vincent.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yes, thank you. Question first just on your overall impression in the architectural market, you know, last year was obviously \u2013 I know, you don't like to talk about weather, but it was weather depressed and growth was 2% to 3%, are you seeing the snapback you expected this year or has that been moderated again by weather? Bob, what's kind of your outlook for the U.S. architectural market growth this year?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yeah, Don. For starters, we don't think there was much of a weather effect in the numbers this year. We think that build rates are holding up very well, but they're not on fire. Residential construction is up about 10% year-over-year in square footage terms.", "In the commercial markets, starts are down but completions are up pretty significantly year-over-year. So we're seeing solid demand growth in the new construction market. In the repaint market, while the pro-residential repaint business has been really solid, what's hard to determine at this stage, because we just don't have the data is how the DIY channels held up in the second quarter. So, I hesitate to say, that there's just not enough data to call market growth in the second quarter yet, but I think that's the truth. The contractor market seems to have grown nicely, but it's hard to tell on the other piece.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. And, John, a question, maybe you can update us on Valspar synergy outlook, to the extent you've been able to talk to your counterparts over there and have meetings about combining the two companies. What's your updated outlook for synergy potential or as \u2013 what's your updated confidence level in the original target you set out?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. I don't think we're going to move the original target and \u2013 but I think that as time goes on, we continue to feel very confident that we're going to hit those numbers.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Don.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hi, good morning.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Mike.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "I was wondering if you could give a little more detail on the solid margin performance you had in the Global Finishes Group? I know you mentioned the price and mix was improving. What exactly was driving that and how sustainable could a number like 13% margin be as we get into the second half in that segment?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "I think that when we take a look at that group I think that the improvement stems from really four focused driving that product technology I mentioned earlier into the market, improving SG&A, capturing pricing in the \u2013 where to offset currency and then capturing reductions in the raw materials that they occur in the United States.", "So, these combination of four things I don't think are going to change. You'll see the slide. For the longest time, we used to talk about 12% and I think that this has given us great confidence that we can say 13%. And with some market share gains, I think, we can actually beat that number. So, I think the game plan has worked very, very well.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "All right. Great. And then a question on Latin America. You'd sounded like you mentioned that you expect to be below breakeven for the rest of the year. But just wondering, as we get into the heavier paint season there in Q4, is there a chance that we get north of breakeven? And also wondering if there was some unusual costs in Q2 that help explain a pretty significant sequential weakening in terms of the earnings in Latin America? Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "The answer to the last question is, no, there really was no one-time thing that I would point out. I just think it was the operation as it is. I think we come closer to breakeven and maybe there is a chance that if we have a little stronger sales \u2013 the fourth quarter definitely is the closest to breakeven for the remainder of the year. But right now, I would not come out here and say we're definitely going to make money in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Thanks. Two questions. One was accounting and charge clarification and then second on the business. Sean, the income tax benefit \u2013 could you explain what that actually is? And is it just simply as straight as $0.09, $8 million is coming into taxes?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes. And what that is, is when we've expensed \u2013 when starting the new rules many, many years ago, expensing stock option, RSO grant and so forth, you charge the P&L for the Black Scholes amount. So, whatever the Black Scholes value was on the day of the issuance, basically, you straight line to a three-year or a five-year option vesting period.", "Then what would occur is, if the stock \u2013 the differential between when the day of vesting, a differential between the Black Scholes value and the actual value was actually that difference would use to go to retained earnings. We always took it on our tax return, and that was one of the differentials between book and cash taxes.", "So this change, this accounting change for us has nothing to do with and won't change our cash performance; but instead of having that differential for us as you said in the second quarter, $8 million go to retained earnings and now goes directly through the P&L. So that's why it was $0.09 in the second quarter. Year-to-date, it was $0.28 and the reason why it was $0.19 in the first quarter is because of the \u2013 in the first quarter when the vesting occurred of our long-term RSOs, so that many people around that, so that's why it hit in the first quarter, second quarter was really driven by stock options that were exercised. So, that's what it is. It does have a cash differential that's why we pointed it out. We adopted it this quarter, so we can do it the accounting this way. I think as time goes on, I think January everyone has to go on it, so I think what we took the opportunity to do it now just to get this noise out of our P&L next year.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "And so we should see something else in the next two quarters?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "More like the second quarter not the first quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right. And just so you know when we try to say, we guesstimated that number will be $0.45 for the year. So, when we were talking about when we show that schedule in the back, that's where that $0.45 comes from. So 2017, we're seeing 2017 in the next two quarters, so $0.085 a quarter or something in that range.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Thank you. That's a great catch up. So, then back to the more fun stuff, John, I guess, what will be helpful is understanding through the quarter I think there were a couple questions that sort of tease it out, if I remember last year we had a wet June and that may have had some impact, would you say that the business was quite steady in Paint Stores Group through the quarter or was there strengthening or weakening or how would you put that together?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd say, it was pretty steady if you compare apples-to-apples, Greg, the performance inside stores still go in the right direction but consistent throughout the quarter.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Got it. And I think in the prepared comments you mentioned that in Consumer, what was weaker than expected was other retail programs. I think I got \u2013 I hope I wrote that down right. Explain to us what that is, is that other architectural paint programs or is it some of the spray paints or sealants or give us a little more color on that would be helpful?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Those are few things that we're working on, Greg and quite frankly, we prefer that our customers start talking about that when the timing is right. We're leaning forward in that area. And as I mentioned and it is important in a very disciplined fashion. We didn't feel as though that the return would come back in the first quarter.", "Sales-wise, we have high expectations for ourselves and we're going to continue to push to grow our sales. We have a high regard for our team there and they're pursuing some opportunities with customers in a number of different channels and in a number of different segments and spaces. So, it's not one but a number of areas that we are investing in and believe that we can grow.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "But it specifically wasn't the HGTV that cycling the sale in last year, that was on plan?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's correct.", "Greg Melich - Evercore ISI", "All right. Thanks. Good luck.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Yeah. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. First is on non-res starts, as Bob, I think you said completions have been good this year so that's obviously helping your business. But starts themselves have been down meaningfully in the first part of this year. Does that mean that there's going to be a fairly significant headwind next year and what you do to sort of get ahead of that?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yeah, Nils, on average, as we typically point out, the time between starts and completion runs about 20 months to 22 months in the non-residential space, which means that next year we're primarily going to be completing 2015 starts. 2015 was a pretty strong year. Not as strong as 2014. 2014 was the strongest year since the recession.", "2015 was the second strongest and today so far year-to-date we're running down about 9% in square footage of starts. So, we will see the non-residential market trend downward in terms of completions over the next couple of years. As a reminder, the non-res market you're talking about, a-third of the new construction piece of the market, which new construction totals less than 20%. So it will be a headwind in out years just not a real significant one.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Got it. And then, at your recent Investor Day, you guys highlighted quite a bit of the innovation particularly Paint Shield, wondering how that's tracking and obviously there's back \u2013 tying into the non-res starts, there has been some quite a bit of strength in healthcare. So, wondering if you've been able to get in on the ground, so to speak.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I'd say, with the new technology like this, as expected in this area that there will be a little bit of a ramp-up. We're working with a number of different decision makers and influencers in this area. Trend-wise, it's going in the right direction. And we're going to continue to focus on it. But the comparisons, as we go forward here, while we expect to continue to improve.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Understood. I'll pass it on.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Nils.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, can you give me the gross profit changes on the Paint Stores, Consumer and Global and Latin America? Give a chance.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. Paint Stores Group was an increase of $116 million. Consumer was flat. Global Finishes was up $2.5 million, and Latin America was down $13 million.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then in terms of the Paint Stores, the significant contribution margin has been pretty largely probably due to the volume leverage and outflow of raw materials. Does raw material sort of level out? Do you look for that contribution margin to sort of go back to the traditional 25%, 30% type of flow through to the bottom line, as you go through the back-half?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think the 60%, 70% flow through are nice. But you're right. Not just that raw materials grew, we're fully integrated now with Comex. And those things have really helped us over the last two years, three years. So, yeah, we see as time goes on, we still have great flow through. But probably you're going to see it closer to maybe a little higher than what we've done in the past. But yes, it will.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then the last question. In terms of the acquisition-related costs, how much of \u2013 what are the big buckets that these costs are going into and how much of them are cash? And are they big enough where you're sort of getting ahead of what cost may be when the deal finally closes in the first quarter?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. In the first quarter, the acquisition cost \u2013 I'm going to just speak to PBT. I won't talk about it unless you want me to. But if you take a look at the big buckets, there were advisor fees there. And then another big piece of that niche, that's the cash-out in the third quarter because of the timing and so forth, but that plus the bridge and turmoil fees, we're amortizing those bridge and turmoil fees today, that's cash.", "Then we have some legal fees that are cash, but the big hit will be Valspar's advisor and legal fees, which will occur at the close. So, when we look at that $0.72 that we show in the fourth quarter to finalize the 132, the majority of that is going to be a cash hit that's why a lot of times we look at the cash needed to close this $11.3 billion, we look at it closer to $11.5 billion because we have these $200 million worth of pre-tax closing costs in total. The majority of which will be paid back at that time.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Ivan.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good morning, everyone.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Most of my stuff has been covered already, but I want to go back to the Consumer segment. Just focusing on the segment rather than the customer, John, Sean and Bob, how would the sales change year-over-year look if you could take out the load in sales of a year ago?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It would be up slightly.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "So, 2%, 3% is that a good way to put it slightly?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right. Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Chuck.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Hi. Good morning. Question for Sean, when you're referring to SG&A been elevated for the balance of the year, the 70 basis points of deleverage that we saw in 2Q, is that the run rate we should consider for the back half of the year?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think you're not going to be far off, it's not going to be exactly that, but that's probably not a bad number.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "And then when we think about the 70 basis points in 2Q, is that all Consumer or are there investments elsewhere that cause deleverage?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think the majority of which was in Consumer, but LACG \u2013 but we're still investing in stores. I think that the stores investments have not changed. We think this is a continued driver. So, the SG&A increase as a percent of sales was not in stores, but we still are investing in the stores as heavy as we ever have been.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Right. So just a tailored question, maybe the consumer \u2013 given that you had heavy investment last year and then you have heavy investment this year that might be related to other programs. Do you think this is needed to sustain that flat to low single-digit growth you guys have guided to longer-term? Or should we expect the growth rate to be better than that once you get a return on these investments?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're going to be trying to drive that higher, Scott. Investments that we're making here we believe can help us.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Hello and good morning, everyone.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "I guess it is still morning. I was just wondering if on the Global Finishes Group you could talk a little bit about the areas where you are seeing some improvement outside of oil and gas, which markets or which industries are actually growing?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Inside our Protective & Marine we're focused on a number of them. Rosemarie, I prefer not to highlight those for obvious reasons, but our teams are really pivoting into some areas where we've had some presence in the past, but we feel as though we could be more meaningful in the marketplace. And so we're investing in sales rep time and specification effort as well as some product development to help us.", "So, as we're pursuing these segments we're \u2013 sometimes adversity brings out the best. We're finding that we have technologies that will help customers in adjacent segments. We have people that are knowledgeable and we can pursue better. So, we're after them. I'd rather not highlight them right now, but rest assured that we're out there and pursuing them.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "So when we look at the industrial world or the industrial market what you are seeing is, I am just making sure I understand, is that you don't want to talk about those particular areas which are actually doing better than what we read in the paper, for example?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's correct. And in some of the areas that we just have a lower share in the very profitable segments that we can increase our share in.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And for Sean, if I look at that \u2013 the impact on the interest expense from the acquisition expenses. So, I am actually calculating that your regular interest expense is $20.2 million more or less. Is that the right number to look at for the balance of the year, until you are actually borrowing the full boat for the Valspar acquisition?", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes it is. We did borrow last year in July. And so, we've now fully anniversaried those bonds that we issued. So, we're 100% fixed right now because we're not in any variable interest. That's a very good rate. That $20 million is a very good number.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. And then lastly, if I may, and you may not want to respond to it, but anything new on the regulatory front regarding the Valspar acquisition.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I wouldn't say that there is anything new. We disclosed that we've received a second request, and we're working with the FTC to provide all the information that they need to complete their review. So, we're trying to be as responsive as we can to provide them with the information that they're asking for.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "And with that in mind, do you still expect to close at the end of the first quarter?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We still are anticipating closing in the first quarter, yes.", "Rosemarie Jeanne Morbelli - Gabelli & Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Rosemarie. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. Thanks, guys. Housing may not be at a peak again yet, but Cleveland certainly seems to be on a high right now.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Wait till October and the Indians in the World Series.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "There is a lot of questions on the call here about the sustainability of paint demand at these levels. On your pro customers, do you have insights into their backlogs? When you talk about them being bullish, do you think their backlogs or business are higher or just because there has been such a strong first half, they probably run off a fair amount of backlog that it would be hard for them to maintain the same level?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Actually, John, the discussions I've had with many customers around the country would say that they've got a good book of business that they're dealing with right now. They've got a good book of business that they have in the pipeline either secured or believe that they're going to secure. But what gives us, perhaps, most excitement is the pipeline of bids that they're looking at down the road. They also feel \u2013 that's why I mentioned earlier that they are bullish about those as well.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "All right. Are they buying spray equipment and ladders that would be supportive that they have a lot of confidence in their outlook?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "They are, yes. I'm going to say that we have strong equipment sales, as we pointed out in the first portion of our discussion.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yep. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hello, everyone. This is Chris Evans on for Bob. Just in your 2016 guidance I was hoping you could give me a little more directionality or specificity on your same store sales number that you're implying?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think that we've never broken out segment win inside our guidance but I think what we freely have said for probably 14 quarters in a row when you look at that guidance number, the Stores Group again will [lead our] sales in the third quarter and fourth quarter and for the full-year. So I think that the first half of the year is probably a pretty good indication of where you'd see, when you break out your sales in the model that Stores Group is going to be number one and those comp stores are going to be strong.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks, John. And then another year you're expecting 90 to 110 net new stores, you put out some pretty good targets out there on 6,000. Can you just talk about sort of what gives you guys the confidence to say that you're not hitting or you won't hit a saturation point or some diminishing returns with that level of continued growth?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "I'd say we spend a lot of time on this metric. We've been watching to see how the new stores today are creating cash and the metrics versus the metrics we've done over the years. We compare it to the market. We compare it to how that market is in relative size to stores per household and the metrics have all been going in the right direction, which would tell you if your incremental stores continue to perform like that, you're probably \u2013 and the markets are performing that you're probably not at a saturation point.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Chris, we often cite that we're blessed with a number of very good competitors and there's plenty of opportunity out there for us to continue to grow and new stores is one channel for them.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. And then just one more really quick one with share repurchase side lines, decent amount of dilution in the quarter just kind of wondering, is that a reasonable run rate to expect as we go through the year or is that kind of unique to this quarter?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I think it's pretty reasonable. I think when we look at what we think our share count will be in the fourth quarter because of that dilution it's slightly higher than in the second quarter. But I think your point is well taken, again, approximately $0.25 of our original guidance we came out of January with had share repurchase. So when you look at the share count if you go out to the fourth quarter and have a slightly higher number than the second quarter, I think you're in good shape.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks guys.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "John, I wanted to circle back, you had talked about steady sales kind of month-to-month in the quarter, and hearing pretty good things from the customers, the painters from the channel in terms of what's going on. Curious how we look at the comp of 9% in the first quarter and 5% in the second quarter and look at the guidance it implies, the 2Q comp is the right number through the rest of the year, something in that neighborhood, what's the difference between 1Q and 2Q?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, the size of the number, obviously, when you look at the first quarter just the raw number versus the second has an impact on it, Eric and what I was speaking to as far as the comparisons month-to-month, we didn't see any significant highs and lows within the quarter that they were pretty consistent in our year-over-year comparisons.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. And so the \u2013 and I understand the scale and the magnitude of the quarters can make \u2013 can sort of hide the impact or overstate a little bit the impact of growth, were there pieces of the business that just grew faster in 1Q than they grew in 2Q?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, not that I can think of. We have, again not to be too repetitive here, but we had a terrific quarter and then in residential repaint, double-digit gains. As talked about in the first portion of our comments about the whole residential, new residential DIY, all performing well and I don't know that there was any significant swings from the first quarter to second quarter.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. I'll circle back to get more detail. All right. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Eric.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just had two. First is, wanted to get a little bit more understanding on the margins. So overall incremental margins are around 36% with Paint Stores performing particularly well. Are we close to the sweet spot in your capacity utilization and if so, is there much operating leverage remaining as we ramp up to what your estimate for mid-cycle paint volumes would be, or is this going to be more of a headwind going forward where we wouldn't see as much incremental margin for new paint volumes?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yeah, I think that we're getting closer to the sweet spot. I think that there is still some room when it comes to looking at that incremental margin. I think, when we were in the low-70%s, we had a great deal of room, and so you saw a greater impact. But I do think the incremental margins will still be strong. They will be higher than our ROS today.", "And I think that's the key for us. We are always trying to make sure that our incremental margin \u2013 our incremental flow-through, as we call it, is greater than our current ROS. So I still see that happening. I just don't see it happening at the 60%, 70% incremental margins.", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We've got a terrific operating team that's constantly working to improve and unlock capacity in our facilities. And so that process continues. And we've got a wonderful team there that's working diligently to do that on a regular basis.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "So, currently we're not at the 80%, 90% or so utilization?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's true.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Great. And then a second question on normalized paint volumes. I think your new forecast for 780 million gallons to 110 million gallons is a bit higher than your prior forecast. I think what we discussed a few years ago was normalized volumes of around 760 million. That's probably closer to what we are at today.", "And it looks like a large portion of the difference between your previous expectation and your new one is higher mid-cycle levels for res repaint and DIY. I know you guys discussed having a larger base of homes that would need repainting. But to the extent that the mid-cycle and new res forecast hasn't changed much, is it that we just expect the cycle to have a much bigger rally in the near-term before normalizing the mid-cycle or, I guess, what is driving the main difference?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Well, David, the question you're asking is why is what we consider normalized growing? And I think you answered the question. It's growing because the base is growing. And if you look at the overall U.S. architectural paint market, more than 80% of average annual volume goes toward repaint and it's applied to structures that already exist.", "If you look at that 740 million to 760 million normalized range that dates all the way back to the late 1990s. And we've had three building cycles since the late 1990s that have put a lot more square footage in place. Our population has grown significantly since then. So, we think it's reasonable to adjust the normalized expectation up based on primarily repaint volume.", "The other thing you see is, as the housing market continues to improve and get healthier and that health is oftentimes reflected in home values, you'll see the frequency of repaint activity increase. So at the peak of this cycle, people are painting more, just like they are remodeling more.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "All right. So, there will be no change to your estimates for, say, housing starts for the peak or normalized?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Well, no, for normalized that normalized band would assume housing starts in the range of 1.4 million to 1.5 million. We think that's sustainable given our current rate of household formation.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "All right. Great. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Lalli with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian J. Lalli - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, thanks for the time here late in the call, guys. I appreciate it. Just a quick question from the debt size and I apologize if I missed any prepared remarks in this but if could \u2013 could we get an update on the plans for, I guess, the longer term debt financing around the Valspar acquisition?", "And then, secondly, as a follow-up to that, Moody's specifically had comments on the ratings front being at risk for downgrade potentially even out of investment grade depending on the structure. So if you could maybe just comment on your commitment to IG rating and how that might guide your financing decisions as we get closer to closing, that would be helpful? Thanks a lot.", "Sean P. Hennessy - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "First of all, what we said and I don't have this in front of me, but I think I'm going to be very close. Bob can tell us on the financial community presentation that's now in the Sherwin.com under IR, so we have a schedule and I actually show you what we think our debt to EBITDA would be all the way out to I believe 2020.", "So, I'd ask you to do that but I think what we try to show there is that the day of close our leverage is going to go over 6% if we close, and based on closing first quarter 2017 our debt to EBITDA would be over 4%, approximately 4.25%, and so by 2019 we'll be at 3% and by 2020 at 1.9% which is under 2%. And I think that's a big goal by 2020 to be under 1.9%.", "What we said is, and I want to answer this way because immediately after that financial community presentation, we were asked, does this mean that you're not going to buy any stocks through 2020 and I said no, we are going to buy stock when our debt to EBIT starts to approach 2.5% to 1%. So that will give you a little picture of what we're thinking.", "And then on the Moody's front, I think that we read the same thing from Moody's. Every summer after the second quarter we've always had an individual meeting with Moody's and Fitch and S&P. We did have a meeting prior to the announcement of the Valspar acquisition, which is some \u2013 and I think that we're going to go see all three of the rating agencies during this quarter and it's been \u2013 we're optimistic that we keep the investment-grade.", "Investment-grade is very important to us because in the first quarter of every year our cash flow is negative, because we're building inventory for the season so we're in the commercial paper, we want to be in the A1/P1. We don't want to have one of them not be an investment-grade. We take a look at the metrics and we feel pretty good about the metrics long-term. And so, the investment-grade is pretty important to us.", "Brian J. Lalli - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for the response. I appreciate it.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Brian.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rich O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon now gentlemen.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Hi, Rich.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Hi. On the Protective & Marine business I thought in your opening comments you talked about that under the Paint Stores Group. Was I correct?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay. Is there also \u2013 there is also a Protective & Marine in the Global Finishes segment?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yes. That's correct, Richard. The Protective & Marine cuts across three segments. There's also some Protective & Marine business in Latin America.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay, fine. So is your comment that you made for under the Paint Stores Group a preferable to all three other segments, where the other segments, Protective & Marine being down?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Yeah. In terms of the impact of the current oil and gas pricing and the depression in mining activity, yes.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay, fine. Okay, thanks. Now, in the Paint Stores Group for Protective & Marine it's being sold by the local stores versus one of your major distributor centers is that the difference there?", "John G. Morikis - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's correct. We use the 4,000 plus stores as a point of distribution.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay, great. Second question is, I don't want to sound stupid about this, but in the Consumer Group, when you talk about making investments I'm not sure exactly what that means? If it means, your people in the stores, training the stores people, shelf space, can you elaborate a little bit on that?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "I think, number one, that's a partial list, but all three \u2013 all the things that you just mentioned plus different point of purchase materials, displays, maybe even thinning equipment, color matching equipment \u2013 all of that will go into that.", "Richard O'Reilly - Revere Associates", "Okay. So, that's what you mean by making the investments. Okay. Thank you, gentlemen.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks, Rich.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matthew Skowronski with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Matthew Stephen Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC", "Hey, guys. I'm Matt Skowronski on for Dmitry. Looking at Brazil and Latin America, Brazilian currency is kind of flat year-over-year. So, do you guys expect positive FX comps in the second half or are other currencies kind of going to weigh you down like the peso or the Argentinian peso?", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "No. Don't worry about the Argentinian peso. The four currencies that drive us \u2013 and I'm talking specifically Sherwin \u2013 are Brazilian reais, which is better than it was in the first quarter but still a headwind in the second quarter. We were still in the 3.11. We expect that possibly by the fourth quarter that's not going to be a headwind. That's going to be a tailwind.", "The second is Canadian dollar. The Canadian dollar has continued to be weak. So, we expect that's going to be a headwind for the remainder of the year. The euro, which is relatively flat, and so we think \u2013 but we have a big presence in the UK. And with the Ronseal brand, the [Lee's] paint brand, the Geocel and the Great Britain pound is now a headwind \u2013 a significant headwind.", "Matthew Stephen Skowronski - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Perfect. That's all the questions we have. Thank you so much.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Okay. Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Robert J. Wells - SVP-Communications & Public Affairs, IR Contact", "Thanks again, Jesse. As always, I would be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise out of this morning's call.

I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for the third quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2015, then comment on each reportable segment.", "Consolidated net sales increased $127.2 million or 4% to $3.28 billion, driven by higher paint sales volume in our Paint Stores Group and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.3% in the quarter. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales by 0.8% in the quarter.", "Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $61.7 million or 3.9% in the quarter to $1.64 billion compared to $1.57 billion last year. Consolidated gross margin was 49.9% of sales flat compared to the third quarter last year. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $64.5 million or 6.5% to $1.06 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A increased to 32.3% in the third quarter this year, up 80 basis points from last year. A portion of this increase was acquisition-related expenses.", "Interest expense increased $27.1 million compared to third quarter last year to $44.1 million. The vast majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $15.1 million or down 2.7% to $535.6 million, due primarily to acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax in the quarter by $4.6 million compared to third quarter last year.", "Consolidated net income increased $12.2 million or 3.3% to $386.7 million. Net income as a percent of sales was 11.8%, compared to 11.9% in the third quarter last year. Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 27.8%. A comparable effective tax rate to 2015 would be 30.5%.", "For full year 2016, we expect our effective tax rate to be in the low 30%s, excluding the impact of the accounting change. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 2.8% to $4.08 per share from $3.97 per share in 2015. The $4.08 includes $0.09 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.24 dilution from acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation rate changes decreased earnings per share by $0.03 in the quarter.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the third quarter 2016 increased $140.6 million or 6.7% to $2.23 billion from $2.09 billion last year. Comparable store sales, that is, sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, excluding the change in revenue classification, increased 2.1%. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due to higher architectural paint sales volume across most end market segments and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Price mix had a negligible impact on sales in the quarter and Protective & Marine Coatings sales were a significant drag on revenue growth.", "Regionally in the third quarter, our Canadian division led all divisions, followed by Southeastern division, Southwestern division, Midwest and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.", "Segment profit for the group increased $10.9 million, or 2.1% to $518.3 million in the quarter, as higher architectural paint and equipment sales volumes were partially offset by higher SG&A spending. Segment operating margin decreased 100 basis points to 23.3% of sales from 24.3% in the third quarter last year.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, third quarter net sales, stated in U.S. dollars, was $156.6 million, up $618,000, due primarily to higher year-over-year selling prices that were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and volume declines. Currency translation rate changes decreased sales in U.S. dollars by $12.8 million or 8.2% in the quarter.", "Segment profit in the third quarter, stated in U.S. dollars, decreased $1.2 million or 54.6% to $1 million from $2.1 million in the same period last year. The negative impact from higher raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation was only partially offset by increased selling prices.", "Currency translation decreased segment profit $3.6 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. As a percent of net sales, segment profit decreased to 60 basis points in the quarter compared to 1.4% in the third quarter 2015.", "For our Consumer Group, sales decreased $8.7 million or 2.1% to $412.9 million from $421.6 million last year, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and declining sales to certain retail accounts, commercial customers and in our European business. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $5 million or 1.2%.", "Segment profit for the Consumer Group increased $3.8 million or 4.3% to $92 million from $88.3 million last year, due to improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 22.3% from 20.9% in the same period last year.", "For our Global Finishes Group, sales in U.S. dollars decreased $5.4 million or 1.1% to $480.7 million in the quarter, as unfavorable currency translation was partially offset by positive price mix. Unfavorable currency translation decreased net sales for the segment by $7.1 million or 1.5% in the quarter.", "Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased $8 million or 14.6% in the quarter to $63.2 million from $55.1 million last year, due primarily to good SG&A expense control. Unfavorable currency translation decreased segment profit $0.5 million in the quarter. As a percent to net external sales, Global Finishes Group segment profit increased to 13.1% from 11.3% in the quarter compared to last year.", "That concludes my recap of our results for the quarter. So, I will turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year.", "John?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Our results for the third quarter include a number of unusual items that affect our revenues, expenses and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our results on a comparable year-over-year basis showed modest improvement. Consolidated sales increased 1.7% to $3.2 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.9%, an increase of 100 basis points compared to the third quarter last year. Operating profit improved 1.9% to $591.8 million. Profit before tax grew 3.9% to $572.4 million, a 30 basis point increase as a percent of sales. Net income increased 6.2% to $397.9 million and earnings per share increased 6.5% to $4.23 per share.", "These results are consistent with the GAAP guidance ranges we provided for both revenue and earnings, but they fell short of what we envisioned at the start of the quarter.", "Revenue growth at the lower end of our low single-digit to mid-single-digit range was disappointing. And the ongoing investments we are making in new stores, sales territories, retail merchandising, advertising, training and store service weighed heavily on earnings, particularly in light of the slow revenue growth.", "Our sales trend by quarter so far this year is similar to last year with growth decelerating each quarter as we go through the year. At this point, it is unclear whether the mid-year slowdown in sales over the past two years is a result of labor constraints in the construction trades or an indication that the housing cycle is slowing, which is contrary to what most of the data would suggest, or something else entirely. Whatever the reason for the slowdown, our response is the same. We will continue to make prudent investments in the things that drive our long-term growth and profitability.", "Architectural paint sales through our Paint Stores Group once again significantly outpaced revenue growth for the segment as a whole. High single-digit growth in the new residential and residential repaint contractor business was partially offset by a modest, but unexpected year-over-year decline in DIY sales.", "Sales to commercial and healthcare customers also generated solid year-over-year growth, while the Property Management segment showed modest gains. The outlook for continued growth in residential markets over the balance of the year and into 2017 remains positive, supported by very healthy order book trends, reported by most of our contractor customers.", "On the other hand, the revenue headwind from our Protective & Marine business in Paint Stores worsened sequentially in the third quarter.", "During the first nine months of the year, Paint Stores Group opened 69 new stores and closed 14 redundant locations, completing our consolidation of redundant store locations acquired from Comex. Our plan for the year still calls for the store openings in a range of 90 to 100 net new locations. To-date, our store count in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean stands at 4,141 compared to 4,048 a year ago.", "Finally, the upward inflection in input costs and operating expenses that we've seen in the recent months, including raw materials, wages and benefits, rent expense and more, warrant a price increase by our Paint Stores Group. Effective December 1, 2016, our Paint Stores Group will be implementing a price increase in the 4% to 5% range across most product lines.", "We also anticipated a stronger sales performance from our Consumer Group coming into the third quarter. We saw widespread weakness across our commercial, industrial and MRO customers. Our Ronseal brand business in Europe also had a soft quarter. Despite the weaker than expected sales results, the Consumer Group continued to show good progress on margins in the quarter.", "Our Global Finishes Group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a 180 basis point operating margin improvement on modest sales declines. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses, primarily in Europe and in Asia.", "Finally, our Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth in the quarter for the first time in 12 quarters. Despite this improvement in revenue and volume momentum, margin pressure from raw materials and higher SG&A spending continue to challenge our profitability throughout the region.", "Third quarter was a strong quarter for cash generation. Net operating cash in the first nine months was $966.5 million, up about $64 million over last year, with third quarter accounting for about $456 million of the total. We're on pace again this year to generate net operating cash at a rate above 10% of net sales. We were at 10.7% year-to-date, despite higher working capital.", "Nine-month working capital ticked up slightly to 11.5% of sales from 11.1% last year. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends was $560 million compared to $557 million last year. Our capital expenditures year-to-date totaled $173.1 million. Depreciation was $128.3 million and amortization was $20.2 million.", "In 2016, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $240 million, depreciation of $170 million to $180 million and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will run higher than normal in 2016 as we complete some facility renovations projects.", "During the quarter, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for Treasury. On September 30, we had remaining board authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares. As indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the year to reduce total borrowings required to close the deal, which will eliminate our share repurchase activity in 2016.", "As a result, our cash balance at the close of the third quarter 2016 was $702.6 million compared to $91 million on September 30, 2015. Last week, our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.84 per share, up 25% from $0.67 last year.", "The outlook for Paint Stores Group over the balance of the year remains positive, and we expect to see steady improvement from Consumer Group and Global Finishes Group. These positives will be offset to some degree by continued weakness in Latin America. Over the balance of the year, the input cost tailwinds are likely to turn to headwinds and the slower pace of sales growth is unlikely to fully offset our investment in new stores, territories and retail programs already in place.", "For the quarter, we anticipate our core consolidated net sales will increase a low single-digit percentage compared to last year's fourth quarter. At this anticipated sales level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share. Fourth quarter 2016 earnings per share include costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar totaling $0.71 per share and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.03 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, fourth quarter EPS will be in the range of $2.13 to $2.23 per share compared to $2.12 per share earned in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "For the full year 2016, we expect core consolidated net sales to increase by a low single-digit percentage compared to full year 2015. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our guidance for full year 2016 diluted net income per common share to be in the range of $11.30 to $11.40 per share.", "Full year 2016 earnings per share includes costs related to the anticipated acquisition of Valspar, totaling approximately $1.35 per share, and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.40 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Excluding these items, full year EPS will be in the range of $12.25 to $12.35 per share, a 10% increase at the midpoint of the range over the $11.16 per share earned in 2015.", "Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to comment briefly on the other press release we issued this morning. Last week, our board of directors elected Al Mistysyn to serve as our next Chief Financial Officer, a position held for the past 15 years by Sean Hennessy. This change will take effect January 1, 2017.", "I'd like to close my comments with a few words about my great friend, Sean Hennessy. My relationship with Sean spans our 30 years together at Sherwin-Williams. He has always been an excellent advisor, contributor, and importantly, friend. We've traveled around the world together on many occasions and Sean has regularly impressed me in so many ways. So, it's no surprise that Sean has once again impressed me with his selfless decision to do what he believes to be right for his family.", "Sean's decision to step down from the day-to-day responsibilities of CFO in order to provide more time and flexibility to address family priorities is yet another example of the quality individual we've all grown to respect.", "We appreciate his willingness to stay on as Head of M&A activities, to provide support for the Valspar integration planning process, and to ensure a smooth transition of CFO responsibilities.", "This past year, I've spent more time with Sean than any other executive on my team, travelling with many of you, to immerse myself in this important aspect of my job, and to gain as much information as I could from Sean, knowing this time was coming. Well, it's never a good time for a high performing executive like Sean to leave such an important role. The timing of his decision sets us up well for the year ahead.", "Now, Mistysyn's promotion to CFO is the natural conclusion of a long, careful and thoughtful development plan to prepare him for this position. Al has been Sean's right hand man, and the architect of many of our financial programs and successes. Al is my choice for this important position. He is a proven seasoned executive and I'm truly excited to have him on my side as we move forward.", "We've assembled a full Valspar integration team that has been hard at it for several months now, with Al actively involved on a daily basis. We're also in the process of building our operating plans and budgets for next year, with each of our segment teams and having Al on my side for these important meetings is crucial to his fast start.", "With that, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Perfect. Thank you very much. Can you guys just add a little more color on the key trends throughout the quarter both from an end market perspective and geographic perspective. And how that rolled through Europe, PSG, same-store sales comp. And then also, if you could comment just very quickly on any margin differential pertaining to the reclassification of revenues? Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. So initially, I would maybe add sort of this way. We did see high single-digit growth in our new residential and our residential repaint business. We saw a solid year-over-year increases in our commercial and our healthcare businesses, and modest gains in our Property Management. As I mentioned, just a moment ago, we did see a modest decline in DIY, and our P&M worsened sequentially. So, our outlook obviously remains very positive. We see the fundamentals of the business are very solid, and have great confidence in the investments that we're making that we're going to continue to be able to grow market share. We talked \u2013 actually Bob just covered geographically about the growth with Canada leading the market, and talked about the different geographies. So, I think we captured that in the comments just a moment ago.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, Chris. And importantly \u2013 this is Bob. Importantly, we mentioned that the Eastern division was down the most and it's likely that that was at least some weather impact, because they had inclement weather in the quarter.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hey, Chris, this is Al Mistysyn. I'm going to talk about the revenue reclass. And I'll just talk about it broadly, and then talk about the impact on the operating margin. But, we use third-party contractors to complete a variety of things for our customers. Previously, these immaterial amounts were netted and then included in the SG&A. We determine these buildings to customers should be grossed up as sales with a payments contract as included in cost to goods sold for a net immaterial impact on gross profit while reducing gross margin and operating margin. So, no impact on the consolidated dollars, but excluding that revenue reclass and the impact of the acquisitions, our operating margins would have been up slightly.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Perfect. Thank you. And then just very quickly, within the big boxes, can you just comment on any key trends you saw during the quarter between DIY and DIFM? And whether or not are there any major puts or takes based on your new products specifically INFINITY? Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, we prefer to let our customers talk about the trends within those areas. We do work very hard to work with them, to support them, and we're proud of that INFINITY product. We think it provides a terrific technology for an important customer of ours, but we'd prefer to let them comment about their specific results.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. You suggested that you're going to increase your paint prices here in the stores as of January 1, 2017. Is that the limit of your price increases or are there other areas where you plan to nominate increases for 2017?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "We made it a practice, Jeff, to talk about our stores pricing. We prefer not to talk about pricing outside of the stores organization.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And, Jeff, this is Sean, I just want to \u2013 you mentioned January first, so I just wanted to put on your radar, it's going to be effective December 1.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "That's right.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. I'm sorry about that. Okay. Is there also a revenue readjustment to come in the fourth quarter from your accounting change or is it taken care of in the third quarter?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, Jeff, this is Al. We did the adjustment because it's immaterial on a perspective basis, so the third quarter only has a third quarter adjustment, the fourth quarter will have an adjustment and then we will make a first quarter and second quarter of 2017, so the full year 2017 won't have any impact.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "All right. Okay. Thank you so much. And the fourth quarter adjustment is something of the same magnitude as the third quarter or it's different?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "It will be similar.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And in general, the revenues are offset by increased cost of goods sold.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes.", "Jeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Good. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Sean and Al, congrats, and, Sean, you'll obviously be missed by all of us.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hey. Thank you. I appreciate that.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "So I guess going back to same-store sales for PSG, just kind of being erratic over the past few quarters, you're obviously bullish on the outlook. I guess, John, what are customers, in particular, sharing with you in terms of why growth has been so choppy quarter-by-quarter?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Your point is a good one. The confidence that we have, we believe is built on the fundamentals of the market and we continue to believe that investing in this business is going to be a key part of our success, but the contractors that we've spoken to continue to believe that there are plenty of opportunities ahead. I mentioned the residential business that we saw growing, nearly double-digit increase in residential repaint over 9%. And speaking to these customers about the constraints that they feel as a result of the labor has had an impact on their business.", "So, we're confident in this model that we have. We're continuing to invest in it. We believe that the investment in our stores, reps and products are going to continue to allow us to continue drive that operating margin. We're going to have a good operating margin improvement this year. We expect to have a good operating margin improvement next year, and we think that the fundamentals of the market support the contractor base that we're focused on.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then just...", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Ghansham, this is Bob. Let me fill in that based on our volumes by quarter, it appears to us that the third quarter is the busiest quarter for contractors. So, if there is labor constraints in the market, it would most likely show up in the third quarter, or it would show up more in the third quarter than even in the second quarter.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then, for just sticking with PSG and same-store sales, if you stripped out Protective & Marine, can you give us a sense as to what their same-store sales would have looked like? And then, on P&M, are we, John, sort of, at least in your perspective, close to realistic bottom for this business? Thanks so much.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. I'll take the first piece on the bottom of the P&M. We do feel as though that we're nearing bottom. This has been a tough road here with the oil and gas predominantly under a lot of pressure. We have, as I mentioned in previous calls, worked to pivot our efforts into accelerating in other segments where we've been focused on for many years, but we expect to be able to accelerate our sales in those areas. The fact is that the oil and gas is a big part of our business. It's been an area that we've been focused on for many years, and we've had significant success, and it's had an impact on our business as it's slowing down. But, we're continuing to growing in areas within oil and gas, as well as some of these other areas within Protective & Marine.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. And if you look at the comp stores, I don't have it exactly, but it would be in the mid-single digits.", "Ghansham Panjabi - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Thanks for confirming.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Great.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Ghansham.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yes. Bob, a question on the overall market. I mean, we've seen lower growth from other companies who've reported in the architectural space as well. So, just wondering, snapback that we are all expecting this year, because it \u2013 you know, easy weather comps from last year. Did that not materialize or whether there's some volumes that were brought forward in a very strong first quarter you had? Just wondering what comments you'd have on the overall market growth?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, Don, in John's prepared remarks, he talked about the sales trend or the sales trajectory by a quarter being similar this year to last year. And we think that's a reflection of the market overall. We're seeing that, that year-over-year growth tends to slow as we go from even second quarter to third quarter sequentially. And we're not sure if that's the function of market capacity or it doesn't feel to us like it's a change in demand trend. Our customers are still reporting very strong order book volume, and so it doesn't feel like third quarter jobs were pulled forward into first quarter and second quarter. It just feels like we're seeing some constraints in the rate at which contractors can get on those jobs.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. The overall tone from our customers remains very positive on the architectural side.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "And then a follow-up on your guidance reduction. Is that driven primarily by volumes or how much of a role did raw materials play, you know, are raw materials now going to go \u2013 be up more than you expected for the industry in 2016 and what's your outlook for 2017?", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I'll take the fourth quarter. I think it was driven by the volume side. I don't think that the raws are materially different than what we took a look at.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. On raw materials side, Don, we think it's likely that the raw materials will swing from a low single-digit tailwind in the third quarter to a low single-digit headwind in the fourth quarter, but we've kind of being guiding to that all along. We've said that the benefit from raw materials will diminish as we go through the year. The headwind, if there is one in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by modest inflation in TiO2. The TiO2 producers got some traction on both their second quarter and third quarter price increases during the year \u2013 or during the second quarters and third quarters.", "So, we haven't put together an outlook for 2017 yet, but fourth quarter 2016, it's going to be flat to \u2013 raw materials are going to be flat to up low single digits.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Good morning, Arun.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Congrats, Sean.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Just I guess I wanted to follow up on the growth question. Over the last several years, we've seen Paint Stores Group kind of grow 1.5 times to 2 times the market. This quarter, it looks like the 2% growth is kind of in line with the market. Is that a fair assessment and is there anything that changed that led to this kind of performance? And then also in Consumer, it looks like the 2% decline is kind of bit below, and you just discussed that a modest decline in DIY, maybe you can just help us understand what drove that?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. I think it's a bit early to tell if there's the issue with market, I don't think we have enough data right now to know how our growth in the market compared to our competitors. Our third quarter last year showed the same sequential softness, as Bob mentioned before rebounding in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. And as I mentioned, we believe that the growth that we saw in the architectural side in residential repaint and new residential, a very high strong performance, the solid year in commercial and healthcare that I mentioned as well as the modest gains in Property Management, we still feel as that we're growing share, and most importantly I would say would be the fundamentals, the position that we have in the marketplace with the contractor continuing to outpace the market and our positioning there and our continued investment there is what gives us the most confidence. These stores that we're adding, the reps that we're adding, the new products that we're adding as well as our core locations we believe will allow us to continue to grow our share.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "When you ask about the Consumer Group, again our Consumer Group this quarter was negatively affected by the European businesses as well as some of the commercial, industrial and MRO that are also embedded in there. So if you look at the North American architectural business, we were pleased with those results.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And if you back out the European business, our North American business was positive.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, just as a quick follow-up on the price in raw materials side, usually you take pricing I guess in the beginning of the year. Is there a reason that you kind of pulled that forward, you discussed the low single-digit headwind. But presumably, if you're announcing it December 1, you won't see that in Q4. So, is it safe to assume that that'll start flowing through in Q1 or what's the cadence on realizing that pricing?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, I think it speaks to what we've spoken about frequently which is, when we know, we typically go. And the fact is that, the last price increase as you know that we took was in the first quarter of 2014. Many of our operating expense categories have risen since then, our wage and benefits, our store rent and presumably, as Bob just mentioned, we're going to see some raw material increases. And so, we knew it was time for a price increase and we decided to go ahead and move on it.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, and good afternoon and good morning. Within Paint Stores Group, obviously, the results were below your expectations. And you outlined the different sub-segments of it. But it wasn't clear to me, which one of those came in below your expectations. You talked about high single-digit residential; doesn't seem like it would be that. So, was it DIY, was it the healthcare or Protective & Marine, what went wrong?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, I think obviously our DIY with a modest decline was clearly below our expectation. For Protective & Marine, we still have high expectations for this team. We recognize that a big percentage of the business is growing in this oil and gas. But we are focused on a number of these other segments. And we have been involved in these other areas and our expectations for all our teams are to continue to improve. So, I'd tell you that even our residential repaint up in nearly double digits, our expectations are that we want to grow faster. So, clearly some of those underperformed to a little greater degree in the DIY and P&M, Protective & Marine that I mentioned, but it's safe to say that our expectations are we want to grow faster in every one of those segments.", "Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then, just a follow-up, internally, as you guys assess the weather impact on any given quarter, do you have any particular means by which you do that? I mean I think about a hurricane going up the Gulf Coast \u2013 sorry, up the East Coast in September. Then we had another one in October for the fourth quarter. So, how do you guys think about assessing the impact of lost painting days or even 4th of July moved a day during this quarter from a Saturday to a Monday? So what is the impact of that type of stuff and is it worth speaking about in advance to the extent that we know about it?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "We don't like to talk about it, to be truthful with you. I mean our discussion internally as you mentioned is that we've got shareholders with high expectations, and we've got to find a way over the hill. And yes, we had to close stores in areas that were affected, but we're not leaning on that. We have a determined effort on this side of the call to continue to drive and improve. And quite frankly, it's something that we don't want to point to. We know it was there...", "Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "...but we have high expectations of ourselves.", "Vincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I appreciate that. I'm not looking for excuses. I just want the explanation and it might be helpful going forward just to understand the change in results, particularly as they get more lumpy. But I'll pass it along. Thanks very much.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Vincent.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes, good morning, fellows.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Good morning, Duffy.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Good morning, Duffy.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Question just as you think through the incremental margins, sales were down in both Consumer Group and Global Finishes, but yet income was up. So what was happening there that you were able to drive better income results than revenue results?", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Duffy, this is Sean. I think it really goes back to just the lumpiness, the question that we asked earlier I think, as John said, when you look at the year-to-date, I think that just the way different sales and SG&A comes in, in these different areas. So, I think when you take a look at the full year in Global Finishes back in 2014, the operating margin was 9.7%, last year it was 10.5%, this year through the first nine months it's 12.3%. So, we look at it more that way.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. And I'd add this to it, Duffy, that organization, that team is doing a terrific job as well I think, at looking at opportunities, back office expenses where we can take some synergies through the organization. They've also got a strong focus on customers and positive mix of products. So, we knew that this was going to be a challenging year for them, and they went into it with the right frame of mind that we had to show improvement, and we had to pull a number of different levers to be able to get there. And they're working hard to do just that.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And then on Consumer Group, a similar trend. If you look at 2014 operating margin at 17.8%, going to 19.6% last year and up 40 basis points year-to-date, they're doing a nice job of controlling SG&A and getting operating efficiencies with the volumes that we're generating through Paint Stores Group.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then on oil and gas, when was the peak of your oil and gas sales, and what's the magnitude of the headwind do you face revenue-wise since that peak?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I don't know of the exact timing of the...", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think it very externally (43:27) correlates to the price of oil. I think...", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. I was just going to say it.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. I don't know the exact date, but I think as the price of oil came down, the CapEx spending began to decrease and I think \u2013 and that's why we're in the situation we are.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. So, obviously impacted by the CapEx spending that Sean talked about and as we mentioned the opportunity to pivot into some of these other areas. Infrastructures is an area that the team is focused on as well as some of the other segments within our focus there. So, plenty of opportunity here; some heavy lifting to do.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks, fellows.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you, Duffy.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Good morning, Bob.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "John, I was wondering if you could talk about, are there prior precedence where you've taken up price in the stores that there has been pressure in the DIY channel and I guess I ask that in the context of your major DIY competitor talked about increased promotions and rebates and those sorts of things. So it looks like maybe there is some pressure on price through DIY. So, what's your thoughts about historically being able to push through the stores prices if the broader DIY market might be under some pressure?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Bob, I've been in this industry now, coming up on 32 years and every day of my experience has been competitive. We work hard in what we do to add value to our customers. And as I mentioned, a piece of this, we expect will be raw materials, the other components that we have invested in to be able to supply our customers with a greater value are key drivers for our ability to put a price increase in, and we don't take that lightly. To your point, we know it's competitive. We've got to be able to demonstrate a value to our customers. And so, the combination of our products and our services have to make our customers more money of what they do or we don't deserve the business. And we understand how competitive it is out there. And so, we're investing in the right things to better position ourselves to better help our customers.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Makes sense. And then let me ask if I could on the \u2013 Bob Wells, I think you talked about low single-digit raws' inflation. John, you mentioned 4% to 5% seeking price in your stores business. How should we think about the gross margin path into 2017?", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think that 2017, when you look at it, we're very focused on operating margins, as you know, you've been with us for many, many years. And I think over the last three years-plus, the gross margin has been driving those margins. I think that we all know that the gross margin is not going to be as robust when it comes to year-over-year. I think that we're going to continue to do things for efficiencies in the plants and warehouse. The price increase to make sure that the gross margin is somewhat positive as I read it, but it's not going to be the driver it's been for the last three years, but that operating margin is going to be also helped by the work that we're going to do in the SG&A.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. Every year, is different as you know, Bob, and we set out with a plan on January 1, and by January 2 it changes depending on what's happening in the market. And the one thing that will be true to Sean's point is our focus on this operating margin improvement. And so, the efforts that we'll be taking will get us there. We'll figure out a way to do that. It may, as Sean mentioned, not be the margins in the past, it may be greater leverage on the SG&A while driving sales. But our commitment is the improvement in operating margins going forward.", "Robert Andrew Koort - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks for the help.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Bob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Sean, you've been a great CFO, but I still don't think your stock would take it this hard that you're going to be phasing back.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. I know what you mean.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Wishes going forward. You're going to open up about 40 stores in the fourth quarter here, which I think you've done before, you're usually backend loaded, but could you talk a little bit about the labor market for staffing 40 stores in a quarter and lease rates and things like that? I'd assume store openings are costing you more now than they probably ever have?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I don't know if they are costing us more than we ever had, and in our ability to recruit on campus has been terrific. We hire as you know, John, having travelled with us, between 1,200 and 1,400 management trainees a year. The performance of our company and the brand has allowed us to recruit the highest caliber trainees and you know, I'd say that that just continues, the more time I spend with our trainee class, the more I'm impressed with our ability to recruit such high caliber people.", "So, we've got confidence there. We've been able to negotiate good rents and leases with our track record. And we're becoming more and more choice in these markets, because of our ability to ensure the financial strength of the company, and what we bring to the market. So, we're actually in a very good place right now and our focus continues to be on accelerating the performance of those new stores.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "And then secondarily, do you think the down DIY volume has anything to do with the channel positioning in advance of the Valspar closing?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, I don't think so. I think that we'll see what happens in the market on DIY specifically, but I don't think that it has an impact on it at all.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Oli Wintermantel with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC", "Yes. Good morning, guys.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Good morning, Oli.", "Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC", "Regarding the comps throughout the quarter, did we see a very similar progression throughout the quarter that we saw through the year or so, beginning if the quarter was stronger and then tailing off?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I don't understand.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, I think we were pretty consistent on the cadence of sales throughout the quarter.", "Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC", "Okay. Got it. And then, just you mentioned that on the total sales, there was a 2.3% help on the revenue reclassification. Was there a similar impact on the comps in PSG?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, the comps in PSG were not impacted by the change in revenue reclass.", "Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC", "Got it. And then lastly, just the reduction in the full year guidance, you left the sales guidance up low single digits, basically unchanged. So is that more of a function of gross margins or SG&A?", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think, it comes back to I think the \u2013 it probably had more to do with the sales volumes in the third quarter than anything else.", "Oliver Wintermantel - Evercore Group LLC", "Got it. Thanks very much.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Oli.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Couple of questions, first of all just wanted to follow up on the Paint Store comp, so you had 2.1% same-store growth and you had 2.3% from the reclassification of revenue, which still leaves about 2.5% or 2.3% sort of unaccounted for. Is that the price mix benefit or how should I think about classifying that especially since you've talked about a little bit of an FX headwind?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "You also have to factor in the new stores in that delta and then the rest of the price mix.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Price mix, okay. Fair enough. If you look at \u2013 you mentioned a couple of times that higher SG&A expense in the Stores Group in Latin America grew. Was that around just store openings or was \u2013 I mean or promotional activity or are you staffing external sales people more, can you talk about sort of what's driving the higher SG&A and why we should not look for that to continue into 2017?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "The majority of the SG&A increase was related to the new store and reps. I think the teams are doing a nice job of controlling the other SG&A around the fringes, based on the sequential slowdown in sales.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. But I mean your store growth this year is not that different from what it was last year and yet you called out SG&A expense. So, that's why I'm asking I guess.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "We also had, if you recall in the second quarter, we talked about the investments we were making in the Consumer Group and some of those have continued through. So, between the new stores and the continued investments in Consumer Group, that's what's driving the increase in SG&A.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. All right. And then just a quick question on tax rate, you talked about it being in the low 30%s for 2016. If you kind of look at Sherwin in isolation, and forget about the Valspar piece that's being added and what that can do to your tax rate, if you just look at Sherwin, is kind of the low 30%s tax rate is what we should be thinking about or the changes in taxes that you made, that were excluding from this year's earnings, how should we think about tax rate going into 2017 and Sherwin-Williams as a standalone entity without thinking about Valspar yet?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, I think the core tax rate's excluding that, accounting adjustment, it will be in the low 30%s. If you look at our year-to-date effective tax rate, it's 31.7% versus 31.6% last year.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So basically, just continuation of the tax rate that we've seen?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. All right, thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Dmitry.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question?", "Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.", "Yes, good morning. I recognize Europe is not an enormous region for you, but to the extent that you are exposed there, I was wondering if you could comment on trends that you're seeing by product line and also on an individual country basis if you're seeing anything material there. It sounds like it hit Consumer a bit. And I'm wondering you know if you think that it's macro or broad based in nature or more idiosyncratic. Thanks.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think when you look at the business we have in Europe, I think we're not broad based at all. I think that we don't have any architectural business in Europe. So, we're not probably a good barometer of what's happening there. On the industrial side, we're probably heavy in industrial wood, but that's in the Global Finishes Group and that's actually been strong \u2013 stable I'd say, I'll use the word stable.", "So, I think to try to get some type of barometer of Europe, we're not a very good indicator event.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.", "Clear enough. And then second question if I may, possibly for Bob, I think you mentioned your commercial business was up. I was wondering if you could speak to non-res more broadly on your third quarter experience and your term outlook. Thanks.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, Kevin. As a reminder, there is a pretty long lag between a non-residential start on average and when that project is painted. So, we are benefiting from fairly strong start activity 18 months ago to two years ago. And as a result, the commercial business is holding up quite well. It's not as strong as the residential segments. John indicated the residential businesses are up in the high single digits. It's not that strong, but it's really solid year-over-year growth. The dark lining around that silver cloud is that starts this year are actually down year-over-year. So, we're seeing some weakness in new projects started that if that persist, was going to impact our commercial business a couple of years out.", "Kevin W. McCarthy - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.", "Okay.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "But for the time being, it's good.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Good morning, Mike.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Was wondering if you could talk a little bit about Latin America. It was nice to see it get back above breakeven, and you've added about 25 stores this year. So can you talk a little bit about the strategy going forward, and what the outlook might be, should we expect it to remain above breakeven or could some of those investments start to weigh on the performance on the bottom line?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. So, our approach in Latin America is really market specific, not even country specific. We understand that there are locations in the market throughout the Latin American region where the direct store model might be best, and there might be others that are best utilized through home centers or through dealers and our team down there is working very hard to upgrade our position in the marketplace, and by doing what we believe to be the heavy lifting now while the market is maybe choppy, might be an understatement, but while taking those steps now that we'll be better able to participate at a greater rate once the market does improve.", "We do feel as though that it's hit a trough. It's too early to tell if it's improvement in the market is sustainable there, the choppiness in sales and profit likely to continue over the next few quarters, but we really do believe that the steps that we're taking right now are going to better position us by allowing for a better employee base that we have down there, better product line, more consistent products, and a much more efficient path to the customer than what we've had in the past. So, our expectations of what we're doing down there are clearly to outperform the market as we move forward.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And I would add that going forward of course, you'd expect them to be closer to breakeven.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "All right. And you've also talked about some of the SG&A expense control. I was wondering if you could talk at all about your marketing and advertising expenses, and how those have trended during the year. At this point, are we running meaningfully above or below what we might think of as normal advertising expenses?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No. I don't think we're meaningfully above or below. I think we're right around the same paces we've been in the past. We're trying to be as smart and efficient with what we're doing with media. But I wouldn't say that we've jumped or cut to anything in a meaningful way.", "Michael Joseph Harrison - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Hey, good morning.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Quick question, I mean, your feedback that you're relaying from the field despite slower sales growth than you expected, is pretty positive on this call. But, I think in your prepared remarks, John, you noted that you're not sure if the housing cycle might be slowing or we might be in the later innings. So, being a good bridge is there's two comments, because it sounds a lot more bullish on the Q&A than what you may have said on the prepared remarks?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, my point was that we certainly saw a slowdown in the third quarter, Scott. And our feeling continues to be that the fundamentals still support the market in a very positive way. And, I know, you've heard Bob talk about those in a number of occasions. But, if you just look at household formations, new home sales, single family start permits, re-sales, the underserved entry into the new residential by builders, the fundamentals continue to be there. And, we expect that the contractor is going to be the benefactor of many of these opportunities and our position with that contractor is something that we're continuing to improve them.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And, by the way, Scott, maybe it wasn't worded as well as it could have been, but John's opening remarks basically said, if it's a slowdown in the housing cycle contrary to all \u2013 with all the data would suggest. So, he was kind of qualifying it by saying, we're not seeing it in the data; but if it is, we're still going to invest in the thing that drive our growth.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. I appreciate this, clarifying that. And just to kind of reiterate, is this I guess more uncertainty to the cadence of how the business is growing, have any impact on to how you are thinking about incremental investment back into the business and/or on the synergy guidance for Valspar?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I believe that our investments will continue as you've seen. This is a year that's going to have record sales, record profit, record operating margin. We're going to continue to invest in those drivers that we believe will allow us to drive that operating margin further and that's going to be in new stores, new reps, new products and we believe that the contractors positioned as I said, very well in the market and our positions, we're going to be working very hard to improve that. And we've got confidence in that model and we've got confidence in our ability to execute it.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. I just have a couple of quick ones. In terms of your sales growth for the fourth quarter for the year not really changing out that much, is that just more of a function \u2013 is that more of a function of the reclassification, so reclassification in the fourth quarter is going to be 2% impact, I guess sales would be flat to down excluding that?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, I think that just low-single digit is on the core, it's just movement within the core \u2013 within that range.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. And then, in terms of Valspar, is there any sort of change here, expectations that's going to close in the first quarter or expectation if one will here, it's something about a ruling?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, at this time we still believe this is going to be in the first quarter. We're down to just a few countries and we're feeling positive about the momentum that we have.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then last, does the currency in Latin America, does that turn into a tailwind starting in the fourth quarter?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No. I think it'll still be a headwind, I guess on somewhat to what we saw in the third quarter.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Ivan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Two questions for you. First of all, Bob or Sean or Allen, if you could review what we should be thinking about in terms of price, understand that increase becomes effective December 1, which I think is a little different language than you had in the past. Curious, what we should be assuming in terms of the time to implement and the amount of that, that should be expected to be realized?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. I think that we've in the past have said that we've been 75% effective when you take a look at the increase. So, 4.5% to 5%, you're talking, use it 4.5 times, 75%, you're talking just over 3%. I think that we've constantly said that we're working to trying to get that quicker. I think you'll see some effect in December, but it will be muted. And I think that the first quarter, you'll see hopefully somewhere in that 50% effectiveness, and then, from then on I think you'll see it at 75%.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then, secondly, we'd just love a little perspective, I think the statement was made that the store comp would be 5% x-Protective & Marine, and I'm curious within that or if you want to speak to the expectation of the architectural business, how that compares to the prior couple of quarters and what the expectation should be of that moving forward?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. I think that the architectural and if you look at the quarters there's no doubt the first quarter was the strongest quarter. Architecturally, second was the second strongest and then the third. But I do believe, when you take a look at it, some of these, the third quarter was probably way down because of that DIY component that we talked about. So I think again, I think the John's comments about the strength of the market of why we could continue to invest and feel good about the \u2013 what kind of results we can produce in this Paint Stores Group are still driven by those spots on the architectural side.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Excluding DIY, are you capable of looking through the numbers or sharing with us excluding DIY, it sounds like the resi-repaint was up high single-digits versus perhaps low double-digits. What's other than DIY, it seems like the other pieces of architectural slowed a bit in 3Q relative to its 2Q growth, is that accurate?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "And any thoughts on the driver to that?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I will tell you this is, yeah, I think that labor you know \u2013 we're seeing things such as labor constrain some of these results that we're having in some of these quarters.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah, Eric, it's not uncommon at all to hear contractors talk about their ability to do more work, if they had more qualified labor.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Eric.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks and a lot of questions have been asked. I appreciate you let me sneak one in here. So, I was just wondering from your perspective, obviously we have this dichotomy between the pro market, the contractor market and do-it-yourself. As you guys think back over the years the company, I mean you've ever seen this kind of divergence in the two, and in your opinion, what do you think's causing it, I mean it seems like consumer for some reason is a little weaker, I mean we're seeing that across a lot of different sectors and I'm just trying to understand, from your perspective, what you think is kind of going on. Have you ever seen this before, so anything you can shed, any light...", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah, Scott. This is Bob. We've talked for a long time about this long-term secular trend away from DIY toward the contractor. And we saw that kind of step back in the direction of DIY during the 2008, 2009 cycle. And since that time, we think that there has been a pretty strong migration back toward the pro. What we've observed in past cycles is that when we see a period of rapid home value appreciation, in many cases, it will accelerate the move back to the pro.", "People are more incline to hire a professional when they're feeling more positive about the equities that they have in their home. So, the last three years, pretty rapid home value appreciation that we've seen may have accelerated this migration away from DIY and toward the pro. That's the best we've got; there is no empirical data as to why that's happening.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Could I do a follow-up quick, Bob, is that all right?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. You bet.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "Yeah. So, there's obviously been a lot of thoughts regarding millennials, younger households are probably more do-it-yourself versus do-it-for-me. Still want a buzz that millennials are finally kicking it into gear, but what you're saying to me maybe argues against that, I wonder if you have any thoughts on that piece as well? And then, thanks.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, we certainly agree that millennials will be a stronger driver in the housing market going forward. I mean there's forecast of between 13.5 million and 17 million new first-time home buyers, coming into the market in the next five years, which is really exciting to us, and all due respect for the younger generations, we disagree with the notion that millennials are strong DIY'ers. They have not shown to be at nearly the levels that their parents were. Baby boomers were far more DIY involved than their offspring, and you know, it certainly has a lot to do with schedules nowadays being very tight and lack of free time. But, we don't necessarily see the millennials coming into the home buying market as driving DIY the way the baby boomers did a generation ago.", "Scott A. Mushkin - Wolfe Research LLC", "That's perfect. It of course argues to your business model too, so that's good news for the long-term. Anyway, thanks, guys. Really appreciate it.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You noted that keeping strong control on your SG&A cost just going to help your operating income line going forward, and of course that was represented in most of the segments. But you also did note some of the headwind in the Paint Stores Group. So, I'm curious, where will the incremental discipline come on the SG&A; is it going to be in the Paint Stores Group? And if so, how that affects your investment there? And if it's not in the Paint Stores Group, where would it be, because it seems you're pretty disciplined across the board?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. So, it's going to be across the board. And I think as you look at our opportunities going forward, the ability to leverage SG&A in every organization exist, I mentioned earlier about the Global Finishes Group taking a look at a number of the areas in the back office to become more efficient. We have those opportunities throughout the organization. What we're committed to though are those areas that are customer-facing and continuing to invest in this model. We just talked with the previous questioner about the long-term model and why it fits and why we believe in it.", "So, you're going to continue to see us invest in new stores, territories, new products, the things that allow us to differentiate ourselves from our competition and you should expect us to continue to be animals on expenses. We had a discussion last week about our budgeting process and I mentioned Al coming on board and same discipline that we've had with Sean in the past. We're going into our operating plan process, we're starting at ground zero and we're ripping every expense out that we can that doesn't affect sales.", "And so, we want to be that disciplined about what it is we're doing. We don't want to point to past success and justify future expense. We want to be invested in those things that are going to drive our business and we're committed to doing that in the models that will drive the operating margin that we've talked about.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Fair enough. And just as a follow-up. You note the weakness in oil and gas on the Protective & Marine, but there are a certain number of chemical projects coming out in the Gulf Coast. So, is it just that the size of oil and gas is so heighted, offset whatever is going on in chemical in that part of your business or do you just not have the type of mix that you want or exposure to the chemical industry for your Protective business?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, it's a little bit of both, we've had success in oil and gas in areas that are not investing right now and we're still growing market share in some of those areas. Even with the decline, we're still fighting and growing we believe share in a very challenging market, but to your point and it's the point that I try to make earlier, there are still areas for us \u2013 there are opportunities in the space, you mentioned the chemical areas where there are our assets coming online. We're fighting for everyone of those projects.", "We know that the infrastructure is an area that eventually is going to have to be an area of focus for our country, and countries around the world, and we're furthering our penetration in those areas. So what I don't want to give is the impression that we're just sitting here waiting for the oil and gas market to fix itself, we're up there fighting in existing markets, in adjacent markets, and in new markets, and we believe that there is considerable amount of opportunity for us there, and we're determined to capture.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Great. Thanks for your help.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you, Nils.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)", "Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking the call. The antitrust regulatory environment you have been doing deals for a while now, have you noticed the change this year as you've gone through the Valspar deal?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No. I think they are doing their job, they are asking questions that are appropriate, and we're trying to be as responsive as we can. I think going into this, we knew the deal and the facts and feel confident that the facts will carry the day, but we've got a government agency that is empowered to look at these things, and challenge, and they're doing just that, and we're trying to be as responsive as we can.", "Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)", "All right. And then a quick question, inventory was up, are you carrying more volume of inventory due to the slowdown here, and on the back of that, you typically won promotions in through October at your Paint Stores?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I'll address the inventory and our working capital was up slightly in the \u2013 through September. The way we look at it as a reminder, we target a 10% of sales, our working capital last year came in at 8.6%, we expect this year to come in around 10%. So, I don't believe we're carrying more inventory than we should be.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And we do occasionally run promotion in October.", "Chris Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)", "All right. Thank you, guys.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I was pretty late in the call. So, one on same-store sales in resi-repaint for professional. So, just in the home sales, it looks like they were basically flat or down year-on-year compared to the third quarter of 2015, but you guys saw a high-single digits in the professional segment there. Do you think that \u2013 I guess, would you attribute this to as a stronger business model? I know that we obviously saw weakness in DIY, but I'm trying to get a sense of why the professional segment was so strong?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, we've had a team that's been focused on that segment for many years, and it goes back to the comment that I made earlier about our commitment to providing the products, then services, locations, the people that will help us differentiate us from our competition. And we're blessed with good competition out there. So, we're not satisfied, we're not complacent. We're not sitting here feeling as though we've got it all figured out, we're trying to get better every day.", "And with our direct model, which is unique and the ability to really partner with our customers in understanding what their needs are and sometimes satisfying needs that they don't even know exist, has allowed us we believe to grow a little faster than the market. And we're committed to doing the things that can help differentiate us from our competition by allowing our customers to be more successful and what they're trying to do.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And, David, while you're right that existing home turnover does drive residential retain activity, remodeling activity in total year-to-date is up pretty substantially, it's up more than \u2013 it's up almost 6% in spending year-on-year. So, in the absence of a lot of growth in existing home turnover, we've seen growth in remodeling activity.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And one last thing I would add is the point that Bob made earlier, which is the shift to more and more contractor base, I think \u2013 we have to acknowledge that there is a shift going on to the contractor and we happen to be positioned very well for that contractor, but I also believe that's helping us as well.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Fine, great. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good afternoon, everyone and congratulations to both, Sean and Al.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hey.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you. Thank you, Chuck.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "We've talked of the contractors, you've mentioned this labor shortage, John, and I think it's even of impact as how aggressive they want to be on bidding at this point, does that board well for projects going into next year once the paint season gets underway, we're coming into some tougher weather now seasonally. So, what are your thoughts on that?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think it does, Chuck. I think it's \u2013 and that's the point that I made, I know I keep beating the same drum, but it's what gives us confidence about the model in 2017 and our ability to continue to drive operating margins going forward. You're exactly right.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And looking at the Consumer Group, and Sean or Al you might want to address this one, the margins were up on lower sales. Does some of that reflect what went on last year with the load into Lowe's and introductory promotional spending?", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, I think the spending has been pretty consistent in it. It's like we talked about in the second quarter, it was may be different programs, but with the \u2013 around the other hedges of SG&A that they did a nice job of controlling their costs and we talked about the mix in that business that helped, so I think that's what's driving the margin.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right. Thank you. Oh! You know, and obviously at the end of the call, I got cut off somehow for a bit. And I think, I joined just as you were explaining that reclassification, if now is a good time to just quickly explain that it would be great, otherwise I'll catch you offline?", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Chuck, we use third-party contractors and they do a variety of things for our customers, these previously immaterial amounts (79:37) SG&A, we determine that the billings to the customers should've been grossed up in sales with the payments for the contractors included in cost of goods sold in it, for net immaterial impact on gross profit. It does reduce our gross margin, and it does decrease our operating margin. And what we've talked about is, we did it prospectively in the third quarter, so we only booked it for the third quarter, we'll do that in the fourth quarter that I'll have a similar small impact, and then in the first quarter and second quarters of 2017. So 2017 full-year won't have any impact.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Sean P. Hennessy - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "You're welcome.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Chuck.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears, we have no further questions at this time. So, I'd like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you, Jesse. As always, I'll be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. As call volume is already very heavy, I appreciate your patience, I will make every effort to get back to you on a timely basis.", "I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Good morning, everyone. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, www.sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, January 26 Press Release. Beginning with our fourth quarter, consolidated sales increased $178 million or 6.8% to $2.78 billion due primarily to higher paint sales volumes through our paint stores and the impact of a change in revenue classification related to third-party service revenue and related costs.", "For the full year, consolidated sales increased $516.3 million or 4.6% to $11.86 billion. The change in revenue classification increased sales 2.2% in the fourth quarter and 1.1% for full year 2016. Unfavorable currency translation decreased consolidated net sales 0.9% in the quarter, and 1.4% for the full year.", "Consolidated gross profit in the fourth quarter increased $66.2 million or 5% to $1.38 billion. Gross profit for the year increased $363 million or 6.5% to $5.92 billion. Consolidated gross margin in the fourth quarter was 49.9% compared to 50.8% in the same period last year. Adjusting for the change in revenue classification, comparable gross margin in the fourth quarter would be approximately 51%. For the year, consolidated gross margin increased to 50% from 49% last year. Again, adjusting for the revenue reclassification, full year gross margin would be 50.4%.", "Selling, general and administrative expense increased $53.5 million or 5.4% to $1.04 billion in the fourth quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 37.6% from 38.1% in the same period last year. For the full year SG&A expense increased $246 million or 6.3% to $4.16 billion, an increase as a percent of sales to 35.1% from 34.5% in 2015. Without the change in revenue classification, SG&A as a percent of sales was 38.2% in the quarter and 35.4% for the year. SG&A in both the quarter and full year included acquisition-related expenses totaling $9.2 million and $58.4 million, respectively.", "Interest expense for the quarter increased $23.8 million to $43.3 million. For the year, interest expense increased $92.3 million to $154.1 million. The majority of this increase was acquisition-related interest expense. Consolidated profit before tax in the quarter increased $6.8 million or 2.3% to $304 million, which included approximately $34.5 million in acquisition-related expenses.", "For the full year, consolidated profit before tax increased $46.3 million or 3% to $1.6 billion, including approximately $133.6 million in acquisition-related expenses. Unfavorable currency translation reduced profit before tax $4.1 million in the quarter and $21.3 million for full year compared to 2015.", "Our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter decreased to 33.2% from 33.4% last year and decreased to 29% for the full year compared to 32% in 2015.", "Comparable effective tax rate, excluding the effect of the reduction in the income tax provision, would be 34.8% in the quarter and 32.3% for full year. Diluted net income per common share for the fourth quarter increased 1.9% to $2.15 per share from $2.11 per share last year. The $2.15 included $0.03 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.22 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.", "Diluted net income per common share for 2016 increased 7.5% to $11.99 per share from $11.15 per share in 2015. The $11.99 includes $0.40 accretion from the change in accounting standard and $0.86 dilution from acquisition-related expenses.", "Unfavorable currency translation decreased earnings per share by $0.03 per share in the quarter and $0.14 for the full year. Our results in the quarter and full year includes individually-significant non-operating items consisting of environmental expense, a gain on the sale of assets and goodwill and trademark impairment charges. The net after-tax impact of these items increased diluted earnings per share approximately $0.03 in the quarter and had no effect on earnings per share for the full year.", "Let me take a few minutes now to break down our performance by segment. Sales for our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter increased $163.5 million, or 9.8%, to $1.84 billion. For the year, net sales increased 8.1% to $7.79 billion. Comparable store sales, sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 5.5% in the quarter and 5.3% in the year. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due primarily to higher architectural paint sales volume across all customer segments, plus the impact of the change in revenue classification. The change in revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales.", "Regionally in the fourth quarter, our Southeastern division led all divisions, followed by Canada, Southwest division, Midwestern division and Eastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.", "Fourth quarter segment profit increased $25.7 million, or 8.1%, to $341.9 million due primarily to higher year-over-year paint sales volumes. For the full year, profit increased $189.1 million, or 13.2%, to $1.62 billion. The increase in segment profit for the year resulted from higher paint sales volumes that were partially offset by higher SG&A expenses. Excluding the change in revenue classification, segment operating margin for the fourth quarter increased 30 basis points to 19.2% from 18.9% last year. Paint Stores Group operating margin for full year 2016 excluding the revenue reclassification increased 130 basis points to 21.2% from 19.9% last year.", "Turning now to the Consumer Group. Fourth quarter external net sales increased $1.3 million or 0.4% to $315.9 million. For the year, Consumer Group sales increased $6.4 million, also 0.4% to $1.58 billion. In both the quarter and full year, higher volume sales to most of our Consumer Group's retail accounts was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation that decreased net sales 1.3% in the quarter and 1.1% in the year.", "Segment profit for our Consumer Group in the fourth quarter increased $4 million or 8% to $54.9 million. For the year, segment profit increased $10.4 million or 3.3% to $319.2 million. Segment profit as a percent of net sales for the quarter increased to 17.4% from 16.2% last year.", "For the year, segment operating margin increased to 20.1% from 19.6% last year. Most of the improvement in both fourth quarter and full-year segment profit margin was from volume-driven operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control.", "For our Global Finishes Group, fourth quarter net sales in US dollars were flat to last year, at $455 million. Full year sales decreased 1.4% to $1.89 billion.", "Unfavorable currency translation decreased sales in US dollars by 1.7% in the quarter and 2.6% in the year. Stated in US dollars, Global Finishes Group segment profit in the fourth quarter increased $11.4 million or 22.6% to $62 million from $50.6 million last year.", "For the full-year, segment profit increased $37.1 million or 18.4% to $239 million, due primarily to good expense control and lower raw material costs that were partially offset by unfavorable currency translation. Unfavorable currency reduced segment profit $800,000 in the quarter and $5.8 million in the year.", "As a percent of net sales, segment profit improved to 13.6% in the fourth quarter compared to 11.1% in the fourth quarter last year. Operating margin for the year increased to 12.7% compared to 10.5% in 2015.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, net sales in the quarter increased $13.1 million or 8.3% to $171.8 million. Full-year net sales decreased $44.1 million or 7% to $586.9 million, due primarily to unfavorable currency translation and lower volume sales, partially offset by higher year-over-year selling prices.", "Currency translation decreased sales in U.S. dollars by 6.7% in the quarter and 13.5% in the year. Stated in U.S. dollars, Latin America Coatings Group recorded a loss of $7.8 million in the quarter compared to a profit of $2.8 million last year.", "For the year, Latin America Coatings Group reported a loss of $17.4 million compared to a profit of $18.5 million in 2015. Segment profit in both the quarter and year was adversely affected by goodwill and trademark impairment charge of $10.7 million, increasing raw material costs and unfavorable currency translation that were all partially offset by selling price increases.", "Unfavorable currency decreased segment profit $3.2 million in the quarter and $14.2 million in the full year. As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit was negative 4.5% in the quarter compared to a profit of 1.8% last year and negative 3% for the full year compared to a profit of 2.9% in 2015.", "That concludes our review of our operating results for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. So, let me turn the call over to John Morikis, who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for 2017. John?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. 2016 was a momentous year for Sherwin-Williams. Against the backdrop of our 150th year in business, we transitioned the role of Chief Executive Officer at the beginning of the year and put plans in place to transition our Chief Financial Officer role at year end. In March, we announced our intent to acquire Valspar, the largest, most transformational acquisition in our company's history. And throughout the year, we worked to secure regulatory approval for the deal and to define what this new combined organization would like post integration. With change comes uncertainty and in financial markets, uncertainty often leads to volatility.", "2016 was a volatile year for Sherwin-Williams' stock. We opened the year at $257 a share, saw a mid-year high of $312, and an inter-year low of $239. Some of the share price volatility was understandably caused by quarter-to-quarter volatility in our results, while some appeared to be driven by market speculation. Through all of the change, uncertainty, volatility and speculation, our confidence in our business model, our strategy and the ability of our people to execute at a high-level and generate high returns never wavered.", "Our full-year results for 2016 include expenses related to the Valspar acquisition, and two accounting changes adopted during the year that affected our revenues and tax rate. If you back out the impact of these items, our core results for the year met or exceeded every expectation we set back in January. Consolidated sales increased 3.5% to $11.72 billion. Consolidated gross margin was 50.5%, an increase of 150 basis points over full-year 2015. Operating profit improved 10.8% to $1.82 billion. Profit before tax grew 11.6% to $1.73 billion, an increase of more than 100 basis points as a percent of sales. EBITDA eclipsed $2 billion for the first time in our history. Net income increased 11% to $1.17 billion. And earnings per share increased 11.7% to $12.45 per share; noteworthy, considering our full-year EPS last year included $0.53 in favorable LIFO inventory adjustments, while LIFO was slightly unfavorable in 2016. Each of these results represent a new record high for the company.", "Architectural paint sales to our paint stores picked up momentum in the fourth quarter with every customer segment generating positive volumes. Not surprisingly, the tightness in the labor market appears to be less acute in the seasonally smaller quarters. As a result, architectural paint sales to contractors accelerated to a high-single-digit growth rate in the quarter, aided by a backlog of projects from earlier in the year.", "Sales to residential repaint contractors rebounded to a double-digit growth rate, marking the 11th quarter of double-digit growth in the past 13 quarters. Sales of protective and marine coatings were negative in the quarter, but the impact on Paint Stores Group sales were muted due to seasonality.", "In the fourth quarter, Paint Stores Group's operating margin on incremental sales was greater than 24%, a strong performance in light of the roughly $30 million LIFO benefit they received in fourth quarter last year compared to a LIFO expense of $2 million in fourth quarter this year.", "During the quarter, we opened 39 net new stores, bringing our full year store opening total to 94 net new locations and our total store count at year-end to 4,180 stores in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean. We remain confident that our next milestone of 5,000 locations in North America is realistic, and we intend to add another 90 to 100 stores this year.", "We anticipated a stronger sales performance from Consumer Group coming into the fourth quarter. The weakness we experienced in the third quarter in our European business, due, in part, to currency devaluation, carried over into the fourth quarter. Despite the weaker than expected sales results, Consumer Group continued to manage operating expenses well and showed good progress on margins in the quarter.", "For the second consecutive quarter, Latin America Coatings Group reported positive revenue growth, as stronger volumes and positive pricing overcame a currency headwind of nearly 7% in the quarter. Segment profit also showed improvement, overcoming rising raw material costs and the effect of currency devaluation. Without the $10.7 million goodwill impairment in the quarter, the segment earned $2.9 million in profit for the quarter.", "Our Global Finishes Group once again did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A in the quarter, resulting in a cycle-high 13.6% operating margin, a 250 basis point improvement compared to fourth quarter last year. We continue to see positive demand momentum in some of our industrial coatings businesses in Europe and Asia.", "2016 was another strong year in terms of cash generation. Net operating cash for the year was $1.31 billion, well ahead of our target of 10% of net sales, with fourth quarter accounting for about $344 million of the total. Net working capital was a use of cash, finishing the year at 10.7% of sales compared to 8.6% at year-end 2015. Free cash flow, which is net operating cash less CapEx and dividends, was $757.5 million compared to $953.5 million (22:11) last year.", "Our capital expenditures for the year totaled $239 million. Depreciation was $172.1 million, and amortization was $25.6 million. In 2017, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $231 million, depreciation of $175 million to $185 million, and amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will continue to run higher than normal in 2017 as we continue to invest in capacity, systems and new stores.", "Our cash balance at the close of 2016 was $889.8 million compared to $205.7 million at year-end 2015. As we indicated when we announced the Valspar acquisition, we intend to continue to build cash on our balance sheet over the course of the coming year to reduce total borrowings required to finance the deal. Therefore, we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury during the quarter and year, and we'll suspend share repurchase activity again in 2017.", "On December 31, we had remaining authorization to acquire $11.65 million shares. We're also temporarily modifying our practice of paying 30% of prior year EPS in cash dividend. This year at our February meeting of the Board of Directors, we will recommend approval of an annual dividend of $3.40 per share, an increase of $0.04 over 2016.", "Before I close with our outlook for 2017, let me briefly comment on our Valspar acquisition progress. Based on our ongoing discussions with the FTC, we now expect a divestiture will be required to gain approval to complete the acquisition, and we are actively working toward that objective. The expected divestiture falls well below the $650 million revenue threshold and we expect to negotiate the divesture and complete the Valspar transaction within 90 days at a price of $113 per share.", "Looking ahead to 2017, the demands for paint and coatings in most domestic markets continues to look positive. Growth in residential starts and existing home turnover was sufficient to drive 2% to 3% growth in US architectural industry volume throughout 2016, and the outlook for 2017 is comparable. Although contracts for new, non-residential projects slowed somewhat in 2016. It was still a solid year in absolute square footage, which bodes well for the paint demand in the segment.", "Outside the US, we are increasingly optimistic on demand conditions across many regions, but we remain cautious in our outlook on many currencies. Our raw material basket has many moving parts, but, in total, we believe, we are likely to see higher year-over-year input costs in 2017. The recent uptick in the price of crude oil could result in upward pressure on the petrochemical side of the raw material basket, but these commodities will not necessarily move in a linear relationship with crude.", "Most of the raw material basket inflation will come from TiO2. Stronger, global demand for high-grade chloride TiO2, and relatively tight inventory level has prompted most producers to announce additional price increases effective in the first and second quarters of 2017. It remains to be seen how much, if any, of these increases will actually take effect. Based on all of these factors, we expect average year-over-year raw material cost for the paint and coatings industry to be up in the low-single digits range in 2017.", "Our outlook for the first quarter 2017 is for consolidated net sales to increase in the mid- to high-single-digit percentage range compared to last year's first quarter. With sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share in the first quarter will be in the range of $1.45 to $1.55 per share compared to a restated $1.75 per share earned in the first quarter of 2016.", "First quarter 2017 earnings guidance includes approximately $0.69 per share in Valspar acquisition cost, and an $0.11 increase in EPS related to the decrease in the income tax provision. As a reminder, first quarter 2016 earnings per share included $0.24 expense related to the Valspar acquisition.", "For the full year 2017, we expect net sales will increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared to full year 2016. With annual sales at that level, we estimate diluted net income per common share for 2017 will be in the range of $13 to $13.20 per share compared to $11.99 in 2016.", "Full year 2017 earning guidance includes approximately $0.80 in Valspar acquisition cost and an increase in EPS of approximately $0.20 per share related to the decrease in the income tax provision. Full year 2016 earnings per share included $0.86 per share in acquisition-related expense, partially offset by a $0.40 EPS increase from the reduction in income tax provision.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning. And, now, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. Thank you. I guess I just wanted to understand some of the guidance commentary for 2017. Maybe you can help me understand the mid-single-digit sales commentary, how that breaks out between maybe your volume expectations and your price given that you do have a price initiative that you announced on the last call and potentially new stores and the revenue recognition as well. Thank you.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hi, Arun. This is Allen Mistysyn. When you look at our full year sales guidance, the price we have in there, as you know, Paint Stores Group announced the 3% to 5% price increase effective December 1. We expect that to be effective similar to previous price increases, maybe even a little bit better considering the last price increase we had was first quarter 2014. So, you can expect around a 75% effectiveness there.", "When you look at volume, Paint Stores Group continues to take share, we believe, and we expect \u2013 you can expect our sales to roll out similar to how our 2016 sales rolled out. And what I mean by that is when we say mid-single digit, typically our Paint Stores Group is in the high end of that or maybe even a little above that.", "New stores, as John mentioned in his comment, being 90 to 100. You can consider that similar impact as 2016, which is roughly 1% on Paint Stores. And then one other thing I would say, on revenue reclass, because we had a half year revenue reclass in 2016 and the impact was around 1%, full year 2017 we'd have a similar impact. And then the final thing I would mention on our sales guidance is we do still believe FX will be a headwind but just not to the effect it was in 2016.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks, Al. And just as a follow up, you've also given a range for Q1. I think there's some concerns out there just given that you are facing a pretty large comp year-over-year, given that you did 9.4% in same-store sales in Q1 of 2016. Can you just describe kind of the market environment and what's embedded in your sales guidance? Do you expect a positive comp in Q1, and if so, what gives you the confidence that you could achieve that? Thank you.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. Arun, I'd say what gives us the confidence is the continued discussions that we have with our customers and we've talked about over the last couple of quarters the impact of the labor constraints on our contractors, and I've referenced a few times the comments that we have continuously heard about their ability to do more work if they had more labor. And I think it's clear now to see that that's most prevalent in the second and third quarter which are their busiest quarters. So, they were running at capacity.", "So, coming into the fourth quarter with less labor constraint and a heavy backlog of work, they clearly had a better performance and we expect that to continue as we go into the first quarter. And we're working very hard as always to continue to position ourselves to be the supplier of choice when they're making their decision on which supplier.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Also, as a reminder, the revenue reclassification hits stores the greatest and they will have that in the first and second quarter.", "Arun Viswanathan - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Right. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Arun.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. This is actually Matt Krueger sitting in for Ghansham. How are you doing today?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hey, Matt.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Great. How are you?", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Good. Good. Can you provide the same-store sales breakdown for 4Q 2016 in terms of volumes for architectural paint, volumes for non-paint end markets and then any contribution from the price increase?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. Yes, Matt. So, when you look at the sales increase in the fourth quarter, it's really minimally impacted by the price increase as December is our smallest month in that quarter.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. I would say that if you look at the effective day, the first of December roll in the smallest month, and as Al mentioned, we're rolling this in. So, we expect to have good effectiveness in the rollout of the price increase, but it would certainly have been negligible in the fourth quarter.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great. And then any breakdown between volumes for the non-paint end markets versus volumes for the architectural paint? Any turn in oil and gas related markets, things like that?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "John, I'll take the non-paint sales. We feel they performed fairly well throughout the year. We saw \u2013 we did see an uptick in the fourth quarter similar to what we saw in our volumes. But I think overall, we're pretty happy with the performance of the non-paint sales, which includes, by the way, spray equipment.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Right. And on the P&M, Protective & Marine side, it continues to be a drag. Obviously, much less of a drag as we go into more seasonal period. But that's largely driven by our strong position in our petrochem. We're continuing to focus on that business. There's still a lot of opportunity for us to grow, but we're also working, I think, quite well given the efforts on the team pivoting to other segments.", "So, we're not waiting for that segment, the petrochem, to recover as a means of driving our performance. We're working very hard in these adjacent markets, other segments, and we're really starting to see some good penetration there. It takes some time before we can over that petrochem number though.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Got it. And then switching over to the acquisition front. How should we think about the divested Valspar assets as it relates to impacting the synergy numbers that you previously outlined when the transaction was announced?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, we're obviously very limited in what we can comment on regarding this. We're very pleased with the progress we're making. The business that to be divested has been identified and we're working through the FTC with that, to that process. But we're really not going to expand to much greater than that right now. We mentioned that it's well below the $650 million. But right, now we're working closely and, I think, quite well with the FTC, and we want to make sure that we respect the boundaries there.", "Matthew T. Krueger - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great. That's helpful. Thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you. As we hit further into 2017 and in the context of recent housing and mortgage apps data, can you just give us a sense on the general composition and parse out the various buckets of R&R activity, and how you think this should flow into the architectural volumes of both PSG and consumer and, I guess, consequently guidance? And then also, do you have any kind of updated assumptions on labor availability as we head throughout the year? Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, Chris, this is Bob. I'll take the first half of that, and that is our outlook for the repaint market, on both the residential and commercial side, is very positive for 2017. On the residential side, obviously, existing home turnover drives repaint activity but only about 15% to 20% of the market is driven by actual turnover, and a significant share of the market is driven by home values which, obviously, have been very positive.", "I just read this morning, 58 consecutive months of rising home prices. So, that is certainly driving the repaint and remodeling side of the market. We expect mid-single digit to high-single digit growth in the repaint/remodel side of the market in the coming year. And as a reminder, that's 80% of residential industry gallon volume. So, it's a significant piece of the market, and we expect very good momentum in that piece.", "On the non-residential side, we are seeing some pickup in property management, property maintenance activity. It's very likely, as we see more churn in office space and apartment, that we'll see that pickup but you've got to see more churn. Churn has been slow in 2015 and 2016.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Regarding labor, I would say that this has not been the second consecutive year where our contractors has faced a challenging, if you will, Q2 and Q3 as it relates to labor. And we've been talking to them, and I do actually believe their confidence in the market is pushing them to be more aggressive in hiring additional labor. And I think there have been some questions as the business has unfolded about the stability or the firmness of the market and I think there's obviously a very growing level of confidence. And I think we'll see our customers be far more active and trying to bring more labor on as we go into the painting season this year.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Great. And just a quick follow-up on PSG as it pertains to the price increases. I think most people's understanding that obviously we'll start off in the DIY crowd and some shorter term contractors. Can you just give a little more guidance on kind of the cadence of how you think they will flow through PSG results based on the breakdown of sales? Thank you.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Chris, if you think about past price increases, what you'll typically see and we'll see that again is a slight downtick in our gross margin. And then, as the effectiveness becomes \u2013 as we come more effective through our customers in 90 days, 180 days, you'll start seeing that turnaround and that's what I would expect in this price increase as well.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "But I'd also add that the effectiveness is going to be a little bit stronger. Given the rate of growth in our residential repaint business, there are some opportunities with mix to offset some of that as well. So, we actually have very good confidence in the fact and, again, over repeating it here, but we've not had a price increase since the first quarter of 2014. The phase-in will be mixed based on customer, type of customer, types of projects, but we're out there working hard.", "You don't do a price increase on December 1. It's actually we work with our customers around the year providing those solutions to them that help them be more productive in their business. And so, if we're more successful in helping them, then it's a better discussion, and that's what we've been working on for many years here.", "Christopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Great substance. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes. John, you mentioned there's backlog of projects kind of came forward in the fourth quarter. Would you say that that drove a mix shift towards the pro market versus DIY and did you gain share from the other channels, would you say, in the PSG Group?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, I think it's early to comment on gaining shares from other channels. I'd say, given information that's out available in the market right now, we're feeling good about the momentum we have. It's certainly not complacent. I mean, we're driven to get better every day. But I would say that there's clearly been some shift from DIY to the contractor-based business, if that was your question.", "But I'd also say that, as I mentioned, there's clearly been more demand than there was labor to be able to satisfy that, and that clearly shifted into the fourth quarter.", "Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just on that last point, are your pro-contractor customers telling you that they just needed to be more aggressive in hiring or is it actually difficulty in finding that labor pool?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think it's a little bit of both. I think it's a little bit of both. There was a level of confidence that, I think, the teams that we're getting \u2013 we've gotten over the hill on, but there clearly is a demand or desire to hire more than what they've been successful in hiring thus far.", "Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, everybody. This is Chris Evans on for Bob.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hi, Chris.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Just, regarding the DIY consumer, just kind of curious if the weaker results are sort of across the industry and the third quarter continued in the fourth and whether that was reflected in Paint Stores Group and Consumer?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "We actually had a nice rebound in the fourth quarter DIY. So, our sales were up in the fourth quarter, not quite as high as our \u2013 some of our contractor segments. We had really, really strong double-digit gains in res repaint. The other segments in the wholesale were strong and DIY would have been amongst them.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got you. And then I guess in regards to your guidance for 2017, you talk about some of the pros, some of the positive that you're going to be impacted by the pricing and kind of the market share gains. What are the offsets that might be impacting you in 2017 that you guys will be concerned about?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I wouldn't say we're concerned. I think when you look at the last two years on how our comp store sales have trended, our biggest quarters are still on second and third quarter. Although we're working hard on programs and plans with our customers to get on top of that in the second and third quarters, it still remains to be seen how effective that is and if there's other changes that occur, whether it's immigration policy or whatever that might impact us. So, that would be the only thing that would give us any pause.", "Christopher Evans - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Good morning, fellows.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hi, Duffy.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hi, Duffy.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "A question around with the deal feeling imminent, have you guys been able to narrow what you think the range will be between kind of a GAAP accretion and a cash accretion with the deal, so basically what's the step up going to be in that increased amortization? And then, along those same lines, are you planning to talk about a cash EPS or will you talk about a GAAP EPS once the deal closes and goes forward?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "We have not gotten to a narrowed-down range on the impact of the valuation. And I think, Duffy, we would make sure that it's clear. We'd give you enough information and the investors enough information to get to a cash EPS, so what the incremental impact on amortization/depreciation of the step-up accounting is, and we want to be as transparent as we can of that.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then, one of the arguments for architectural being so good is the argument around the footprint and it's very hard to come in without an existing base. But we did see an Asian competitor, kind of a non-incumbent in North America, buy a North American competitor here recently. Wondering if you could just comment on why that might be that they were able to do that? And with deeper pockets, would that North American base now provide the ability for them to grow more into the architectural space?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, I'd say that Dunn-Edwards is a terrific company and one that we have long admired. And the reason we've admired them for such a long time is they've got quality products, quality people and a terrific, as you mentioned, footprint. They've been very good competitors. And I don't expect that any of our people on the ground there ever took Dunn-Edwards as a light competitor or someone that you didn't have to be very careful of and work hard to try to grow our business and maintain the business that we had.", "So, yeah, we respect that there's another competitor in the market. But we've got great confidence in our model. We've got great confidence in our strategy. And we have found that the greatest success we have is when we focus on our execution. And they've always been a good competitor out there. We expect they'll continue to be a good competitor. But while we'll watch what they do, we're going to be really focused on outstanding execution of our strategy.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And let me add to that, Duffy, that your point about the store base or the store concentration is well taken. But as you know from our business, it doesn't require a lot of capital to expand a store base. So, we don't view a competitor like Dunn-Edwards as ever having been capital constrained in their ability to grow their store count, so we don't necessarily see this new owner as being a tougher competitor from that regard.", "Duffy Fischer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Terrific. Thanks, fellas.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Duffy.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Yes. Thank you. John, as you've had time to meet with your Valspar counterparts, to the extent you can and you've gone over synergy targets, how are you feeling about that $280 million in synergies because, again, it struck me that particularly on logistics and manufacturing, that you were somewhat conservative on your outlook for synergies.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, we feel great about them. We're not going to raise them here. I mean, we're still working through a number of blueprinting and kind of our approach to the combined business. We feel very good about them. We're excited about it, wonderful people, wonderful products, great customers. There's great complement to our business. We're very excited. But right now, that's our target. And as we get in it, to Al's point, transparency is important. We understand that. But right now, that's our goal, that's where we're focused on.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "I had a follow-up on PSG. You've got one price increase on the table. If you do see some of the second round, if you had two price increases, if oil continues to go up, what are the conditions that would cause you to put through a second price increase later on in the year?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think you should take great confidence in our previous actions when \u2013 we don't think that we're in a similar environment, but in the not too distant past here when raws were really, I'll call it, out of control, they were growing very aggressively, and we demonstrated the discipline we have to go out and put price increases in the market, not by choice, but given the ability that we have to continue to bring value to our customers and help them, we were successful in doing that.", "And we don't think it's anywhere near that situation here in the current environment, but if we found ourselves in that environment, I think we've demonstrated the determination to do that and, at the same time, our ability to demonstrate the value to our customers to maintain those customers through that difficult time.", "Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Don.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. This is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I'm just curious how you think about the quarterly cadence of the expected low-single-digit increase in 2017 raw material costs. And specifically, will the headwind be any more announced in the first quarter than the balance of the year given the comp against the trough TiO2 environment?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. Good question, Matt. Because \u2013 I think it depends on what happens to the price increases in TiO2 nominated for the first and second quarter. If you look back at 2016, first quarter was the trough. So, we started seeing TiO2 inflate beginning in the second quarter, which means that the history is going to start to rise as we go through 2017. It remains to be seen whether TiO2 inflation rises at the same pace as the comp or stronger or less.", "At this point, we think that most of the low-single-digit inflation for 2017 year-over-year is going to be driven by TiO2. We suspect given inventory levels right now and the fact that fourth quarter was actually a pretty busy quarter for them, that they're going to get likely a little traction on the price increases that they've nominated. But again, that remains to be seen. And I think you can model raw material costs at a low-single-digit rate pretty much across all four quarters.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then on SG&A, what are your expectations there in terms of the promotional environment perhaps moderating on a year-over-year basis, 2017 versus 2016?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think if you look at our guidance and think about with the raw material price increases in that \u2013 let me frame it this way. Our improvement in operating margin is not going to come from as big a gross margin improvement as we've seen over the last few years. So when you look at SG&A, we're going to get SG&A leverage to hit that EPS guidance. And we set ourselves up, I think, fairly well. We did some things in the fourth quarter to get us in a position to do that. You saw that in our leverage we got in our SG&A on the fourth quarter. And I don't think the environment, promotional activity or that will be any different...", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No. That won't be affected. I mean, we're going to continue to do the right things to reach out to our customers. But to Al's point, we clearly try to remain disciplined in our approach to SG&A. So, we'll be managing the SG&A and continuing to reach out to our customers.", "Matthew Gingrich - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks, guys.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.", "Hello, everyone. It's Matt DeYoe on for Kevin.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hi, Matt.", "Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.", "Just wanted to ask, Paint Store contribution margins look to have moved higher sequentially, but we're kind of still below that mid-30% range that I've kind of think is more normal. I know part of that's probably due to revenue reclassifications, but can you kind of discuss what's needed to turn that back around and when do you anticipate getting back to those prior mid-30% levels.", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Matt, what I would point you to is we felt very good about Paint Stores Group year and they had a strong year. When you look at their incremental margin ex the rev reclass, it was 42% for the year, and that came through primarily gross margin expansion. In the quarter, it was a little bit over 24%. And as John commented in his opening remarks, that did include a LIFO benefit in our fourth quarter last year as a comparison. We didn't have that same benefit this year. So, I think the 42% is probably higher than we would expect going forward but certainly in line with where we would expect.", "Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.", "Okay. And then you touched briefly on this, but just one more on the Protective & Marine business. When do you kind of expect that business should flatten out first, I guess, and then return to growth just given the rebound we're seeing in activity?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. We are starting to see some rebound, you're right, and that combined with the pivoting into other areas that I'd mentioned, we have high expectations of that team. And so when do we expect to see it, it can't come soon enough. We're pushing hard and we're counting on that team to deliver. So, we're working on that very hard right now.", "Matthew DeYoe - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Matt.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nils Wallin with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Yes. Good morning. And thanks for taking my question. First of all is on TiO2 but little differently. Have you thought over the next two years about your sourcing requirements and how you might change those if there was a border tax adjustment and it raised the cost of imported TiO2?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah, Nils. I think and I'm not sure how much high-grade chloride TiO2 that is sold in the United States is produced in the United States. I do believe the vast majority of our sources are domestic. I think that may not be the same in the case of sulfate TiO2. I think a lot of that is imported. But chloride, we see sufficient capacity in the U.S. market to supply U.S. demand at the current growth rate. And growth rates in 2016 in the domestic market were probably mid-single digits, and we think that supply can grow in line with that rate of demand growth.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Understood. And just on the Consumer Group, I think the commentary was that you saw a volume growth in all the different distribution channels, but that seems, particularly in the big box, seems to be a little bit dissident with what you've seen reported out of the big boxes. So, was the volume growth relatively the same across those distribution channels or how would you characterize the different channels in terms of that growth rate in consumer?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I'd say that they were very similar. We, as mentioned, had a good fourth quarter in paint. The pressure that we felt was outside of the U.S., mainly the UK stain and sealer business. So, across most of our channels here in the U.S., I'd say we had a pretty good performance on paint on the consumer side.", "Nils-Bertil Wallin - CLSA Americas LLC", "Thanks. I'll pass it along.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Nils.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Hi. Good morning. Question on the Global Finishes. I think 12% to 13% or maybe 11% to 12% was kind of the prior goal that, John, you guys have communicated at an Analyst Day fairly recently. You guys are there and it hasn't come with a lot of volume growth. So, how should we think about that business going forward now that it's not really that small piece of the portfolio anymore?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, you're right, and for the past two years, the group had benefited from the successful integration of those two acquisitions that we made in Europe, the Becker and Sayerlack, as well as the acquisition that we made in Asia, Inchem. And both of those acquisitions brought along scale, technology, and talent outside of the U.S. There's a team has really been working hard at driving the synergies in those acquisitions. And by the way, it will be the same teams that are actively involved in the Valspar integration. So, they've been doing a very good job from an integration standpoint. And to your point, the focus is on driving sales and growing market share. And I actually felt very good about the momentum that we have in some markets. In Europe, we're doing quite well and in some of the segments in Asia.", "The scale effect that we've experienced will continue. This will also benefit greatly from Valspar as those businesses come together. We'll have additional technology and a customer base to pursue. So, while we're pleased, obviously, with the improvement on the bottom line, we also know that it's absolutely critical that we drive the top line. So, the scale has helped. There's a lot of focus on growing market share going forward, and we've got confidence in that team and the ability to do that.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "And then maybe switching transitions to the domestic contractors business. Is there anything you guys can do to help alleviate shortage of contractors, whether that's from the trade school or \u2013 I know you guys are probably developing products that we don't hear about, but is there anything bigger picture, John, that you guys can help with and probably with all the other manufacturers itself what's viewed to be a broad base shortage?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, there are and we're working on it, but we don't want to talk about that.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Okay. And then maybe just lastly, I'll defer. Al, can you just give us a sense of what the tax rate will look like in 2017, maybe in 1Q in 2017, I guess, with the income tax benefit?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. I think when you look at our fourth quarter, we had some things in it, just the timing of discrete items and our full-year at 33% is consistent with prior. I think, our first quarter, the stock comp adjustment is our largest quarter. So, our core tax rate will be around the 32%, and you got to think about how that flowed this year and there'll be a few percentage points on that.", "Scott Rednor - Zelman & Associates", "Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Good morning, everyone, and congratulations.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Good morning, Chuck.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Nice finish to the year. Looking at this acquisition, you mentioned with the cash you had at the end of the year that you're going to apply to funding it. What can you tell us at this point perhaps what the initial debt load-in might be and might that be offset by some short-term investments that aren't included in your cash balance at the end of the year?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "So, on the debt, certainly our cash ended a little bit better than we thought it would. We had a strong cash quarter. The debt that we'll issue similar to what we've been talking about, Chuck, we would \u2013 any proceeds we get from the divestiture would go towards the reduction of that debt. And, I think, as you know, we had the treasury lock rates in place. We'll issue the debt as we get closer to closing of the acquisition. And I think, like I said, I think we'll be around that same number we've been talking about.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then if we look at the -- how should we think about the tax rate going forward? You're backing out the benefit of the accounting change. What would you offer as the underlying run rate for Sherwin's taxes?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "On the core tax rate, it'll be around the 32% that we've been running the last few years with...", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "32%?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, sir. 32%. Looking forward, Valspar has a much bigger presence outside the U.S. and as you would expect, that should be lower on the weighted of the two.", "Charles Cerankosky - Northcoast Research Partners LLC", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Chuck.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Well, thank you. Good morning, guys. John, you all sound pretty skeptical on the TiO2 additional pricing going through. Just wondered what your thoughts were on why at least sound that way that it probably won't. And then, if we could talk on the consumer DIY, what's the promotional environment you're seeing there that the fourth quarter picked up? And would your pricing through the Paint Stores have any halo effect at all through the retail channel?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes, Stephen. This is Bob. On the TiO2 issue, they kind of had a perfect storm at the end of the year. They were running mid-single-digit growth kind of throughout the year. And then at yearend, you saw our volumes in the fourth quarter, they had kind of a spike in demand that did not allow them to build inventory at the rate they normally would coming into 2017.", "So, there are strained inventory levels and that will keep utilization rates high and inventory levels fairly low going through the first two quarters, because those are the strong-demand quarters. And those are actually favorable market conditions for them.", "However, we think there's ample capacity in the market. So, the offset to that and to that kind of good environment for them, is that they're going to raise their operating rates. And if demand coming out of the gates is not robust in 2017, it's very likely that the pricing that they've announced for the first two quarters is going to, at least, break to some degree, if not entirely.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And, Stephen, could you clarify for me, I want to make sure I understood your question on consumer fourth quarter and the halo effect. Can you help me understand your question?", "Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Yeah. Sorry, John. Just combining those a little bit. You had a better consumer segment DIY channel in the fourth quarter. I was wanting to know, one, what was the promotional environment like. And then, as you all push through your price hikes in your Paint Stores, would you see any halo effect to allow any pricing on the retail side, on the DIY home centers, et cetera?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I don't see the halo effect on the store to the retail side. And on the consumer side \u2013 I'm sorry, on the promotional side, I don't think there was any significant shift at all on the consumer side. That team has been working very hard and we've been open about some of the traction that we've been gaining, kind of starting a little slower than what was expected and then over the last two years working to be able to more effective. And I think we're starting to see some of that traction pay off.", "Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, Latin America, just quickly, what was the trademark related to? And as you look at 2017, some of those of economies have started to recover. Are you all expecting volume gallonage growth in your forecast there?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "For the impairment, if you think about our Latin America Coatings Group, the high watermark in operating margin was about 10% in 2012. And over the past few years, they've been dealing with the economies that you talked about, the currency headwinds .An quite honestly, the sales and profit haven't been up to our expectations.", "With that, including 2016 and building off of that base, your sales and profit projections and the cash that it generates just didn't support the goodwill we had on the balance sheet. So, that's why we took the impairment.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. And to your question about going forward, I'd say we clearly see that the investments are starting to pay off that we've been making with improved volume, and even the pricing actions that we've been able to experience. While we expect economic conditions to improve there, we also expect that they'll be choppy from quarter to quarter. Our teams are really working hard down there to position themselves favorably in the market. And we've been really doing, I think, some heavy lifting down there.", "But all these comes back together to the point that I take away, not only just in Latin America, but across the entire company, where we're continuing to grow sales and market share across many of our businesses, Latin America included. I think we're demonstrating the ability to improve the mix by providing that superior solution to those customers and the discipline to offset the input cost inflation with pricing that's needed.", "And so when you are converting sales to profit like we are, we're improving our return on sales and focusing on cash, not only in Latin America but around the company. It gives us confidence, in Latin America, here in the U.S. and around the world.", "Stephen East - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Steve..", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ivan Marcuse with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just got a couple of quick ones. First, what's the change in gross profit for your consumer \u2013 for your Paint Stores Group and for Consumer Group?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "The change in gross profit for Paint Stores Group was $62 million and the gross profit change for Consumer was $2 million.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I was going to say, Ivan, the Latin America was $2.5 million and Global Finishes Group was $1.1 million. (01:07:39).", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then \u2013 thanks for that. If you were to, I guess, gauge the percentage of your volume that goes in infrastructure, they'd be all in the Protective & Marine or would there be other channels to think about in terms of if we see an increase of infrastructure going forward, how that would impact you?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "It would largely be in our Protective & Marine. You'd see some in our Product Finishes as well. We would have maybe fabricators that might be tucked in onto that business.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then Protective & Marine, that's roughly 15% of sales in terms of your Paint Stores Group?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Of Paint Stores Group, yes. But there's also a component in Latin America and a component in Global Finishes. But the domestic piece here, to your question, is Paint Stores Group.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks. And then my last question. In terms of the tax, if this \u2013 if we start to see the, I guess, tax rate being reduced at least in the U.S., I know the vast majority of your earnings come out of the U.S., would you appreciate a 10% reduction in the tax rate? Would that be \u2013 would we see a similar type of reduction in your overall tax rate or how should we think about the moving parts? And are your book taxes similar to your cash taxes?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I think with the stock comp change, our book and cash taxes are more similar. I would say on our current book of business that might be the case. To your point, about a 10% reduction in tax rates, does that correlate to a 10% reduction in ours, that may be the case today. But if you look forward with Valspar, we will get a bigger chunk of our profits from outside the U.S. and that's going to change things a little bit. So, we'll model that as we go forward but that's kind of where we're at.", "Ivan M. Marcuse - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I appreciate it.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Ivan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you. I wanted to come back to the foreign acquisition on the West Coast. I think it's true that there are no other foreign-owned significant architectural competitors in North America and maybe the only significant last two were Glidden and the Comex businesses that you ended up acquiring. So, I think, the history here is that we probably shouldn't worry about that all that much, but I wanted to just check if I had the facts right there.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I believe you're right on the past two owners. But I'd say we live a healthy life of concern, right? So, we don't want to take anything for granted. And so while there's a lot of competitors in the market right now, Dunn-Edwards has been a very good one in the past, we're not taking anything for granted. And they've done a terrific in the past. We expect that they'll continue to do a terrific job. And our job is to get better every day.", "John Roberts - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Robert J.

Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hey, Jacob.", "Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "I was just wondering, can we get an update on the Paint Shield product, where are you guys on the launch process and maybe how it's been tracking relative to expectations?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. I'd say that we continue to see this product in more and more test applications which is exciting for us. We've had a number of hospitals that are using the product and others that are testing it. What we're finding is that they \u2013 they, meaning our customers \u2013 want to put these through a validation process which we expected and that's what we're working through right now. So, we always want to sell more. So, while there's clearly momentum in the gallons that are going out, we want to continue to drive that at a faster rate. And that's what our teams are working on.", "Jacob Schowalter - Seaport Global Securities LLC", "Perfect. Thank you for answering my question.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC", "Good morning. This is Ben Shim on for Scott.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hi, Ben.", "Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Recently, you've been talking about, previously talked about what maybe a new seasonality in the third quarter, given the pent-up demand going to the fourth quarter and the strong volumes you guys had. Is there anything new that you've learned or seen from customers so far that could continue or alter that trend for 2017?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, there's a few things. As I mentioned, I believe that our customers have gotten a little more comfortable in growing what might be perceived initially as their fixed cost by adding incremental labor, number one.", "Number two, I believe the idea of product selection has become more important. And that actually benefits us. So, when we're introducing products of higher quality to our customers, they're able to be more productive on the job and we're benefiting from that. We're seeing a positive mix shift in the choice of gallons used by many of these customers because they recognize higher-quality product. Might cost them a bit more in a gallon of paint, but helps them tremendously, not only in their cost of labor, but speed of labor.", "And the last thing I would add is that we're working closely with many customer groups in continuing to innovate new products that will help them. In fact, this year, 2017, we're launching 17 new architectural products into our Stores Group on top of, I think, it was 23 last year, and I believe it was 25 the year before. And so it's been a tremendous driver in our pipeline of innovation as well to try to help our customers.", "Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay, great. Any thoughts on recent change in FTC leadership and how that might affect the timing of the Valspar acquisition? I'm assuming it doesn't change, but just wanted to see if you guys had any thoughts.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, I think you're right. I don't think it changes. I think we're proceeding quite well, we believe. And we're very respectful of whoever we're speaking to on the FTC side.", "Benedict Shim - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thanks so much.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. Thanks.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Ben.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Perrella with Bloomberg. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the call \u2013 questions. In Latin America, is there additional restructuring to be had? Have you right-sized that business in light of the impairment charges? And then overseas, in preparation for the Valspar acquisition, are there any steps you're taking before the deal closes to right-size locations?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "So, for Latin America, what I talked about with where we were at, at the high watermark and where we're at today, I think the team has taken all the steps as far as right-sizing the organization. We're continuously looking for opportunities to improve our SG&A and to extend our margins, whether that's through our factories, distribution or whatnot. But from just a reorganizational standpoint, I think we're where we want to be.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. We talk an awful lot about, Chris, the mindset of continuous improvement in our organization. There's not a finish line in that space. I mean, we're going to constantly be looking for those opportunities. And to your point about right-sizing in other parts of the world, as you heard when we were talking about our Global Finishes Group attacking the synergies between the two acquisitions that we've made, those have been many years in the progress, and we're still working very hard at that, and it's going to continue.", "So, I think you should expect us to continue to look for those but be very smart. At the same time, we're investing in other levers that can help us grow our business.", "Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)", "All right. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then on the petrochem end of the raw material basket, is there any lift that you have built into your guidance, maybe in the back half of the year, cost pressure there or is it just evenly flat across the board?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No, we are expecting mild inflation in the petrochemical side of the basket. You may have noticed that polypropylene pricing for January settled up quite a bit. We anticipated some upward pressure in propylene \u2013 I said polypropylene \u2013 it's actually propylene settled up quite a bit. That move came a little earlier than expected, but we believe it was primarily a function of higher propane demand for heating and propylene restocking, primarily amongst polypropylene customers. In our view, both of these factors are short term, and we are not convinced that the move in January is going to result in more petrochemical inflation than we anticipated in our initial forecast, which is relatively mild.", "Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)", "All right. And now, for housekeeping purpose, it takes about 90 days to work its way down the chain to you?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Give or take, yes, 90. Yes.", "Christopher Silvio Perrella - Bloomberg LP (Research)", "All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Thank you for your patience and actually getting to my question, guys. Congratulations on a great finish of the year.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Couple of questions leftover from all the ones that have been asked. First of all, just following up on the last question around Latin America, you put up about 15% growth, excluding FX. I understand it was mostly pricing. Is that correct? Your volume was still weaker year-over-year?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "No. That's incorrect. We had a volume increase in a number of our countries down there, the strongest being Mexico, and we had some good performance.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. So, I guess my next question on the pricing, was that actual sort of price increases to offset foreign exchange translations or was it sort of a price increase above and beyond to handle either raw materials or just mispricing in the market? Can you talk about some of the high pricing component of those revenues?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. But it was primarily related to the continued devaluation. If you think about some of the devaluations that have taken place, it is the reais that really has turned around in this year, but it's still well devalued from where it was just a few years ago. So, the pricing actions we're taking are catching us up to that devaluation, as an example.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Got you. Okay. Thanks. And then final question on the Paint Stores Group, the bounce back that you saw in the same-store growth to about 5.5% from what I think was about 2% last quarter. How much of that was sort of oil and gas either being less onerous or just seasonally less impactful? How much of that was, if you could, parcel it in those two buckets? And how much of that was sort of the loosening up of labor restrictions on the contractor segment?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, I'd first point out that it really points to the strength of what we've seen in the market and our continued drive to get better position in the market. As we've talked about the residential repaint, this is the 11th of 13 quarters with a double-digit gain.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Right.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And so, the other segments, the contractor segments that we focus on were also very, very strong.", "You're right, to some degree, in that the Protective & Marine drag has been weighing on our results, and it was muted because of the seasonality of it. But it still speaks to the strength of those segments, our confidence in our position there and our determination to get even better.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "No, I understand that. But, I mean, 90 days doesn't change your orientation or your strategy that much. You talked about labor constraints as being one of the drivers along with the oil and gas issue the third quarter. (80:43)", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes. Right.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "So, I'm just trying to see how those two played out in the fourth, that's all.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Well, I think it's a smaller quarter, so the absolute numbers improve. And our focus on the Protective & Marine during this fourth quarter is much less because of the seasonality. So, I'm not quite sure if I'm answering your question.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And Protective & Marine was still a drag in the quarter, just less than it has been over the last couple quarters. The majority of the rebound in the comp was from the fact that contractors do not face the same labor constraints in the fourth quarter that they do in the third. We saw a significant pickup in activity amongst new residential, residential repaint, and most of the architectural segments picked up pretty solidly.", "Dmitry Silversteyn - Longbow Research LLC", "Perfect, Bob. That's what I was looking for. Thank you very much.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Dmitry.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Two questions. First of all, the revenue guidance for the fourth quarter I think was low-single-digit and the reported revenues were up 7%. Just curious, the difference between those two numbers, what grew notably faster in 4Q relative to what you guided? That's the first question. The second question relates to what you would tell us to expect for gross margin growth in 2017?", "Allen J. Mistysyn - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "I would say that in the quarter, our Paint Stores Group had a much stronger finish to the year than we had in the guidance. And also, Latin America Coatings Group in the investments that John talked about that the team has been making started paying off and that also was a benefit relative to our guidance.", "As far as the gross margin, I think we don't give out the specific of each of them. But as I mentioned before, the margin improvement, we do expect to have a margin expansion in 2017. It will not be, as you can imagine, similar to previous few years. But with continuous improvement mindset in that, we expect to have some. And the volume gains that Paint Stores Group is getting and putting through our North American supply chain, we do expect to get some margin expansion. The key will be on the SG&A leverage that we get.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "And then just a follow-up on the Paint Stores better than expected. What component of Paint Stores grew better than expected?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Again, just the residential portion of our business was very, very strong. Well, I say that but many of the commercial segments were stronger than we expected as well. We have a very good momentum there.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. In the prepared remarks, Eric, we mentioned that contractor business grew high-single digit. So, that's across all end market, the sales \u2013 architectural paint sales to contractors grew high-single digits.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "And that's an acceleration from third quarter then?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yes.", "Eric Bosshard - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, Eric.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of David Wang with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I have one on your growth versus industry. So, it looks like existing home sales grew a little bit slower than what your Paint Stores Group posted, and I wonder if you could talk about what should be the difference, is it partly the shifts from DIY to pro or is it something else?", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Yeah. First, Dave, I mentioned early on in the call that only about 15%, 20% of residential repaint activity is driven by existing home turnover and what's driving the other part, the 80% to 85%, we believe is rapid appreciation in home values. People are just more comfortable investing in remodeling and repainting activity when they're investing in an appreciating asset. So we think we've gotten a tailwind from appreciating home values that would make actual residential repaint activity in the market outpace what existing home turnover would imply the pace should be.", "We also think that we're gaining share in residential repaint. And that is in part due to your point that the shift from DIY to do it for me, we think that also tends to pick up pace when home values are appreciating. So, the market conditions we're seeing here and particularly driven by rapidly appreciating home values is a net benefit for repaint and remodeling activity.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Great. And then, just a follow-up question. I know we didn't have a particularly good year for housing starts and existing home sales, but I think we grew mid-single digits. If we continue to see rebounding in the housing market, how much operating leverage would you guys be able to see especially flowing through to the Paint Stores Group profit margins?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "We would expect to absolutely leverage the incremental volume through our stores' organization and you're starting to see some of that in the fourth quarter. It's an area of focus for us. This is an important part of our business and one where from an expense standpoint, would not require incremental expense for us to be able to pursue the incremental volume.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "And you mentioned that housing starts are only up mid single-digits. Mid single-digits volume growth to our North America supply chain would generate a pretty substantial amount of leverage.", "David Wang - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "All right. Thank you.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks, David.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Richard O'Reilly with Revere Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Richard O'Reilly, CFA - Revere Associates", "Okay. Thank you. And good morning, gentlemen.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Hi, Richard.", "Richard O'Reilly, CFA - Revere Associates", "Hi. I have a short-term question. Weather-wise, I'm in New Jersey, and we've had a mild winter, and yet when I listen to the national news there's tornadoes and blizzards somewhere else in the country. Is weather so far in January, \"normal\" or is it worse than usual, less than usual, is it affecting your store days to any extent than \"normal\"?", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "So, Richard, we've sworn oath not to ever talk about weather again. There's always good weathering areas and bad weathering areas, and we don't like to point to that. We know that our shareholders are counting on us to make things better every day, and so, yeah, there's areas that have had some tough weather and if it's the ice or tornadoes, whatever, and there are other areas that are nice. And so we quite frankly insist that our people focus on how they improve their results, not report the weather, so. It's not anything I want to really comment on.", "Richard O'Reilly, CFA - Revere Associates", "Okay. Fine. Thank you for your attempt.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you, Richard.", "John G. Morikis - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears we have no additional questions at this time. So, I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Robert J. Wells - The Sherwin-Williams Co.", "Thanks again, Jessie. And first, thanks to all of you for hanging with us this long. I'll wrap up quickly by asking you all to save the date of Thursday, May 25, on your calendars. That's the day we'll host our annual Financial Community Presentation this year in New York at the Marriott Marquis.

Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. In the interest of time, we've provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information on our website, www.sherwin.com under Investor Relations, April 20 Press Release. You will also notice as we go through our results for comparison purposes, our first quarter 2016 results have been restated to reflect the adoption of ASU 2016-09.", "I'll begin by highlighting overall company performance for first quarter 2017 compared to first quarter 2016. Then comment on each reportable segment.", "Consolidated net sales increased $187.4 million or 7.3% to a record $2.76 billion driven primarily by higher paint sales volume in our paint stores group. The change in revenue reclassification adopted last year increased consolidated sales 2.2% in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on sales in the quarter.", "Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $81.4 million or 6.5% to $1.34 billion. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 40 basis points in the quarter to 48.6% of sales from 49% last year.", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $13.8 million or 1.4% to $1.02 billion in the first quarter, but decreased as a percent of sales to 36.8% from 38.9% in the same period last year.", "Interest expense in the quarter was roughly flat to last year at $25.7 million.", "Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter increased $90.2 million or 41.7% to $306.6 million due primarily to improved operating results from our Paint Stores Group and Global Finishes Group.", "Our effective tax rate decreased to 22% from 23.8% in the first quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017 we expect our effective tax rate will be in the mid to high 20s.", "Consolidated net income increased $74.3 million or 45% to $239.2 million. Net income as a percent of sales increased to 8.7% compared to 6.4% in the first quarter last year. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on net income in the quarter.", "Diluted net income per common share for the quarter increased 44.6% to $2.53 per share from $1.75 per share in 2016. The $2.53 includes $0.08 dilution from the acquisition-related expenses and $0.34 accretion from the reduction in income tax provision.", "Looking at our results by operating segment, sales for our Paint Stores Group in the first quarter 2017 increased 12.1% to $1.81 billion from $1.62 billion last year. Paint Stores Group sales increase was due primarily to higher organic paint and equipment sales volumes across all end markets and the impact of the change in revenue classification. Comparable store sales that is sales by stores open more than 12 calendar months increased 7.5%. The change in revenue classification is not reflected in comparable store sales.", "Implementation of the December price increase has also been successful thus far. Regionally, in the first quarter our Southeastern division led all division followed by the Canadian division, Southwestern division, Midwest, and Eastern Division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.", "Segment profit for the Group increased $50.5 million or 20% to $304 million. Segment operating margin increased to16.8% of sales from 15.7% in the first quarter last year.", "Turning to our Consumer Group first quarter sales decreased $40.6 million or 10.7% to $337.5 million due primarily to lower volume sales to most of the Group's retail and commercial customers.", "Segment profit for the Consumer Group decreased $3.4 million or 5.3% to $60.6 million in the quarter from $64 million in the first quarter last year. Segment profit as a percent of external sales increased to 18% from16.9% in the same period last year. Most of the improvement in the first quarter segment profit margin was from improved operating efficiencies and good SG&A expense control.", "For our Global Finishes Group sales in U.S. dollars increased $16.2 million or 3.6% to $470.3 million in the quarter. Currency translation rate changes did not have a significant impact on sales in the quarter. First quarter segment profit stated in U.S. dollars increased $3.9 million or 8% to $52.4 million due primarily to higher paint sales volume and selling price increases that were partially offset by higher raw material costs. As a percent of sales, segment profit increased to11.1% from 10.7% in the same period last year.", "For our Latin America Coatings Group, first quarter net sales stated in U.S. dollars increased $16.2 million or 12.9% to $141.4 million primarily due to selling price increases and favorable currency translation. Currency translation increased sales in U.S. dollars by 5.7% in the quarter.", "Segment profit in U.S. dollars increased to $1.2 million in the quarter from a loss of $900,000 last year. Segment profit was aided by selling price increases which were partially offset by higher raw material costs.

As a percent of net sales, segment operating profit increased to 80 basis points in the quarter compared to a loss of 70 basis points in the first quarter 2016.", "That concludes our review of our operating results for the quarter. So let me turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for second quarter and full year. John?", "John Morikis", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.", "First quarter 2017 was a good quarter for Sherwin-Williams from both a revenue and profit perspective. But there was one obvious exception and as our nature, I'm going to address it first.", "Our Consumer segment had a bad quarter. There are two reasons I feel it's important to address this upfront. One because I don't want you to think that our strong consolidated results diminishes the urgency we feel to address the challenges this group faced in the quarter. And two, because you need to know that nobody is more disappointed in how this quarter unfolded than the women and men responsible for driving this business. Consumer sales in the quarter were weak in most product categories across most market segments in most geographic regions all three months of the quarter. This was not the result of soft sales to one customer or one product line. We were comping against the first quarter 2016 load-in of the INFINITY product line at Lowe's and I wish the explanation for the weakness this year was that simple.", "I believe Consumer Group saw the flip side of the obvious strength in the professional paint market reflected in soft DIY demand in the first quarter, but they will remain focused on expanding our retail presence and driving sell through. You also need to know that I have the utmost confidence in this group. I know they will rise to the challenge. You should expect better results from our consumer segment over the balance of the year.", "The positive momentum we saw in our Paint Stores Group in the fourth quarter last year accelerated in the first quarter. Sales to residential repaint contractors continued its double-digit growth trajectory followed closely by sales to new residential painters, property management contractors, and commercial contractors. Equally encouraging our pro customers continue to report large project backlogs. Protective and marine coating sales and volume turned positive in the quarter, but lagged the pace of growth in architectural paint.", "During the quarter, paint stores group added 10 net new stores while this pace is slower than first quarter 2016, the difference is entirely attributable to timing issues.", "Our plan still calls for full year store openings in the range of 90 to 100 net new locations compared to 94 opened in 2016. Today our total store count in the U.S., Canada, and the Caribbean stands at 4,190 compared to 4,099 a year ago.", "Latin America Coatings Group delivered high-single-digit revenue growth in local currencies in the quarter, although down volumes were still recovering in most countries in the region. As market demand fully recovers, our management teams will continue to make progress on managing operating expenses and mitigating raw material cost inflation.", "Global Finishes Group delivered solid top-line growth in the first quarter with revenues up across all businesses and volumes up in most. Once again, the group did a commendable job of managing both gross margin and SG&A resulting in a cycle high 11.1% first quarter operating margin, 30 basis points better than first quarter last year.", "We continue to see positive demand momentum in many of our industrial coatings businesses in North America, Latin America, and Europe and this team is well-positioned to flow through revenue growth to profit improvement. To get a more accurate picture of our profit performance in the quarter, you need to back up the effect of the two accounting changes we adopted last year plus the acquisition-related expenses. Excluding these items, consolidated gross margins increased 50 basis points to 49.6% of sales. SG&A improved to 37.2% of sales compared to 37.7% last year and PPG margin was 11.8% this year compared to 9.8% last year.", "Our reported tax rate in the first quarter of this year was 22%. If you back out the tax benefit from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 our effective tax rate would have been approximately 33%. Net income would have been $214.1 million, an increase of approximately 25% and earnings per share would have been $2.27 per share, up 25.4%.", "Net working capital increased slightly year-over-year as a percent of sales to 11.5% compared to 11.2% first quarter last year as accounts receivable and inventory both increased to support the strong sales momentum early in the year. In dollar terms, the increase in working capital was $97 million in the quarter compared to an increase of about $80 million in the first quarter last year. Despite the higher March 31 year-over-year working capital, we generated $231.8 million in net operating cash, an improvement of more than $290 million compared to the first quarter 2016 due primarily to the increase in net income and reduction of cash used during the quarter to service accounts payable compared to first quarter 2016.", "Our capital expenditures in the quarter totaled $41.5 million. Depreciation was $44.6 million and amortization was $6.2 million and in 2017, we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $230 million, depreciation of $175 million to $185 million, and the amortization of about $30 million. Capital spending will continue to run higher than normal in 2017 as we complete investments and IT infrastructure, capacity, and new stores.", "Our cash balance on March 31 was just over $1 billion compared to $890 million at the end of 2016. We will continue to build cash on our balance sheet over the coming months to reduce total borrowings required to finance the completion of the Valspar acquisition. Therefore we made no open market purchases of our common stock for treasury during the quarter and we'll suspend share repurchase activity throughout 2017. On March 31, we have remaining authorization to acquire 11.65 million shares.", "Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.85 per share compared to $0.84 per share last year.", "North American architectural paint demand should remain strong throughout the year, driven by steady increasing level of residential remodeling activity and to a lesser degree new residential construction. As we move into the prime painting season, we are also encouraged by growing signs of more robust non-residential activity and improving demand for many of our industrial products.", "While growth in the U.S. Do-It-Yourself market will likely continue to lag the professional painter market, we expect positive sales growth in our consumer segment in the quarters ahead.", "On our year-end 2016 earnings call, I said our expectations for average year-over-year raw material inflation was in the low-single-digits. Given the recent uptick in crude oil, relatively high propylene pricing in the first quarter, tight market conditions in certain key monomers used in the production of latex, and low TiO2 inventories, we now expect raw materials inflation to be in the mid-single-digit range.", "The price increases we have announced to the market thus far in the year appear to be gaining traction and we have not made any additional announcements. We will however continue to monitor changes in the raw material environment and will respond appropriately to changes as we go through the year.", "Our outlook for second quarter 2017 is for consolidated net sales to increase mid-to-high-single-digits percent compared to last year's second quarter driven in part by the revenue reclassification. With sales at that level, we expect diluted net income per common share for the second quarter to be in the range of $4.15 per share to $4.35 per share compared to last year's record $3.99 per share. Our guidance range for second quarter includes acquisition-related expense totaling $0.25 per share.", "As a reminder, second quarter 2016 earnings included $0.16 per share in acquisition-related expenses. For the full-year 2017, we expect consolidated net sales to increase over 2016 by mid-single-digit percentage. With annual sales at that level, we are updating our full-year guidance to be in range of $13.65 to $13.85 per share compared to $11.99 per share in 2016. Our updated full-year 2017 earnings guidance includes $0.40 per share charge for acquisition-related expenses which is $0.40 less than the charge included in our initial full-year guidance. And an increase in the income tax provision benefit of $0.25 per share more than forecasted in our original 2017 EPS guidance. These two items account for all of the change in our full-year 2017 EPS guidance.", "As a reminder, full-year 2016 earnings per share included $0.86 per share related to the Valspar acquisition and $0.40 accretion from the adoption of ASU 2016-09.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning and now we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "Our first question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Parkinson", "Thank you. Can you just talk a little bit more about the implementation of your PSG price increases and just a rough breakdown of how you think it's going between both short and long-term contractors, I'm assuming most short-term contractors have immediately accepted it. And then also is your expectation for the resin solvents and latex baskets sort of moderate in the second half and if not, it sounds like another price increase would be under consideration? Are we thinking about that correctly?", "Al Mistysyn", "Hi, Chris this is Al Mistysyn and I'm going to take the first part of your question related to the price increase in our Paint Stores Group. As a reminder you know the last price increase we went out was the first quarter of 2014. We announced the price increase in December 1, 2016 about 3% to 5% and while none of our customers like seeing their prices go up, they understood the cost environment, we are operating in and they're accepting that price increase and I would say that the rate of realization or effectiveness of that increase is slightly ahead of where we expected it to be.", "Bob Wells", "And Chris, this is Bob. Let me handle the question on raw materials, we often talk about the many moving parts of the raw material basket and as John indicated, we've seen a fair amount of movement in a number of areas since our year-end call. While our outlook for TiO2 in fact hasn't changed much. We still expect mid-to-upper-single-digit inflation for the year in TiO2. We are seeing more pressure in some of the petrochemical based materials. This is a result of a number of factors, most importantly; higher propylene cost in the first quarter higher than we expected in fact and tight market conditions, which we think are transitory tight market conditions in certain monomers in particular MMA and VAM. And while the effect of these petrochemical factors may be somewhat transitory and aren't likely to result in a runaway raw material basket, they have pushed our expectations up from low-single-digit to mid-single-digit.", "In the first quarter, we think we were probably at the top end of that low-single-digit range may be in the 3% to 3.5% range. We do expect to see some incremental inflation in the second quarter. And we think that the year-over-year inflation is likely to peak in the second quarter. Then we start rolling through the price increases taken in TiO2 last year which the year-over-year inflation should ease somewhat in the second half.", "Chris Parkinson", "That's great color. And just a quick follow-up, can you give a little more color on your expectations for the Consumer Group on a go-forward basis, including any incremental growth spend you see key trends you're seeing in the big boxes and/or any benefits potentially from a full year INFINITY we should be considering. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Yes, so we don't talk about any specific customers so I'm not address the INFINITY directly. I will say that, as I mentioned earlier that the overall performance for the quarter fell short of our expectations and while we found ourselves in a situation where we felt there was weakness across the board. And it was a very challenging market. We just, we don't accept that.", "And so the answer your question, our expectations moving forward to be the best partner possible to our customers. And that means helping them get product off the shelf it's not our desire to fill their shelves is to help them get product off the shelves. I don't -- I don't want to get into a lot of specifics on our strategy to be able to do that. I will say that our teams. We have great confidence in our teams. We've got and I think the terrific strategy. We are looking forward to the combined business once we close on Valspar we think added to assets together or the people, the brands everything will make us better and we're focused on every one of our customers and helping them to be more successful.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Good morning. First, I guess I just wanted to ask if you could elaborate on some of the comments you made on volume. You said that you are starting the see some improvements and in some of your markets. So maybe you can break that out on resi repayment and new construction and non-res and so on. Thanks.", "John Morikis", "Yes, I would say that we're very pleased in the stores segment's performance while we don't give specific numbers. I will tell you that the residential repaying once again had a double-digit gain. This will be the 12th of 14 quarters that we've had double-digit gains and we feel as though there is a terrific momentum. I've got that's great respect for that team and what they're executing on right now is just been terrific.", "I would like to take you back to the second and third quarter of last year when we started talking about the challenges that some of our customers were talking about at that time which was their view of the world included a great confidence in the projects that they were working on and the bidding that they were doing, and if there was any concern in their comments, it was typically that they had more work than labor. And so while our residential repaying business has been growing for 12 to 14 quarters I have more confidence right now probably than ever because our team is really responded.", "We're not exactly sure what the second and third quarter has in store for us as it relates to labor and any constraints that they, our customers might experience but we're not waiting and our teams have been working very aggressively and filling the pipeline with new accounts to try to offset any slowdown that our customers might have in growing their business. It's a matter of are they at capacity or not. The residential repaying we're very excited about and momentum. The others commercial, new residential, I mean it is, is really a very strong quarter of stores organization, in fact even protective and marine we had a couple years of softness in protective and marine through our stores. We had a positive quarter in sales of protective and marine and that some of the bottoming out of the oil and gas, but we've been talking about pivoting into different segments and trying to accelerate in those segments. We'd like it to be faster without exception but we're starting to see some momentum there.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Great, thanks. And just as a quick follow-up given the strong volume I would have expected a slightly higher margin but I understand that the odds were definitely a pressure. So maybe you can just discuss how you're thinking about gross margin relative to your typical ranges and how that should progress through the year. Thanks.", "John Morikis", "The gross margin, I think in our first quarter, we were pretty happy with that result on the core we saw a 60 basis point improvement. As the year unfolds as Bob mentioned, the second quarter, we expect year-over-year, raw material inflation to be -- to peak we're confident that we can recoup the inflation in the market. It just doesn't happen in real time and as we see that the rest of the year unfolds on the effectiveness of our price increase, where raw materials trend out at the end of the second quarter, we'll have a better line of sight to our gross margins and update accordingly.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Hi thanks very much. In the Paint Stores business, did your price increases offset your raw material inflation?", "John Morikis", "Yes I believe in the first quarter our effectiveness was better than we thought and more than offset the raw material increase.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "And are your raw material increases in the United States greater on a percentage basis than your raw material increases in the offshore markets?", "John Morikis", "Latin America will be higher, higher but across the rest of the globe, I'd say the U.S. the impact of titanium dioxide that has on our U.S. business is probably a little higher in the U.S.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "Okay. And could you provide the gross profit changes in your division?", "John Morikis", "Yes. So Paint Stores Group increased $82.5 million, Latin America Coatings Group increased $4.9 million, Global Finishes Group increased $6.6 million, and Consumer decreased $10.2 million.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "John, just going back to -- good morning Bob. Just going back to the protective and marine sales turning positive is that just a function of easier comparisons after several tough quarters or do you actually sense some more activity and optimism at the end market level? How should we think about that?", "John Morikis", "No, it's certainly some easier numbers, but I would definitely say that it has an equal if not more result of the efforts that our teams are putting forward. I think that we are seeing some benefit in the market, we're seeing some easier comparison and we're certainly witnessing some benefit of the pivoting into some of the other segments I spoke of.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "So that being said and going back to the first quarter an upside on earnings relative to your initial guidance what actually drove the bulk of that upside was it just P&M sort of a little bit better than you thought, pricing realization being a little bit better, or was it just the volumes in Paint Stores Group?", "John Morikis", "Volumes in Paint Stores Group were very strong and as I mentioned I could go on every segment just as much passion as I started with resi paint but each one of our segments have really shown terrific growth and we're feeling really good about it and protective marine wasn't the headwind that it had been in the past.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve Byrne", "Yes, thank you. How would you rank these potential drivers of the strength that you saw in volume in your Paint Stores Group potentially better than expected whether the backlog that your contract customers have a shift towards more of the pro contractor versus DIY versus just kind of backlog in resi repaint demand.", "Bob Wells", "Yes Steve this is Bob. I think if I would rank those items, the number one would be, as we've discussed on a number of quarters our customers, our professional customers are labor constrained in the high season quarters second and third much less so in the first and fourth. So we saw a rebound of comps in the fourth quarter that rebound actually accelerated in the first quarter, it tends to be their smallest volume quarter. So I think the fact that we're seeing a flattening out of volume in the industry from the traditional bell shaped curve to more volume in the out quarters that that would be number one.", "I think number two is the shift from DIY to contractor. I think we are with rising home values, rising equity markets, increasing consumer confidence, a stronger employment backdrop all those things, the homeowners are really getting confident in hiring contractors as opposed to doing project themselves. One of the things that is driving incremental volume for us is by our own doing. It's not a market force, it's more our focus on new account activation on growing share of wallet amongst our small share customers is certainly driving volume growth in that segment and leading to what we believe to be a probably 2X plus rate of growth -- volume growth in paint stores of the 2X plus the market rate of growth. We don't think weather had an impact on the first quarter.", "Steve Byrne", "And then on the retail and commercial customer side of the business, would you say your volumes lagged overall volume growth in those channels and if so why?", "John Morikis", "Are you talking about in our stores organization, Steve?", "Steve Byrne", "No, through the retail and independents.", "John Morikis", "Through the consumers, yes consumer did lag and that's the comments that I made earlier, as far as we found some challenging markets and customers there is not one that I would point you to say that there was one customer, one geography, as I mentioned earlier, there was -- there were some challenges that we faced throughout nearly every market with many customers facing some tougher sales and our focus remains on helping them to be more successful.", "Steve Byrne", "I guess my point on that one John is, were you in line with the overall market or not?", "John Morikis", "It's hard to say, I don't. I will say that we didn't experience any shelf loss, we've not found ourselves in situations where we feel as though we've lost shelf to our competitors we're just really trying to focus on helping our customers sell more product off the shelf.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Matt Gingrich", "Thanks, this is Matt Gingrich on for Vincent. I was just wondering if you -- how the Do-It-Yourself sales in the Paint Stores Group trended in the quarter?", "Bob Wells", "A little softer than our pro business positive.", "Matt Gingrich", "Okay. And then in terms of the monthly cadence of the Paint Stores Group performance?", "Bob Wells", "In Do-It-Yourself as well or?", "Matt Gingrich", "No, just broadly.", "John Morikis", "I don't think there was a significant difference throughout the quarter.", "Bob Wells", "If you adjust for days.", "John Morikis", "If you adjust for days.", "Bob Wells", "Right.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Robert Koort", "John can you help us scale the non-architectural book of business through PSG and maybe the big components of that, so we can sort of think about those markets bottoming and what they might contribute as you come out of that down cycle if you will?", "John Morikis", "I would say the non-paint categories remain strong. And I'd say the growth rates are in line with paint demand; we're seeing good momentum in those -- in those categories.", "Robert Koort", "I guess in the industrial coatings that you sell through your Paint Stores?", "John Morikis", "P&M you talk Protective & Marine?", "Robert Koort", "Yes whatever else you would consider non-architectural paint?", "John Morikis", "I'm sorry; I thought you meant non-paint sorry. No, I think that as I mentioned Protective & Marine sales were up but not in the same range as our architectural category, so it's certainly in our expectation that they wouldn't go from a direct headwind to a strong tailwind. And so we feel as though, as I mentioned, it's bottoming out in the industrial businesses inside our stores and through a lot of effort and some of the markets improving, we feel as though it's going to help us. It won't turn into a terrific tailwind for us immediately though.", "Bob Wells", "And Bob that the Protective & Marine is really the only material non-architectural business in Paint Stores Group, the rest of that would fall in the Global Finishes.", "Robert Koort", "And then you mentioned just timing on the store count, but obviously if you're going to get up to 90 or 100, you got to start adding quickly in the prime paint season in front of you. So should we expect 30 or 40 units added in the second quarter?", "John Morikis", "Yes it's funny we had this discussion every quarter and we like to see those numbers little smoother. But as you would expect with just different construction regulations and ordinances it's just a little bit of challenge to smooth those up. Bob, yes, we're going to load up, we're confident in the year. And no one should read anything into the number little softer in the quarter than what we would have liked but it was truly just a matter of in some cases getting permits, occupancy permits we're on, we're on the same point, we should be ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson", "Thank you. John, I want to go back to the Consumer Group with are you seeing any destocking or inventory reduction at the big boxes, given that they're seeing lower overall levels of demand. And have you been able to get any price increases this year in from, from your Consumer Group customers.", "John Morikis", "On the inventory piece that's always something that we're trying to work with, with our customers. We want to as part of being their best supplier; we want to be the ones that can offer them the best service, so that they don't have working capital tied up in that. And so there is always in those discussions and I wouldn't say that to any greater extent, then we would expect or quite frankly that we would want. We want to help our customers in those terms.", "In regards to pricing, we don't comment on the pricing on that side of the business. We've spoken to our stores and we've spoken to the raw material basket but we, because of the competitive nature of those customers, we don't speak to any specific customers outside of our stores.", "Don Carson", "Okay. And a follow-up on the overall market, you talked about how not only is architectural demand strong but you're seeing strong non-residential and industrial demand. I think last year you said the market grew 2.5% would you, it sounds like you're expecting higher growth in the overall market this year is that an accurate reflection.", "Bob Wells", "Hey Don are you talking about the U.S architectural market of the overall paid incumbent?", "Don Carson", "U.S. architectural market because it sounds like you're seeing some positive things on the commercial side of that as well.", "Bob Wells", "Yes and we've learned over the last couple years that the tale of the tape for market growth is going to be -- is going to be determined in the second and third quarter. It really depends on the labor supply in the professional painter market. We know that labor supply is growing, is it growing at the rate of demand growth doubtful. So to what extent market wise, labor is a constraint to volume growth this year time will tell. We think that the demand in the market is sufficient to drive industry growth well ahead of low-single-digits, well into the mid-single-digits.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Leithead", "Hey guys it's actually Mike Leithead on for Duffy this morning.", "Bob Wells", "Hey Mike.", "Mike Leithead", "Hey Bob. Just want to come back to the commentary you made on strong paint stores volumes in the quarter. Is it fair to say you're seeing somewhat of a shift? I guess in your customer behavior to kind of compensate for the tight labor market in 2Q, 3Q. So may be the seasonal fall off in paint stores during 1Q and 4Q should maybe a little bit less so as contract just try to get projects on that are either pushed out or pulled earlier.", "Bob Wells", "I think you're right, Mike, I think you'll see some flattening of the bell curve certainly not an all exterior projects but where possible there is certainly going to be some products or projects that can get pushed out into the fourth quarter they may have been completed in the third.", "Mike Leithead", "Got it. And then a bit of a technical one here for my follow-up, so I apologize that, on the income tax provision accounting change you realized $0.34 benefit this quarter and now the new full-year guide assumes $0.45 benefit for the full-year. Where should we think about that remaining $0.11 being I'm assuming there is none in 2Q because you guys have been called out of your guide is that correct?", "John Morikis", "Well, Mike, what we've done in it typical practice in the past as we've annualized, these types of changes we start including them in our core and that's why we didn't call it out on our second quarter. I think what you see is if you look at how the adjustments rolled out in the quarters last year they maybe a little bit muted from a timing standpoint, but they're smaller and probably typical of what you'll see going forward.", "I would say our first quarter was, was higher than what we are certainly expecting higher than last year and it was just a pure function of the amount of options that were exercised and the run-up in our stock price after the first -- our year-end call.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes good morning Thank you. You indicated that your SG&A ratio to sales was down about 210 basis points year-over-year. I was wondering if you could address what you're doing broadly to control costs and achieve that and specifically the extent to which you can address costs in anticipation of the Valspar deal and whether or not that is -- that is part of the tailwind there so to speak.", "Al Mistysyn", "Sure, Kevin if you go back and look at the sales out of our coming out of our third quarter last year, rightfully so the teams took action on SG&A with a reduced sales with an eye towards the risk of that and the de-levering we saw and we're seeing the benefit of -- benefits of those actions in our first quarter. And the expectation is that we'll manage our SG&A type until we get through the second quarter, we see the initiatives that John had talked about, about the new account activation, and how those are progressing and with an eye towards making sure that if labor constraints occur again in our third quarter like they had in the past two years we will be positioned well to overcome those. As far as an eye to Valspar that is absolutely a consideration. But I think we have a responsibility to manage our core and the operating margins related to our core and we'll manage the Valspar integration as soon as it closes and we're well prepared for that.", "Bob Wells", "And Kevin, a quick point of clarification the SG&A as a percent of sales improvement was -- was magnified by the change in revenue classification the revenue reclassification apples-to-apples comparison it was actually down 50 basis points.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thank you for the clarification, Bob. And then second question I had was on pricing. You mentioned that your pace of realization exceeded your prior expectation. I guess two facets number one was all of the December 1 increase implemented by March 31 or is there a residual to come. And then second, given your expectation of higher raw's, again relative to last quarter. Are there increases recently announced or on the table outside of architectural in the balance of your portfolio. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "So, on the first piece, no, I wouldn't say that it's been fully executed. We're working with customers across all businesses on stepping those price increases in. On the second question --", "Bob Wells", "On the second question that we, we have gone out in with price in our other businesses. We don't typically talk about those on magnitude in that, but we have where we're certainly seeing pressure from a raw material standpoint.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I had two. Want to dig into a little bit more on the consumer groups issues where you sort of backorder, obviously you're going to fix it. I guess I'm trying to understand. I think also says across geographies, across retailers that it was kind of across the board. I think you referenced some softness in DIY but looking at it a little bit deeper I was wondering you can give us a little bit more color on what you think you exactly led to such broad based conditions in that segment and how you fix it.", "John Morikis", "Yes, I mean little hesitant to do that, and only because from a strategic standpoint, I want to play my cards a little close to our best. I do feel though that it's fair to say that the teams that we have around the world, but particularly here in the U.S. because of the size of this business. Our focus on those areas as I mentioned earlier, I'm trying to help our customers to be more successful by selling more products rather than getting products in the shelf lane out the specifics on how we plan on doing that's something I'd rather show you the results and explain to you as we're working on these what we're doing.", "Scott Mushkin", "But how about what went wrong I mean do you think with specific to you guys or do you think it's just the weakness in the market. I mean where maybe some light there on what went wrong?", "John Morikis", "I mentioned that we have not experienced any shelf loss. I wouldn't say that we're -- we're feeling as though we're on the backend of any deals that went the other way but at the same time we're far from complacent, assuming everything is okay. We have -- we have very high expectations of our team and I do think that they found themselves as I mentioned in a challenging market. That said, we have higher expectations for ourselves and our investors should have higher expectations of us.", "Scott Mushkin", "Right. And just switching gears and goes to my next question is in the Paint Stores Group as we've seen -- saw last summer things slow down, some of that was labor but also there was this idea I think it came up in the third quarter that Do-It-Yourself is really just not all that robust and of course we're just having other discussion whether it's DIY market mostly. I mean how confident are you as we get to the second and third quarters you are particularly at third quarter which even the Paint Stores Group has more of a DIY component to it that we won't see the same slowdown, we have seen we saw last year?", "John Morikis", "Well as I mentioned and as Bob mentioned as well and we're now waiting to see last year's second quarter when we started to hear from our customers that they were concerned with their ability to grow their business. We started right then mobilizing our sales organization to effectively increase the number of accounts that we have an account activation program. So the good news that we see is that the fundamentals of the market are very, very strong, it's a matter of how much our customers can apply product and so many of them as we've said found themselves at capacity.", "Well when you find your customers at capacity and you want to grow your business, you got to find new customers and so we've been working very, very hard at both the share of wallet customers that are currently in our store that offer more opportunity as well as customers that are in other locations buying product and we've had some success there. So we're not waiting for the second and third quarter to play out. We're taking steps right now to control our future and we'll see how effectively we're compared to what the constraints in the markets are. But we're not just waiting for things, good things to happen to us.", "Scott Mushkin", "That's great news. And then just one technical how big is DIY and Paint Stores Group in the third quarter is it proportionately a lot bigger and then on yield?", "Bob Wells", "Scott we've described DIY has been between 10% and 15% of the segment. It would be less than that; it would be smaller in the first and fourth quarters.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor", "John and Bob whoever wants take it. Just a question on that, given that you posted growth at DIY at the stores and that's a pretty big gap relative to what you're calling from mark in the consumer, how would you explain that differential?", "John Morikis", "Well few things, Scott first the DIY number that Bob just quoted as far as our percent of sales was a total year it's a first quarter is a relatively small quarter for us in DIY. There is a shift clearly there is a shift from do-it-for-me to do-it-yourself to do-it-for-me. But there is still an awful lot of opportunity for us to continue to grow our business. Inside our stores we talked to DIY consumer because it's an important component not only in trying to grow our business but the DIY is a relatively small piece, we want that homeowner accepting our product coming in the door with the painting contractor. So in the first quarter, while it was up slightly, I'd say it's a relatively small percentage of our business it is the first quarter.", "Scott Rednor", "And then I just wanted to ask about the approach to guidance, I mean even with that headwind on consumer and you think it's getting better stores came in better than you saw in the first quarter and you guys beat by $0.20 on a kind of a core basis. So recognizing you have ROTH coming up, can you may be just explain the approach so holding the full year stable even though you're coming out of 1Q better than you thought?", "John Morikis", "Yes, you're right, we are pleased with our results in Q1 and again pointing to stores and even our Global Finishes Group momentum, we feel good about that. We've got great confidence in our strategy and great confidence in our team, so that as I feel like I have repeated a few times here, it's important part of our culture here and Sherwin, there is no complacency despite the fact that we had a good first quarter.", "But that said, and if you'll pardon a sports analogy I know you're a Yankees fan, but I'll use our beloved Cleveland Indians which we're very proud of. First inning of the game they may put a lot of runs on, on the scoreboard, but they don't start packing our bats after the first inning and so Scott, I'd say we're not packing our bat after the first quarter, we typically earn about I'd say between 15% and 20% of our full-year EPS in the first quarter and I'd say probably what else 65% to 70% in the middle two quarters.", "Bob Wells", "Yes.", "John Morikis", "And so in other words we make our year in those middle quarters so not to overuse it but after the first quarter we're not ready to pack up our bags and go home. We've often said here at Sherwin that here is a strong weak in July can make up for a weak month in the first quarter. So while we're confident in our outlook and we have plans in place to sustain our momentum throughout the year we prefer to wait until we get this second quarter under our belt before making any adjustments in either direction to our full-year guidance, lot of confidence but we just think it's prudent to, to see this through.", "Scott Rednor", "I appreciate that John. I hope the hot start for the Yankees continued to but and then just lastly, maybe just on the cash flow obviously is very strong and 1Q atypical that you generate any cash is there anything we should be aware of as we think about the full-year timing or some normalization.", "Bob Wells", "Yes, if you look at our cash benefit in the first quarter net income obviously grew very nicely. We did get the benefit of the cash flow hedge settlement in our first quarter that was about $88 million. And then if you remember, coming out of our year-end 2015 our working capital as a percent of sales was really low was 8.6% and then when you look at the impact of working capital on cash flow the change first quarter versus year-end so we saw a much bigger change in our first quarter 2016 than we saw in our first quarter 2017 due to the timing of payments. And so you won't have, you'll have that rollout, but it will be much more muted as the year goes on.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Sison", "Hey guys, nice quarter. In terms of your outlook for industrial demand, it sounds like it's incrementally gotten better as the quarter unfolded. What are your thoughts there as you head into 2Q and Valspar closed here any general thoughts you feel even more excited on what Valspar could given they've got more industrial exposure.", "John Morikis", "Yes but we better, right we've sort of lot of money to get those yes, we're very excited about what they bring very complementary in nature. We have gotten those, some of the people inside Valspar deeper into the organization and we're just absolutely thrilled with the team their approach, their attitude. We're anxious to be able to exchange more information and, but we know that's right around the corner.", "You're right, our feeling about how our team in the industrial side of our business has been doing has us feeling more bullish than we have in the past and that comes from a number of different areas. One is they have there was a question earlier, I think Greg asked about SG&A and our management of SG&A on the Global Finishes Group side, they've been managing that business very well. So, they're positioned quite frankly to be able to flow a lot of -- a lot of profit through our incremental sales. And the pipeline of customers that they've been working on line trials and the confidence that they have going forward has definitely improved. So we're feeling pretty good about that team and what they're trying to accomplish and likelihood that they'll get there.", "Mike Sison", "Great and then one quick follow-up for the Consumer Group if your team and plans are successful for -- would you expect sales to turn positive this year at some point in the given quarter -- earlier than expectation?", "Bob Wells", "No, Mike, I think if you look at our sales guidance again in our second quarter, mid-to-high-single-digits in that guidance, you have to expect that our Consumer Group will perform better than it did, certainly in our first quarter.", "John Morikis", "Yes, we've not lowered our expectations of that team.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts", "Good morning. I guess I got one last minute to say that.", "Bob Wells", "Good morning, John.", "John Roberts", "On the Valspar purchase price premium I assume that you'd like to assign as much as possible to writing up finished inventory to market. Should we expect that you and Valspar are producing and holding as much inventory, inventories you can prior to closing so you can expense more of the premium in the first year.", "Bob Wells", "No, John, I would that is not the case. I think what you probably saw in our results we carry more inventory in our first quarter and the reason we did that as with the strong sales of our Paint Storage Group coming out of the fourth quarter and the momentum they carried into our first quarter. We wanted to make sure we continue to service our customers that a high level. So we ended up carrying more inventory on the Sherwin side and that\u2019s why you saw the working capital up a little bit year-over-year, but I would not say that's a driver of the inventory.", "John Morikis", "And John I know from our past discussions that you know this, but we couldn\u2019t coordinate anything like that with Valspar anyway. I mean that's on the other side of the wall. So we're not allowed to have those types of discussions.", "John Roberts", "Do you have any update to the amortization expense for 2018 or first 12 months?", "Bob Wells", "I do not we're still, we're still working through that valuation and again on that side it's really Valspar's working on that. And we'll see that as soon as the detail related to the valuation as soon as we close. But we're not in able to see all the detail related to step up and assets and the like as soon as we know, John, we will be out and giving you that information.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Well, I guess mine is the first good afternoon question.", "Bob Wells", "Good afternoon, Dmitry.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Couple of questions, first of all just, trying to understand your margin performance by divisions, you've had very strong growth obviously in volumes in the store group and that seems to -- with the offset price increase in the raw materials, it drove the margin up year-over-year, which I guess. What I'm struggling to understand a little bit is your Consumer Group where your revenues were down, your volumes were down. I don't think you've got price increases in there. Your raw materials were up and your margin were still up better than the point year-over-year. So can you talk about sort of what you're doing on the cost side or the mix side to allow you to get that margin lift.", "Bob Wells", "Sure. Dmitry first off, I think the team has done a nice job at reducing their SG&A in this environment. But the other thing you have to remember is our global supply chain runs through that segment and we're seeing nice operating efficiency improvements with the gallon that Paint Stores Group is producing in flowing through that group.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay so that so volume impacts from the paint stores. Okay.", "Bob Wells", "Right.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. And then my second question is that you really have spent a lot of time talking about your Global division, which is more industrial and more global as name implies. So can you provide a little bit more of sort of a granular color on perhaps some of the regions or some of the business lines or industries that have done well for you. I mean the mid-single-digit growth you delivered is a little bit higher than your averaged the last two, three years in that division.", "John Morikis", "Yes, you're exactly right now Dmitry and across the board, and all three of those areas. We saw an improved run rate. And I'd say we're feeling good as I mentioned just a moment ago about the pipeline of tests and trial runs that we've had continues to move in the right direction. We've been aggressive in the SG&A side on that business. And at the same time, we've been investing in new products and people that we feel can help drive our business forward.", "And so I'd say that across the Group through the three different businesses we saw sales gains across all three. We're feeling good about the momentum that they're gaining as they as they go forward. And as I mentioned the number of qualified trial runs that we've been on, has improved. So we're feeling better going forward.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay, thanks. And then one last question, you mentioned the foreign exchange didn't have much of an impact on revenue growth in the first quarter. But I'm imagining it wasn't zero impact. So what was the foreign exchange contribution or the headwind in the first quarter on the revenues?", "Bob Wells", "I mean it was less than 0.1%", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Harrison", "Wondering if you can address your marketing spend in the first quarter. Obviously, we've already talked a little bit about the SG&A declining as a percent of sales, and I'm wondering if there were any changes related to timing or spending on the marketing front?", "Bob Wells", "No, there were really no significant changes in the spending or timing, Mike. I'd say there were; as we look at SG&A, I think we've we have looked at those types of efficiencies where we might have had two different business units buying different products from -- from different suppliers or partners. I mean just the basics that you would have expected. But given some of the size of some of our spend it can be fair savings so and then we're looking at trying to be as smart as we can with our spend without impacting the face to the customer.", "Mike Harrison", "I was also hoping you could talk a little bit about the as you're moving towards closing on the Valspar acquisition, how do you plan to handle the Valspar brand at Lowe's obviously that's one that Lowe's and Valspar spent a lot of money on and that was a big marketing push but probably less efficient for both you and Lowe's to support both of those brands going forward Any thoughts on that?", "Bob Wells", "Well, sure we have a lot of thoughts about the value of that brand I mean that's tremendous asset and one we want to get behind. We help -- we think it helps us with all our customers certainly not just Lowe's but it helps us with current Valspar customers as well as customers that are currently buying Sherwin-Williams branded products as the technology that we have -- we purchased can be moved into other different brands or other different customers. But all of those -- all of those decisions always come back to what I mentioned earlier, which is working with our customers on helping them to develop the best plan to help them grow more -- grow more product going out of their stores. So you asked specifically about Lowe's that but it could be with every customer that we're going to have combined we'll sit down with each one of them and develop a plan and how to best utilize all the assets that we have.", "Mike Harrison", "All right. And then last one I have is on the Latin America business you opened 23 new stores in Q4 then you only opened three in Q1 can you provide any sense on where you expect the store count to be at year-end 2017 relative to the 342 that you had at the end of Q1?", "John Morikis", "I think what you'll see is we opened 47 new stores last year. I think -- I think you'll see a slightly lower number than that and it's based on timing in the markets and similar type of issues we run into in the U.S.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli & Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering if you could talk about the potential impact from big infrastructure bill coming up potentially.", "John Morikis", "We love big infrastructure bills. Our Protective & Marine team has a good position in many aspects of the structural steel, the bridge and highway, water-wastewater, pretty much across the board. So we have -- we believe a terrific product line an outstanding distribution model, which we can utilize various stores that are properly equipped to take care of our customers that terrific technical people and a wonderful sales organization. So we've got a good position there and we'd love nothing better to see spending in this area.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Have you included any potential gains in your current expectations for the year or it will be a bonus on top of whatever you're expecting now.", "John Morikis", "We have not included any specifics to any kind of an infrastructure bill.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "Okay, thanks. And then if I may, you have given the June 21 as the date to close the Valspar transaction could the timing of that closer trends can it be sooner than the June 21?", "John Morikis", "It certainly can. Our expectation would be that it is most likely to close before the June 21 date, it doesn't, we have not given that as the date of close. So the agreement that we that that we had signed originally with Valspar provided for to a provision a three-month extension, it happened to land on June 21 that was the three-month extension. So our hope and expectation as we move through that process is that we'll be able to close before then.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And do you have the total CapEx number for the combined companies?", "Bob Wells", "Not quite at this point, Rosemarie. I think I mean we are both running around to a little bit over 2% in short-term. I would say that's probably going to hold but mid-to-long-term, we see that come down as a percent of sales.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.", "John Morikis", "Chuck?", "Operator", "Chuck your line is live; you may proceed with your question. We will move onto our next question which is coming from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.", "Greg Melich", "Could you -- I think you said price, volume, mix were all positive. But could you give us a little more insight as to how much of that the Paint Stores Group comp was volume versus price mix?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, Chuck, we talked about getting good traction on pricing. I'm sorry Greg, we have talked about getting good traction on pricing so far in Paint Stores Group but the vast majority of Paint Stores Comp was volume.", "Greg Melich", "Okay. So I could assume that's like better than 5%.", "Bob Wells", "Yes.", "Greg Melich", "Will be the vast majority, great. And then a follow-up and maybe it's certainly around you touched on a little bit in Latin America and we were finally I think I heard in the prepared comments that we got top-line growth but the volume is now improving but less negative, did I get that right? And if that's so are there any markets where actually is up or maybe okay.", "Bob Wells", "I'm sorry, go ahead please.", "Greg Melich", "So just if you could talk a little bit about that, like volume in Latin America was still down but down less and just sort of highlight some of the markets that were outliers will be great?", "John Morikis", "Yes, so we have had a couple of markets there that have moved in the right direction from what both a sales and volume standpoint. We've had mix that we've had couple that have not broken to that line yet. I would say that even in those areas that we're a little under pressure, we still saw improvement in specific segments. And so we're -- we're feeling better about Latin America as a whole. We're now to the point after release screwing down the expenses there, we have invested a little bit of money in some of the things that we think will continue to drive business clearly will keep that on a short leash. But we don't break out by country or business unit down there Greg, but I would say that it's safe to say that we've had positive momentum in all of them, some of them are in fact, positive volumes.", "Greg Melich", "Great. But the volumes overall are still down, but just down less than they have been in a while.", "John Morikis", "They're just slightly negative, just slightly.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Stephen East with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Stephen East", "Thank you. John, I'll apologize to you before I ask another consumer question. But as you looked at the monthly progression through the quarter, what it looked like and following on that, how much as you look in the forward quarters, how much of this is market recovery versus what you all are doing with specific actions?", "John Morikis", "I would say from a quarter-to-quarter, I'm sorry month-to-month within the quarter is there was choppiness; there was no trend that I could speak to that. And quite frankly that's a little why we were able to manage the SG&A as we did because we didn't see any traction earlier on in the quarter and so since the November, October time last year we've been really trying to manage the expenses on this business. Going forward, I'd say that the expectations that we have would have to include catching up on some of the business that we had expected to see already and it's going to be hard to say how much of that is market improvement and how much of that is some of the product that we had hoped would have been shipped prior to this moment actually getting shipped.", "So it's going to be a little difficult for us to have that clean line of sight. Again I'd reiterate that and we're feeling good about the relationships that we have with our customers and not having experienced a specific loss of any space. We truly believe that working with our customers and this is what we have been working on to make them better is going to be the answer.", "Stephen East", "Okay, thanks. And then in the spirit of the first 100 days of the administration, your first 100 days with Valspar where do you all sort of rank order your focus areas very early on in the combination of the two companies?", "John Morikis", "Customer is number one always number one. We want to get in front of as many customers as we can. We've got a very detailed plan on how we approach this and we're anxious to get in front of those customers as quickly as possible.", "Number two employees. We've got because of the line of sight of our customers is somewhat muted, we don't have specific customers to see we can't exchange that information. We have plans to be in certain business units to visit with those key customers but we do know where the employees are and so getting in front of those customers, employees, and working with them to really put them at ease on the exciting future that they're going to have with Sherwin-Williams would be second.", "From there, there is a great deal of effort that has gone into the blueprinting of the businesses, how we're going to move forward in areas such as removing complexity, value capture, exchange of information, exchange of technology, and each business unit has mapped those out in great detail. Again there are limits in what we can exchange but there's a lot of things that we can and so we've had the right people engaged in the room in talking about what those priorities are and we've got that down business to business, line by line and we're very excited, if there's been any positive at all to this business taking a little longer to be combined than what we would have liked, it's been our ability to work in greater detail on some of the things that we may not have gotten to until month two or three. But with the additional time, we've been able to get deeper, where legally allowed.", "Stephen East", "All right. I appreciate the in depth on that. Thanks.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you, Stephen.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears there are no additional questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Jessie. Back on April 3rd, we announced that we are rescheduling our financial community presentation from our original May 25 to October 3. Our intent all along this year was to focus the meeting on the details of the Valspar transaction and integration progress and needless to say with the delay in closing the acquisition, these details aren't going to be available on May 25. We think postponing the event to fulfill our original intent will be more valuable to you and the presentation will still be held at the Marriott Marquis in New York, we hope you can join us. Registration details will be emailed late summer and we look forward to hosting a great meeting and we thank you for your flexibility.", "As always, I will be available over the next few days to handle any follow-up questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. I'd like to thank you again for joining us today and thank you for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

After the Company\u2019s prepared remarks, we will open the session to questions.", "I will now turn the call over to Bob Wells.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks, Jessie. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us.", "In the interest of time, we have provided some balance sheet items and other selected financial information, including a slide deck with a breakdown of results by our new reportable segment on our website, sherwin.com, under Investor Relations, October 24th press release.", "I\u2019ll begin by highlighting overall Company performance for the third quarter 2017 compared to third quarter 2016, then comment on each reportable segment. Consolidated net sales increased 37.4% or $1.23 billion to $4.51 billion due primarily to Valspar sales and higher paint sales volume in the Americas Group and Performance Coatings Group, partially offset by the impact of the hurricanes in Texas, Florida and the Caribbean. Excluding Valspar results, core consolidated sales increased 4.6% over the third quarter last year, with a significant portion of the increase coming from sales to our North American paint stores.", "Consolidated gross profit dollars increased $265.7 million or 16.2% to $1.9 billion in the quarter. Our consolidated gross margin decreased 770 basis points in the quarter to 42.2% of sales from 49.9% in the third quarter last year. Excluding the impact from Valspar, core gross margins declined 140 basis points in the quarter to 48.5% of sales.", "Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 24.4% or $256 million over the third quarter last year to $1.31 billion. As a percent of sales, SG&A decreased 300 basis points to 29.0% in the third quarter this year from 32.0% last year. Excluding the impact from Valspar, core SG&A increased $50.2 million in the quarter or 10 basis points as a percent of sales.", "Interest expense increased $47.5 million compared to third quarter last year to $91.6 million. This increase was entirely due to acquisition-related interest expense. Amortization increased to $83.7 million from $8.2 million last year due to the increase in intangible assets related to the Valspar acquisition. Consolidated profit before taxes in the quarter decreased $107.9 million or 20.1% to $427.7 million. Excluding the impact from Valspar, PBT declined $19 million or 3.3% to $553.4 million, which includes a $42 million negative impact from the natural disasters in the quarter.", "Our effective tax rate in the third quarter was 26.0%. For the full year 2017, we expect our effective tax rate will remain in that mid to high 20% range. Consolidated net income decreased $70.1 million or 18.1% to $316.6 million.", "Net income as a percent of sales was 7.0% compared to 11.8% in the third quarter last year. Diluted net income per common share for the quarter decreased 18.4% to $3.36 per share from $4.08 per share in 2016. The $3.33 per share includes a $1.42 per share in acquisition-related expenses including inventory step-up and purchase accounting amortization and income of $0.49 per share from Valspar operations. We have summarized the year-over-year earnings per share comparison in a Regulation G reconciliation table at the end of our third quarter 2017 press release.", "Looking at our results by operating segment. Sales for the Americas Group in the third quarter 2017 increased $154.7 million or 6.5% to $2.540 billion from $2.38 billion last year. This increase was primarily due to higher architectural paint sales volumes across most end markets, and selling price increases partially of set by the impact of the hurricanes primarily in our Southeastern and Southwestern divisions. Sales in the Latin America region stated in U.S. dollars, increased 4.9% in the quarter.", "Comparable store sales in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean, that is sales by stores opened more than 12 calendar months, increased 5.2%. Regionally, in the third quarter, our Canada division led all divisions, followed by Midwestern division, Southwestern division, Eastern and Southeastern division. Sales and volumes were positive in every division.", "Segment profit for the group increased $6.3 million or 1.2% to $525.6 million in the quarter as higher architectural paint sales volumes and selling price increases were partially offset by higher raw material costs and the negative impact of the storms in the quarter. Segment operating margin decreased to 20.7% of sales from 21.8% in the third quarter last year.", "Turning to the Consumer Brands Group. Third quarter sales increased $325.1 million or 81.6% to $723.3 million due primarily to the inclusion of Valspar sales, partially offset by lower volume sales to most of consumer group\u2019s retail customers. Excluding sales from Valspar, core sales for the group decreased 2.7% in the quarter.", "Segment profit per Consumer Brands decreased $16.8 million or 19.2% to $70.4 million in the quarter due to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization costs, totaling $54.6 million and higher raw material costs that were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, good expense control and selling price increases. Excluding the balance Valspar impact, core segment profit was essentially flat year-over-year.", "Segment profit as a percent of external sales decreased to 9.7% from 21.9% in the same period last year. Most of the impact in segment profit margin was from acquisition-related expenses, negative margin mix from the addition of Valspar businesses and higher raw material costs. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group increased 50 basis points to 22.4%. For our Performance Coatings group, sales in U.S. dollars increased $746.9 million or 150.8% to $1.24 billion in the quarter due to the addition of Valspar sales, higher core paint sales volume, and selling price increases. Excluding Valspar, core sales for the group increased 2.1% in the quarter. Stated in U.S. dollars, third quarter segment profit decreased $8.4 million or 12.4% to $59.6 million due primarily to acquisition-related inventory step-up and increased amortization costs totaling a $102 million. Excluding Valspar, core segment profit declined 15.9% in the quarter. As a percent of external sales, segment profit decreased to 4.8% from 13.7% in the same period last year. Excluding Valspar, core operating margin for the group decreased 240 basis points to 11.3% of sales.", "That concludes our review of the third quarter results for 2017. So, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John Morikis who will make some general comments and highlight our expectations for fourth quarter and full year. John?", "John Morikis", "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.", "Third quarter 2017 was a challenging quarter, particularly for those living in the path of the violent hurricanes and earthquakes we all witnessed. I think it\u2019s fitting that I begin my remarks this morning by acknowledging and thanking all the Sherwin-Williams associates in Texas, Florida, Georgia, the Caribbean and Mexico who served countless hours of volunteer work in the disaster relief and cleanup efforts, went above and beyond the call of duty in helping our customers get back on their feet, and got our stores and facilities up and running in record time. These communities are home to Sherwin-Williams and that point is very evident in the ongoing efforts of our people.", "Our results in the third quarter were slightly better than the revised expectations we communicated back on September 27th. Although the storms and earthquakes disrupted the operations of as many as 650 paint stores, the impact in terms of lost sales in the quarter was at the low end of our expected range of $50 million to $70 million. This good news, if you can call it that, was offset by moderately higher than expected raw material inflation as a result of storm-related supply interruptions, primarily in the Houston petrochemical complex. The combined effect of lost sales, higher raw material rates and LIFO charges taken in the quarter, decreased our third quarter consolidated gross margin by about 30 basis points.", "The hurricane disruptions also pushed our full-year estimate of industry average raw material cost inflation to the high end of our mid single digit range. The spike in some raw materials is likely temporary and should diminish as propylene and ethylene production returns to normal. Others may have a longer term impact. In either case, higher year-over-year raw material costs and LIFO will be a stronger headwind to earnings in fourth quarter than they were in the third quarter.", "The October 1st price increase in our North American paint stores should help to mitigate the impact of higher raw materials. Similar actions are underway as needed in our other lines of business.", "Natural disasters of this nature have a disproportionate effect on profitability because lost sales and gross profit cannot be offset in the short-term by reduced operating expenses. In total, these events decreased our earnings per share in the quarter about $0.27 compared to the $0.35 impact we anticipated at the end of September.", "The sales momentum we saw across most of our North American businesses prior to the storms, was encouraging. Comparable store sales growth in our North American paint stores was running in the high single digits, and that momentum appears to be resuming as the effects of the storms diminish. Even with the storm impact, sales to residential repaint contractors grew double digits in the third quarter, and DIY sales to our stores grew high single digits. Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group, both show sequential revenue improvement in the third quarter, and we expect that progress to continue as well.", "The natural disasters last quarter did not derail our plans for new store openings. In the first nine months, the Americas Group opened 50 net new stores and added 104 new sales territories in the U.S. Canada and the Caribbean, bringing our total store count in the region to 4,230 compared to 4,141 a year ago. Our plan for the full year still calls for store openings in the range of 90 net new locations in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean compared to 94 last year. In Latin America, we added 11 net new stores and added 44 new dedicated dealer locations in the first nine months. We currently operate 350 company stores and sell our products to 682 dedicated dealer locations compared to 316 and 619, respectively a year ago.", "Valspar integration plans and synergy progress continue to track with the expectations we communicated as recently as October 3rd at our financial community presentation.

And now, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "It\u2019s difficult to look at the Valspar numbers year-over-year because months of their quarter are different than months your months. Did the Valspar numbers -- did the Valspar volumes and price shrink in the quarter and is that what you expect for the fourth quarter? Can you frame what\u2019s happening in the year-over-year operations of Valspar?", "Al Mistysyn", "Hey, Jeff. This is Al Mistysyn. I would say, the Valspar performance in the quarter is really right where we expected it to be. We had a EPS guidance of $0.50, we came in about $0.49. So, the trend that you saw and the volumes which are holding up fairly well specifically on the Performance Coatings side, continued; and margin pressure that we\u2019ve been under also continued. So, both expected in the quarter and we saw that. In the fourth quarter, certainly, we will see some pickup in our pricing activities as our price actions roll in. We\u2019ll see some of that in our fourth quarter but we\u2019ll see more of that in our first quarter. And with sales being a little bit lower in our fourth quarter, that\u2019s why you see the impact of EPS in our fourth quarter, which we guided to $0.20 versus the $0.49 we saw in the third quarter.", "Jeff Zekauskas", "So, is Valspar growing?", "Al Mistysyn", "They are growing. Volume is growing and what we should expect to see and we\u2019ll guide this in our 2018 guidance is what the impact of the pricing will be in.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Yes. Good morning. Couple of accounting questions, if I may. First, you indicated in your press release that the purchase accounting inventory adjustment was a $115 million across June, July and August. Would I be correct in taking two thirds of that figure or 76 to $77 million for the impact in the third quarter? And if so, how would that be allocated among your segments, please?", "Jane Cronin", "Kevin, yes, that would be correct. You could take two thirds of that amount for the third quarter, allocated across the segments would be about $41 million in Performance Coatings in the quarter and about $34 million in Consumer Brands in the quarter.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Thank you for that. And then second, I noticed that you are now expecting incremental D&A related to purchase accounting of $300 million whereas, I think at your investor day, you were closer to $270 million, if my memory is correct. I was wondering if you could comment on what changed in recent weeks?", "Al Mistysyn", "Kevin, really, as we go through the process of the valuation, we are reviewing that really month-to-month to finalize what values are on trademarks, customer lists and that. And what we see in that increase is a little bit of a switch from goodwill to more finite life intangibles. And that\u2019s why you saw the increase. I don\u2019t expect it to change materially going forward, but if it does, we certainly would give you an update.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Arun Viswanathan", "Could you guys discuss a little bit more on the volume performance in the quarter in your outlook? I was just curious, in paint stores, you have a pretty decent showing versus the last couple of years on Q3. So, do you think that kind of mid single digit growth is sustainable?", "John Morikis", "Yes. We are pretty pleased with the performance of our stores. And if you look at that progress that we have made, we have mentioned this before, our pro business, we\u2019ll grow the pro business in our stores by 0.5 billion in the year. If you back out DIY and Protective & Marine. So, we are feeling pretty good about the momentum that we have in our stores organization. And that does, Arun, take into account also the storm. So, we talked about the momentum that we had going into the storm, we did take a short pause in the period of the storm. And then, as we mentioned, we feel as those pick right back up where we were running.", "Al Mistysyn", "And Arun, what I would add to that, in the fourth quarter, we guided sales mid to high single digits. And as you know, historically, what it tells you is our paint stores group will be in the high end of that range. We will have some price in there from October and November, but you certainly are seeing volume in that forecast as well.", "Arun Viswanathan", "And then, on coating, on Performance Coatings, what\u2019s your expectation on the cadence of margin recovery there? Do you expect these price increases to gain momentum next year? And ultimately, when do you think you can get that segment back to where it should be?", "John Morikis", "Yes. I don\u2019t think we are going to have to wait till the end of the year. Although the largest majority of it will likely come towards the end of the year. We are as we\u2019ve talked before, very determined in our efforts here in. And we are going to start seeing -- we will start to see some of that benefits here in the fourth quarter, largely after the first quarter. There will be some due to some agreements that may lag even into the beginning of the second quarter but the largest part we should see the recovery back in the first quarter of next year. But, we will see some here in the fourth quarter.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Evans", "This is Chris Evans on for Bob. I was wondering if you could tell us how pricing shaped up in the third quarter for paint stores group. And then, also in the third quarter, was pricing positive across much of Valspar portfolio?", "John Morikis", "Yes. So, in the price increase for stores, our paint stores realized about a 2.5% effective price increase in the third quarter this past year from the 3.5% -- 3, I\u2019m sorry, 3% to 3.5% price increase effective December 1, 2016. And Chris, we existed the quarter at a slightly higher run rate than that. So, implementation of our October 1st price increase here that we just announced is in progress. And we expect the timing and effectiveness to be similar to the December increase, roughly about nine months with 75% realization. It\u2019s fair to say, we\u2019re obviously experiencing some margin compression across most of our lines in our businesses, which really isn\u2019t unusual in an inflationary cycle, like we\u2019re experiencing, but our pricing philosophy in the other segments is basically the same. When we see raw materials inflate, we pass the increases to the market in the form of these price increases. And the difference in some cases in timing between the businesses, we\u2019re going to work with our customers to pass the raw material costs through in a manner that is least disruptive to their businesses. But, we\u2019re out there working every day, very hard to ensure that our customers are successful, and these discussions are going very well. We\u2019re working with our customers in a way that allows them to absorb that but we also are very firm in our need to get the price increase.", "Al Mistysyn", "Chris, I would just add, on Valspar, as we talked about on our second quarter call, Valspar had knocked out with price in the first half of the year. We talked about the six to nine-month lag that typically occurs in those businesses. And we\u2019re -- as John mentioned, we\u2019re out with price but we saw minimal impact on price in our third quarter as it relates to Valspar. ", "Chris Evans", "Great. And maybe just touching on the Consumer Brands a little bit. You mentioned in your paint stores group, DIY volumes were up high single digits. How did they fair out in the Consumer Brands division, maybe specifically in the big box retailer and then any other commentary you could give on how that division shaping up, would be helpful? ", "John Morikis", "So, first, to if you look at that business, let\u2019s say a business made up as you would expect of a number of different pieces and parts. And when sales were down, we mentioned that there were a number of elements or drivers behind this softness that we experienced, and so, as you would expect those number of drivers here there are leading the improved performance that we have here, most notably I would say would be our European business. In the past, we\u2019ve talked about that business was down in the high teens through the first half and that declined to mid single digits here in the third quarter. Some of this improvement would clearly be -- we have a more favorable currency comparison, but I\u2019d also say that our order volumes were better in the third quarter than the first half as well.", "Our national accounts business here, which is the largest customers segment that we have here, those would be the home centers, national hardware, other big box format, was essentially flat year-over-year in the quarter. That would suggest inventory adjustments by some of our larger customers were less prevalent here in this quarter that were just coming through. And while these signs are encouraging, as you would expect, we have higher expectations from our team. And while we are pleased with the momentum, we\u2019ve got confidence in this team, the leadership that we\u2019re going to continue to see momentum, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on, is making our customers more successful what they are trying to do.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I guess, sticking with the raw material theme, I know it\u2019s early, but can you give us a sense of how your raw material cost basket is tracking for 2018, based on what you know at current?", "Bob Wells", "Ghansham, this is Bob. We normally give the 2018 raw material outlook at the end of the year, simply because our vantage point is better at year-end, and that\u2019s particularly true here and the reason being that as you all know, Hurricane Harvey disrupted a meaningful amount of the global chemical supply sector, and that caused some short-term shortages and tightness in a lot of the feed stocks. The fact of the matter is at this stage, we don\u2019t know what short-term means. And moreover, there are some things we do know. We know that the availability of a lot of the monomers are improving but MMA in particular continues to be tight and is likely to be tight through 2018. We know that the global TiO2 market remained tight and that has facilitated price increase announcements in late second quarter, early third quarter and against the fourth quarter they captured a fair amount of the 2Q, 3Q increase. We\u2019re somewhat skeptical of their ability to capture the fourth quarter, but whatever they capture in second quarter, third quarter, obviously is going to carry into 2018.", "But the big question is, how much of the impact -- the short-term impact of the storms on the petrochemical sector are going to carry over into 2018 and we just don\u2019t know that yet. We think the raw material basket at this point is tracking year-over-year in about the 6 to 6.5% range. And if you assumed that raw materials were stable from here through 2018, that would put you in the low to mid single digit inflation range.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, Bob. And then, just as my second question, the $0.26 you called out for transaction and integration costs for the third quarter; where does that specifically flow through on a segment income basis? And also, at the analyst day, you called out $2.7 billion in EBITDA pro forma for fiscal year 2016, what does that number look like for fiscal year 2017 if you exclude the transaction and integration costs.", "Al Mistysyn", "The impact on the acquisition costs are flowing through admin, which would be about $187 million of that and the rest, the amortization inventory step-up that Jane talked about would be in the Performance Coatings Group and the Consumer Brands Group. When you talk about the EBITDA and looking out, the 2.6, which was the combined entity, if I look at core Sherwin, you\u2019re looking at an EBITDA of over 2 billion, 2.1, 2.2 billion. Valspar, historically has run about a $630 million, so a 2 billion plus the 600 gets you to 2.6. And right now, obviously I think you understand, we\u2019re running little bit behind that for partially here seven years but in 2018 you\u2019d expect us to pick that back up as the price increases that John talked about take effect and as the synergies flow through. And like I said, we\u2019ll give you an update on 2018 synergies on our year-end call.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna Financial. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson", "John, you mentioned that you\u2019ve maintained the midpoint of your guidance flat, it\u2019s $15, but obviously that\u2019s after $0.35 hit from the storms in Q3 and I assume some hit in Q4 as well. So, I guess versus where you were on your second quarter call, what\u2019s gone better than expected to offset or more than offset that storm impact?", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. Don, I think we\u2019d start with the sales momentum we saw in our U.S. and Canada paint stores. As we talked about in July and August -- coming out of July and August, we were running comp stores at 6.7%. As John talked about, coming out of the storms, we see that momentum continue along with the price increase that stores implemented and the effectiveness we are seeing that from October 1st; it\u2019s helping that. And obviously, Don, with the 22% increase on core; that tells you that we are expecting gross margins to improve sequentially third quarter to fourth quarter. So, it really -- that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving our guidance and why we feel strong about it.", "Don Carson", "Okay. Then just to clarify on paint stores group. You said John that price was about 2.5% of that 5.2% same store sales growth. What is it on a year-to-date basis? And how should that price unfold with the second initiative that you had another 3% to 5% increase on October 1st?", "John Morikis", "So, it\u2019s around that 2 to -- maybe speaking of 2.5, Don, but probably closer to 2, and we expect that rollout in this recently announced price increase to be very similar to what we have just experienced.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve Byrne", "Couple of questions on Consumer Brands segment. Would you say you have more potential to push price in these legacy Valspar brands than in legacy Sherwin brands? And then, in Lowe\u2019s, what can you offer them to maintain that combined sales base of the Sherwin and Valspar brands? Does it need to be rationalized? And what would you do to avoid a shelf space shift to a competitor?", "John Morikis", "Steve, what we look at constantly is our ability to help our customers meet their goals, as I mentioned earlier. And so, when you ask, what is it that we might do? It\u2019s helping our customers to be more successful. We are having discussions with them on a regular basis, not just Lowe\u2019s but every customer that we have. That\u2019s our path to success, is making our customers successful. Regarding price, we don\u2019t talk about price outside of our own stores. We have discussed the fact that we have clearly seen the raw material basket move and so that we\u2019re out talking with customers in all segments of our business about the need to push pricing in but we are not going to talk about any pricing and any specific customer. But I\u2019m going back to your point of what is that we do with our customers, as Lowe\u2019s or any other customer that we have on that side of the business is to help them be successful.", "Steve Byrne", "And do you have aspirations to penetrate the other big box retailer out there?", "John Morikis", "Well, again, we have discussions with our customers on a regular basis. We are not going to talk about any one customer. But our goal is to clearly understand what our customers\u2019 expectations are. We got terrific brands, products, people and services. And if we can help demonstrate to them an ability to help them reach their goal, then, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019re rewarded.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Chris Parkinson", "Can you just talk a little more about the regional housing trends you saw in PSG, especially as it appears some other regions offset some of the September weakness in Texas and the Southeast? And then, you\u2019ve seen a few housing markets with lower short-term availability but some higher prices. Can you just reconcile your own views on home prices versus turn over trends? Thanks.", "Bob Wells", "Yes. Chris, this is Bob. I would say that despite the fact that turnover has been slow due to lack of available inventory, remodeling has been very strong. I mentioned at our financial community presentation that as much as 20% of the residential repaint has historically been driven by existing home turnover. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s true at this point in this cycle. We think a higher share, the remodeling activity is being done by stay in place home owners and driven at least in part by rapidly rising home equity. While we would like to see more inventory available, we would like to see stronger turn over, it doesn\u2019t seem to be dampening the rate of residential remodel and repaint activity.", "On the new residential side, it\u2019s been a really pretty strong story, despite the fact that there are constraints to the market in labor and land availability. Single family starts are up about 9% year-to-date and completions are up a little more than that, new homes sales are up high single digits and home builder orders at least as of the second quarter were into the double digits. So, the new residential market of which we have substantial share is driving significant growth. Even in non-residential and I know you didn\u2019t ask about that but non-residential, we\u2019ve been seeing mid to upper single digit growth in starts, in square footage under construction and a little stronger than that in completions. So, all of the drivers of our paint stores group pro business appear to be, I wouldn\u2019t say firing on all cylinders but certainly strong enough to drive the kind of volume growth that we\u2019re seeing.", "Chris Parkinson", "Great and just a quick follow-up. There has recently been a little more optimism within some, let\u2019s say, key general industrial parallels within the legacy Val portfolio. Have you actually seen some improvements or would you just characterize yourselves as still cautiously optimistic? Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Are you talking about the Valspar general industrial?", "Chris Parkinson", "Correct.", "John Morikis", "Yes. I would say, we\u2019re very positive. Our team -- our leaders that lead that team have really been very bullish about, not only the core Valspar business but the sales synergies of those two business coming together are really exciting. So, yes, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re feeling bullish.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Vincent Andrews", "Thanks. Maybe just following up on that and just looking at the Performance Coatings Group, your Sherwin profit was down a lot this quarter and your sales aren\u2019t growing as fast as they\u2019re obviously at Valspar. So, you talked about the synergies between the two business and some issue there, but what\u2019s it going to take to get the margins in better shape, assuming a lot of that\u2019s raw materials?", "John Morikis", "Yes. It is raw material. And so, pricing is going to be an issue. If you look at our year-to-date margins, they are much more respectable. We had some pressure in the third quarter. And as we talked about, while we don\u2019t call out specifics with any specific customers, I would tell you that this is an area where our raw materials have moved and we\u2019re out talking to our customers to get the increase. But as Al mentioned earlier, I think it was Jeff Zekauskas\u2019 question regarding volume of the Valspar and our core business. Our volume in this business is very good, it\u2019d be a different story, if we had volumes stream in the other way, but we\u2019ve got volume. We just need to be able to get the price to offset the raw materials and we\u2019re feeling good about our ability to do that. As I mentioned, the discussions have largely taken place; it\u2019s a matter of timing before we start to receive it.", "Vincent Andrews", "And then, maybe just on -- and it\u2019s small for both companies, but the auto refinish business there\u2019s been some noise out there amongst the competitive set, just challenges with distributors and pricing issues, is there anything unusual going on in your business, related [ph] to that business core?", "John Morikis", "Yes. I wouldn\u2019t call that out in any negative way at all. We\u2019re out having pricing decisions there, we\u2019re working hard again to help our customers be successful. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything I\u2019d call out that\u2019s unique about that business right now.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mike Harrison with Seaport Global Securities. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Harrison", "In the paint stores group, if I take your 6.5% number for July and August, and then look at the overall performance for the quarter. It looks like September may have been 2 to 3% same store sales growth month overall. Is that about right and can you walk through what those same store sales numbers look like across the different U.S. regions or North American regions, in the month of September?", "John Morikis", "I\u2019d say directionally, you\u2019re heading in the right direction. And I don\u2019t know that we give specific numbers by region, Mike. But, I\u2019d say that if you back out the storms, our Southeast, Southwest divisions have really been lighting it up and little bit of competition between the two of those to see who can lead the race, but all of our divisions including Canada, all of them are doing very well. Look at the progress that we\u2019re making. We talked about this last year when we were coming out of the second quarter that we were really focusing on new account activity and on share of wallet penetration. And I know we talked about this when we were together that that\u2019s really been a focus. And we are absolutely witnessing the benefit of this program. Our leadership teams there and our teams in the field are really executing, and we\u2019re feeling really good. So, I wouldn\u2019t call out any one division as lagging outside of the storm impact.", "Mike Harrison", "All right. And then you mentioned the residential repaint business up double digits. Does this mean that contractors have been able to add some labor and expand their capacity during the high season? And then, what does that mean for the same store sales growth as get into the low season or the slower season where we have kind of seen better same store sales growth over the past couple of years in the Q4, Q1 quarters? Thank you.", "John Morikis", "So, the momentum that you\u2019ve talked about, I believe this will be the 15th quarter of double digit gains in the residential repaint. And so, we are continuing to capture we believe a little more than our share. I lost the last part of your question though...", "Bob Wells", "On the lower ends of our sales curve. So, Mike, I think what you\u2019re going to see is that you saw it in our first quarter, we had a 7.5% comp on top of a 9.4% comp in the first quarter of 2016. And as our guidance suggests, mid to high single digits will tell you that our U.S. paint stores have to be in the high end of that range on top of 5.5% comp last year. So, we definitely are seeing higher percentage increases in our off quarters, if you will.", "Operator", "The next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts", "As we model the cash flow, the capital spending was only $60 million in the quarter that annualizes I think to a much lower rate than either pro forma or regular target is on an annual basis. Could you comment about why it was so low and maybe what the next couple of quarters look like or next year?", "Al Mistysyn", "John, I think our CapEx for this year will be about $200 million to $210 million. What you see is, it is a little bit lower run rate. As we get to the facilities and understand more about what they are doing, their capacity utilizations, we have talked about having capacity utilization, architectural in the Valspar sites. So, you won\u2019t see us spending capital for capacity expansion that maybe we have over the last few quarters. I would say, we are really working on 2018\u2019s plan and we will give you an update at our year-end call. But, I still think we are going to be in the target of 1.6% to 2% is still a good target. And like I said, we are working on the 2018 plan and we will give you an update.", "John Roberts", "And then, in the back in the reconciling slide, you got the operating segment comparison and Valspar coatings was up 8.5% year-over-year in there, something must have been up double digit, now was packaging coating or coil coatings in major areas, up double digit in that Valspar coating segment?", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. We saw some nice progress in general industrial, John talked about the bullish outlook we saw, also some nice movement in our industrial wood business, and that\u2019s specifically in Asia. So, yes, across the board, we saw increases but those would be the ones that kind of led the way.", "John Morikis", "Yes. I\u2019d say, the wood business was certainly strong in Asia, but having just spent some time with our wood team at the market here, I would say we are starting to see some nice progress in number of parts of the world, not only Asia. We have some good momentum there.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor", "I wanted to ask about DIY within the stores. I think you called out high single digits, John, and I think that\u2019s the strongest DIY number you turned in four or five quarters. So, is there anything unique there or just curious f you could elaborate?", "John Morikis", "Scott, actually, if you look at the performance that we had in DIY throughout -- actually through 2016, we are in the mid single digits throughout the quarter. First quarter this year, we were up mid single digits. It was actually the second quarter of this year, we are actually flat, second quarter, and then as you mentioned here in the third quarter, high single digits. Some interesting parts there, we\u2019re always trying to keep our fingers on the pulse to know exactly how the consumers acting and why. And I wish I was smart enough to know exactly why they are but we do know that there are some economic factors that might drive home owners to hire a painting contractor. We talked about those. Those could be driving the same thought process and to driving consumers into a specialty paint store where they want a high quality finish, and they may not want to reach all the way down to painting contractor to do the work but they want to try to get as close to the finish as possible, and so they are turning to a specialty store like ours, where the quality of products and services will help them reach that.", "Bob Wells", "And Scott I would just add to that that the real difference between the mid single digit growth that we saw all last year and the upper single digit growth we saw in the third quarter was price. Volume growth was pretty consistent. ", "Scott Rednor", "And Bob, just also on the P&M that flows through the paint stores, is that now trending positively?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, it actually is. In fact, we commented that we\u2019ve seen that business go positive early in the year, in the first and second quarter. It continues to show -- to build momentum through the third quarter. Our third quarter was stronger than second quarter. We credit that to both our success in as we called it pivoting to key markets that are showing growth like bridge and highway, water and waste water and some of the others, and improving conditions in the end markets that have been in steep decline, particularly oil and gas. And I should point out that our Protective & Marine business was also positive in Latin America in the third quarter.", "Scott Rednor", "And then, just quickly, Al what are you taxing the amortization and integration cost at? I assume it\u2019s a little bit higher than the tax rate across entity.", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. It\u2019s about 30%.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "All my questions have been answered, but you guys have expanded your presence outside of the U.S. So, maybe it\u2019s worth revisiting, what the foreign exchange impact has been on the revenue, both in the Latin American Group as well as in the Consumer Brands and in the Performance Coatings. I\u2019m assuming there is not much change in the Canadian dollars, so this shouldn\u2019t be much of an impact in the paint store group.", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. Dmitry, you\u2019re correct. It\u2019s very -- it\u2019s minimal across tag. It\u2019s really basically flat or not -- no impact on Latin America and we had a 1.5% tailwind in Performance Coatings.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. So that\u2019s helpful. And in the consumer group it was also flattish?", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes, really no impact.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Because I know you picked up some Australian and Chinese and UK business with Valspar\u2026", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. The impact on Consumer Brands was really related to the devaluation of the pound related to Brexit, and we\u2019ve annualized that. So, in the quarter, there has really been no impact on Consumer Brands.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Got it. Okay. If you look at your Latin American profitability, it\u2019s kind of been all over the place. And I\u2019m just wondering in both in interest of understanding what\u2019s going on in the business and then sort of forward forecasting. How much of that profit variability has been a function of volatile foreign exchange where you just -- you price a product and then the currency moves on you or how much of it has been sort of either difficulty in growing the business or perhaps raw material inflation that was outsized for some period? There just doesn\u2019t seem to be a lot of reason to the quarterly performance on the margin side of that business.", "John Morikis", "Yes, Dmitry. It\u2019s largely to your point than impacted by the raw material costs. We\u2019ve had TiO2 coming in from Asia that has spiked up. So, when you would expect to have some benefit, maybe from FX standpoint, you get the impact of rising raw material costs coming into the market as all products coming in there for the most part have come in at a higher price this year. So that\u2019s largely been in the impact.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "So, if I\u2019m looking at sort of the profitability of that business quarter to quarter, you seem to put up kind of positive profit margin for most quarters but then we had a big 9% decline or so, or my math\u2019s -- a negative margin in the second quarter of this year, which correspond to about a 7% decline or 7% negative margin in the second quarter of last year. So, is that just a second quarter thing that you would put up a negative margin within a good year?", "Al Mistysyn", "No, we don\u2019t\u2026", "John Morikis", "We don\u2019t allow negative things\u2026", "Al Mistysyn", "No, I think Dmitry, you definitely -- as specifically Brazil, which is over half of our business and the economic issues they\u2019ve had, as that continues to get better, we will see choppiness in our quarters. But, our expectation is that we will continue to improve over the midterm certainly and get the business back to profitability on a more consistent basis, so you don\u2019t see these quarter to quarter swings.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Got it, got it. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, final question on the -- I know you guys can\u2019t talk about it explicitly, but PPG did say on their call that they\u2019re working with their big box partners to try to move pricing, given what\u2019s going on with raw materials now for the second year in a row. Is that something that you -- I\u2019m assuming you have the same initiative and we should start thinking about perhaps a little bit of a positive price in the DIY channel, not just Company-owned stores?", "John Morikis", "Dmitry, I\u2019ve broadened it across the entire Company. I\u2019ve tried to be very clear with this that it\u2019s a very good question and one that we\u2019ve tried to be as open as possible. And that is that we try every day to bring value to our customers. And when the raw material basket has moved like it has, we\u2019re in front of our customers talking about the need to stay whole in that, and that\u2019s across all customers, all segments.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Mike Sison", "In terms of 2017, you gave us core EPS with Valspar and on [indiscernible] $16.57, your guidance to midpoint 15, what does that imply for EPS with Valspar in a whole for 2017?", "Al Mistysyn", "If I understood, Mike, you\u2019re talking about our full year guidance at $15 with Valspar. Valspar will contribute about $0.80 to that and the guidance, and then that tells you that our core or legacy Sherwin EPS at $14.20 would be up 10.5% compared to last year\u2019s $12.85, if I answered your question correctly.", "Mike Sison", "Just relative to the $16.57, which you gave at the analyst day, which is annualizing Valspar for the full year, what does that number equate to for 2017, based on your $15 guidance?", "Al Mistysyn", "It\u2019s very hard to give you that number based on guidance when you\u2019re talking about all the puts and takes and the impact that Valspar has on pricing and the raw material inflation. So, what I would tell you Mike is that we\u2019ll give you an update for the full year 2018 with Valspar and we can kind of give you an impact certainly, the interest expense on the new debt impact. So, it\u2019s hard to get a comparable 2017 versus 2016.", "Mike Sison", "Okay. And then, just a quick question on October price increases. Does that cover potential inflation that you may see in 2018?", "John Morikis", "Well, it\u2019s certainly based on what we believe to protect us through 2018 but we are as determined as we can get it right, but we don\u2019t necessarily always know the future. I would say that we don\u2019t feel as we\u2019re in a similar market to what we experienced in 2010 through 2012 where if you recall, we were out with six price increases in 22 months. So, we are going in with what we believe will cover us. But, I think we have demonstrated through our past practices convection and determination to protect our shareholders.", "Bob Wells", "I do think it\u2019s also important to point out that we were out communicating about our October 1st price increase with our customers before Hurricane Harvey made landfall. So, the impact on the petrochemical sector of the hurricanes that hit at the end of August and early September were not contemplated in that price increase. But, as I indicated earlier, we think a lot of that -- the cost increases as a result will be short-term in nature and we will just have to see how 2018 unfolds.", "Operator", "Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Mushkin", "A lot of my questions actually have been answered but I wanted to broaden out a little bit. At the analyst day, you guys were really pretty bullish about the outlook and I just wanted to [indiscernible] obviously took place a long ago. But I just want to see kind of gauge or temperature about a month later and still feeling it\u2019s bullish in general about your business and the outlook going forward. And I suspect maybe answer is yes. And then, as you look at it and again over the next year or two as you bring these two companies together, what\u2019s your biggest concern both, from a macro perspective and then also internally to the things we trip up. So, two-part question here.", "John Morikis", "Scott, so, I would say, nothing has changed about our view of the world. Any bullishness that you felt continues and we feel -- I would say this way that we are more bullish than ever on this deal from both the strategic standpoint and from a synergy standpoint. This transaction is value-creating on many levels. And we are thrilled with where we are. We are thrilled with the people. We are thrilled with the products. And most importantly, we are thrilled with the customers. So, we are very excited about where we are and where we are going. The second part of your question was concerns and what might\u2026", "Scott Mushkin", "Not even specific to deal, the outlook looks really bullish on the deal. As you guys look out, what do you worry about though? Is it cost inflation that\u2019s your biggest worry? I guess, I\u2019m just trying to -- both Valspar in mind but also in general.", "John Morikis", "Cost is something that we deal with. We don\u2019t like to deal with it. But, as I just mentioned on our last call that I think we have demonstrated an ability to put price in where we have to. I would say, the macro shock to the economy or some disruption of some sort that would really impact the economy on a larger scale. But right now, if you would speak to any leader inside our company, we have got a strong line of where we are going, what we are trying to do and a lot of determination to be able to do it. And that gives us confidence that we control our future and we are focused on executing to be able to win.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of PJ Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.", "PJ Juvekar", "We know that the DIY market is weak. Are the big boxes trying to getting more contractors in the stores and are you seeing more competition from that side? And then, you talked about the shortage of contractors in the U.S. for last couple of years. Are you guys doing anything proactively to address that issue?", "John Morikis", "So, I would say, first, your question about the home centers activity and to the pro business, I would say that that\u2019s always been an element of the market and one that we respect. I would say that with our customers and the focus that they have on sub-segment of that pro business where we can help them, we are determined to help them do that. In many cases, those are remodelers that are no typically in our stores and if we can help our customers to grow that business, we want to try to help them. ", "Bob Wells", "On the labor shortage. ", "John Morikis", "On the labor shortage, it\u2019s interesting, the largest percentage of the business that feels the labor restriction is in the new residential, commercial and industrial business. Some in the residential repaint but again given our 15 quarters of double-digit gains, I would say that many of our customers are finding a way to find the labor that they need. In those other areas, while we\u2019ve been working with a number of areas to try to generate more supply of labor, the reality is, is that if in fact we were successful and we could find painting contactors or labors that could help our painting contractors. In many cases, they would still be on the job waiting, waiting for the drywallers to finish, the roofers to finish, I mean electrical, it\u2019s a much more macro issue than just the painting contractors themselves, the much larger issue. And so, while we\u2019re trying to help in a meaningful way, it\u2019s a bigger issue than just the painting contractors.", "Bob Wells", "I would add to that that for decades, we\u2019ve been helping contractors with labor issues by creating products that make them more productive. And it has been the focus of our R&D effort for a long time, is to get contractors on and off the job faster; that also helps in cycles where they are labor constrained. Using more productive products and formulas can help them do more jobs in less time. ", "John Morikis", "As well as less of a requirement to come back, touch up better or be more consistent in what they are trying to do to help them get off the job quicker as well. So efficiency and stay off the job. So, it\u2019s good point, Bob.", "PJ Juvekar", "Thank you with that. And just lastly, how much benefit could you possibly see in 2018, from all the reconstruction that would take place in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico, which are all your core markets?", "John Morikis", "It\u2019s really hard to quantify that. Different types of storms and different areas were affected in different ways. In Florida, while we really took a substantial hit in the number of stores that were closed, there was some flooding. In some areas, we don\u2019t want to minimize this at all; our hearts go out to those that are affected by the storm. Fortunately, many of the areas were impacted with some water damage that could be fixed relatively quickly and then there were others that were significantly and more horrifically damaged. And those will be a longer term cycles to get back up. In Texas and in Puerto Rico, there was more damage. A smaller market, while those areas will build themselves back up and we want to help those communities, our employees and those that live in that area. It\u2019s not going to be significant enough to move the needle. And so, we\u2019re going to be there to help in any way we can but we don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be something that\u2019s going to really drive our results.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Eric Bosshard", "Thank you. On the consumer segment, I appreciate the progress and growth results in 3Q relative to Q2. But thinking about the path forward for growth in that business and I heard the comment on some efforts on price but what are you doing and what should we be thinking about in regards to the growth out of that piece of the business?", "John Morikis", "Yes. So, Eric, as you would expect, we\u2019re engaged with our customers; that\u2019s not something that we lay out typically in a call like this. What you should expect is that those discussions take place regularly. We\u2019ve got we believe terrific assortment of technologies, people and service to help our customers win but from a strategic standpoint, we don\u2019t want to lay those out here today.", "Eric Bosshard", "In terms of the destination with growth, is there is a goal or\u2026", "John Morikis", "Eric, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t hear you.", "Eric Bosshard", "Yes, sorry. In terms of the destination with growth in that business, can you give us a little bit more there? I understand the strategic piece of it, but in terms of like what growth out of that business are you looking to get back on a sustainable basis?", "John Morikis", "Yes. I\u2019d say, we\u2019ve spoken that that business could be a low single digit growth run for us and we feel we can capture that. And quite frankly, talking to our teams our expectations are going to be higher than that. But we feel as though there\u2019s a lot that we can bring there. And we\u2019re really excited about the combined company and the assets, brands. There\u2019s a lot that we can accomplish we think. There\u2019s a lot of institutional knowledge on both sides of our company now coming together that we\u2019re going to try to leverage.", "Eric Bosshard", "But then secondly and you talked about a bit but just that level of conviction on improving the Performance Coating margin through pricing. Again, I know you\u2019ve only had the Valspar piece of the business for a period of time, but the confidence level of being able to make that happen as we go into 2018, where do you stand on that?", "John Morikis", "I\u2019m not sure how to convey the conviction or confidence any higher than -- we\u2019re going to get that Eric. We\u2019re out there having those discussions right now. We don\u2019t expect ever to just have something that we don\u2019t deserve. We\u2019re working hard. We\u2019re working hard to improve the quality, the availability, service, people, every element of our job there. And those discussions have taken place in many cases and it\u2019s the matter of timing. There are some that continue in dialogue and discussions but the largest part, those discussions have been resolved. And as I mentioned, you should start to see some of that in the fourth quarter. But, the lion\u2019s share of it come in as we turn the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Rosemarie Morbelli with Gabelli and Company. Please proceed with your question.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "I was wondering if you could talk about the trend in architectural paint and other businesses you have in China following as a five-year big meeting by the heads of the country.", "John Morikis", "So, we feel as though in China, we have a terrific platform to continue to grow and perhaps even better leverage. We do feel as though the technology, as I just mentioned and I think that discussion may have taken as a more North American focused discussion. But, when we\u2019re looking at this consumer business where we talk about all the markets that we participate in now, so when you look at that market and the brand that we believe can be better leveraged, we are excited about supplying not only the technology that exists in our combined company around the world but there is a lot of institutional knowledge that we want to bring to that market as well and to take advantage of the opportunity that exist in the market. Our market share there, I\u2019ll just say, there are plenty of opportunities for us. So, we are working with our team to identify those assets that exist inside the Company that can help them better perform in the market.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And then looking at investor day, you increased the synergy level. And as you look at Valspar more closely, what is the likelihood that we will see one more bump in that particular projection? And will it take until the end of 2018 or do you think that you are getting your arms around all of the manufacturing facilities and what you can do or we could actually see it before year end?", "Al Mistysyn", "For the full year, let me just start that -- we talked about seeing about $15 million going through our P&L and we haven\u2019t come off that forecast. However, what you saw is increase in our forecast for cost to achieve synergies in 2017, which as John talked about it in his comments was the result of some facility closings we announced in our third quarter. We really won\u2019t see the benefit of those until late next year or early to 2019. But I would tell you we are going to increase our expected annual run rate synergies at least for this year to $160 million versus 106 that we had talked at the end of our second quarter. Your are probably going to have to wait until our year-end call to get an update on the $280 million run rate synergy that we talked about at the financial community presentation.", "Rosemarie Morbelli", "And then, lastly, if I may. Could you help me allocate the charges between cost of goods and SG&A as a [indiscernible] going into the different segments or an EPS basis?", "Al Mistysyn", "So, if you look at the cost to achieve and the acquisition or purchase accounting cost, you would see in the third quarter about $87 million of that was in gross profit, primarily related to the inventory step-up. And then, you saw the rest of it or about $119 million, $120 million in SG&A related primarily to the amortization expense on the intangibles.", "Operator", "Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. So, I would like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thank you, Jessie. As always, I will be available over the next few days to answer any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning\u2019s call. If you\u2019d like to be placed in the queue for a follow-up call, please call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001, and she will add you to the callback queue. Again that number is 216-566-3001.

Projects are underway in the Mid-Atlantic, Midwest and West Coast regions. Logistics is also an opportunity, and we're benefiting from reduced freight costs by synchronizing distribution routes between Sherwin and Valspar facilities.", "Revenue synergies are, perhaps, the greatest long-term opportunity. One example from Performance Coatings Group is the ability to leverage our legacy North American blending facilities to provide color matching on smallbatch production of some key Valspar industrial products, one example being coating for metal extrusion customers.", "The ability to run high volume and smallbatch jobs is helping us to expand our share of wallet with existing accounts and attract new ones.

Due to the increased uncertainty in forecasting the exact timing of synergies and integration expenses, we've elected to suspend quarterly earnings per share guidance for the foreseeable future.", "For the full year 2018, we also expect core net sales to increase a mid to high single-digit percentage compared to full year 2017. In addition, we expect incremental sales from Valspar in the first five months of 2018 to add approximately $1.6 billion to consolidated revenues. But our earnings outlook is tempered somewhat by persistent industry-wide raw material cost inflation, likely to be up in the 4% to 6% range for the industry in 2018, possibly even higher in the first half.", "With these factors in mind, we anticipate diluted net income per common share for 2018 will be in the range of $15.35 to $15.85 per share compared to $18.67 per share earned in 2017.

We're excited that Pete take the range of The Americas Group and expect a seamless transition.", "Again, I'd like to thank you for joining us this morning, and now we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Ghansham Panjabi with Baird. Please proceed with your question.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Hi, guys. Good morning.", "John Morikis", "Good morning, Ghansham.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Morning. First off, on the mid to high single-digit core sales growth for 2018, can you break that down across your operating segments? Clearly, it's led by Paint Stores Group, but what about volume expectations more broadly for consumer and Performance Coatings as well?", "Allen Mistysyn", "Sure, Ghansham. This is Al Mistysyn. I would start by talking about U.S. and Canada stores continue to be the primary driver of our sales growth. And in the past, as we've talked about guidance, we've always talked about that group being in the high end of our guidance. So you expect them to be in the high end of that mid to high single-digits.", "As you know, we announced the 3% to 5% price increase effective October 1. And through the first four months of that, we're seeing effectiveness that's similar to what that we've seen in the price increase in December.", "From a volume standpoint, I think, across the company, we're going to see low single-digit volumes across each of the groups and, I would say even in consumer. I think we're optimistic about consumer coming off a pretty soft year. We have better comparables.", "We have some good momentum in different pieces of our business, and we do expect to turn around there. And then, I think, price should be approximately 2%. And then the last thing would be, FX really has no impact on sales planned.", "Ghansham, while we're talking about guidance, I'd like to talk about our EPS guidance also. So the midpoint of our core EPS guidance is an increase of 20% versus - excluding acquisition-related costs versus pro forma full year 2017 results. In 2018, we're seeing incremental raw material inflation. Our interest expense is increasing on the Valspar acquisition debt and on our core Sherwin debt as we've increased our liquidity sources.", "We're more than offsetting these headwinds with incremental synergies of $140 million to $160 million expected to come into our P&L, a reduction in the effective tax rate that we talked about on the prepared comments, but we're taking an opportunity here to take a portion of those savings and reinvest them back in our business for future growth.", "We'll take the same robust and prudent approach to investments that we do with - through our normal operations, but we do believe it's an opportunity to help accelerate our growth going into the future. And I believe this puts us on a path to achieving the 2020 financial target that we set at the investor community.", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Okay, that's helpful. And just a second question, can you just give us more granularity on raw material pricing? Which raw materials are you seeing the most incremental inflation within? I think, last quarter, you pointed towards low to mid single-digit raw material inflation. Now kind of 4 to 6. Just some more granularity on what's driving that? Thanks so much.", "Allen Mistysyn", "Yes, Ghansham. Last year, the story was a little simpler because most of the inflation was behind TiO2. This year, we expect pressure across multiple raw material categories. Crude oil is up 55% to 60% year-over-year. A January spike in propylene pricing due to supply constraints has been in the $0.05 to $0.08 per pound.", "We expect additional risk to propylene in February. This takes a little while to work its way through the acrylic chain, but it's already affecting product categories like solvents and packaging. We do also expect continued TiO2 supply constraint, and it's resulted in our first quarter 2018 price announcement or price nomination by all the global producers. Higher year-over-year - high-density poly propylene pricing is already affecting our packaging costs.", "And then in the first half, we commented that inflation could be higher in the first half. That's simply due to last year's raw material inflation trajectory. Comparisons were - pricing was lower in the first half, higher in the second. So comparisons get easier as we go through this year, but as we said, we expect average for the year to be in the 4% to 6% range, and it's across a lot of different categories. ", "Ghansham Panjabi", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Arun Viswanathan of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Tom Narayan", "Hi. Thanks guys. Good morning. It's actually Tom for Arun. Just following up on Ghansham's question on raws. Which segments should we see most impacted by the specific raws? And on a net basis for 2018, will raws be a net headwind with your pricing that you're going to put through? Just trying to understand the EPS guidance. It seems like raws is kind of the biggest new factor, perhaps, that maybe some of us weren't putting in our numbers.", "John Morikis", "Yes, Tom. On the first part, and I'll pass it off to Al after the raw material question, but on the first part, the TiO2 increases that we saw last year affected mostly the architectural paint businesses, which are mostly in The Americas. This year, with more pressure behind the petrochemical side of the basket, it is going to affect the industrial coatings categories as well. And so I would look for raw material pressure across the entire business this year. ", "Al Mistysyn", "And Tom, I would say, as in past cycles of raw material inflation, our gross margin may contract a little on the short term as the price increase still pursue and the effectiveness improves. But in the long \u2013 over the long term, we expect our margins to recover. And the guidance that I talked about, the 45% to the 48% long-term gross margin range, I still feel pretty good about that.", "The one thing I will remind you, and we've talked about this on the last couple of calls, is Valspar is really one price increase behind. Although we're \u2013 we believe, or we should feel confident about the price that's going through right now, as raw material inflation continues, we're going to be chasing that price on the Valspar side. ", "John Morikis", "Yes. I'd add to that, that the \u2013 if you look at the core business, to Al's point about the Valspar business, if you look at our core, SW consolidated gross margins, we're only down 80 basis points for the year, and then we're up 10 basis points in the fourth quarter. We wouldn't have been able to do that if we weren't able to achieve the pricing.", "So to Al's point, the Valspar pricing initiatives that we've been talking about basically since we closed, we said that was going to take six to nine months. It's actually tracking exactly as we have expected. We're starting \u2013 in the fourth quarter, we started to see the pricing move in, and we expect now, as we've changed the calendar first of the year, that more and more of that is going to roll in. So it's actually going exactly as we projected. ", "Tom Narayan", "Great. And then my follow-up on Paint Store Group. Really strong performance. Just curious if we should expect any kind of tough comps in 2018 on same-store sales. And additionally, if there would be a cadence issue with the labor issues that typically happen in Q2, Q3. Or is this kind of like some new normal happening in U.S. housing in 2018?", "Bob Wells", "Yes. I would start with, Tom, as you pointed out, there is a tough comp in our first quarter. We're up \u2013 same-store sales were up 7.5%. But with the momentum we have coming out of the fourth quarter, and the volumes that we\u2019re seeing and the ability that we\u2019re talking to our customers and have a fairly good outlook, we feel confident that we're going to go over the top of that in our first quarter. And that's why we're talking mid-to high single digits, and we fully expect stores to be in the high-end of that range.", "John Morikis", "Yes, we've been talking about sometime about the initiatives that we've had as far as growing share of wallet with our existing customers as well as opening new accounts, not only to overcome the comps, but also the point that you made a little bit later in your question about labor, making sure that we are filling that pipeline with enough new business to offset that.", "For the most part, I would say, I think we commented on this in the last quarter, in some of the metro markets, it's diminished a bit, the restraint on labor. But for the most part, we continue to see the same labor issues continue throughout the market. In fact, I might say that on the residential side, we're starting to see a bit of a backup in projects as labor for that side of the business has also become a bit tighter.", "Tom Narayan", "Understood. Thanks. I'll turn it over.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Steve Byrne", "Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you've been seeing any changes in wall-covering trends, either inside or outside of the home, that could affect architectural coating used for home versus historical levels, either positive or negative trends?", "John Morikis", "No. Steve, not anything to speak of. The wallpaper industry is one that has always cycled. I don't think that right now, we're experiencing much change at all. In fact, I'd say, through the blessing of many of the TV programs and shelter magazines that are out there, we actually like the frequency in which people are repainting.", "So we sell wall-covering, if it moves in that direction, we'd benefit from that. But right now, it seems to be more on the paint side, and we enjoy that.", "Steve Byrne", "And with respect to the legacy Valspar brands of architectural paint sold in China, are you seeing any potential upside from kind of benefiting from your own experience on selling paint through stores that you could leverage that experience in China?", "Allen Mistysyn", "Yes, that's a great observation, and we are excited about kind of bringing what the call best practices to all of our businesses around the world. Our leader, Ed Lorber, was just in China last week, a terrific leader. We're working on the transfer of that knowledge from our company to that business. We have a lot of those dealers surprisingly as I've gotten to know them, many of them has actually traveled to the U.S. to visit our stores trying to get an understanding of what we do and how they might transfer. So they're very receptive to that.", "As I said, many of them spend their own money trying to get here to see it themselves. So we're excited about bringing some of that best practice. We know that what works in the U.S. doesn't necessarily work everywhere, but we also know that what works in the U.S. might work other places. So we're not limited by if it works here, it has to be there. We're going to do what's right for every market.", "Steve Byrne", "Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Christopher Parkinson", "Great. Thank you. Can you just break down any key trends within Performance Coatings, specifically whether or not you saw broad-based volume strength and your expectation for general industrial coil? And then also, I think Allen hit on this a little bit, but just any quick, broad comments on pricing strategy on the legacy Val assets within PC and then longer-term potential as it applies to your multi-year margin targets? Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thank you, Chris. I'll take the first piece. Allen then maybe you can talk about the pricing. Regarding your question, Chris, about trends and what we're seeing, we are really excited. I mentioned in my earlier remarks about the opportunity to leverage the resources that we have now as a combined business.", "So Valspar's business in coil it was very good, very strong, terrific relationships and wonderful technology. We're really, I think, finding the sweet spot as we're working with our customers in our ability to respond quickly with small batch quick turnaround utilizing our facilities that are spread out throughout the world, primarily in the U.S., but we have them around the world.", "That gives us an opportunity to take care of their immediate demands just in time as well as continuing to provide them with the technologies that they've gotten to know over the years. Very well received by the customers, and we're excited about the future, being able to leverage that.", "Allen Mistysyn", "And Chris, on the pricing actions, yes, we will chase price in 2018, but we believe the effectiveness that seeing is going to be very good. And the reason part of why we believe that is although paint is a small portion of the cost of a customer's product, but it's an important part of it. Imagine looking at a Caterpillar tractor. The performance of that product is very important. So we believe we're going to get the price, but we're going to be chasing it throughout 2018.", "Christopher Parkinson", "Great. Thank you. And can you also just comment broadly on your expectation for any incremental industry M&A, your potential involvement in 2019 onwards? And any key strategic initiatives you see yourself undertaking in the intermediate to long term in terms of either enhancing or simply broadening out your end market exposure is? Just any broad color would be appreciated. Thank you.", "Allen Mistysyn", "So I'll take the first part on our ability to participate. One, I do believe, or we do believe that the industry will continue to consolidate. And when you look at our debt-to-EBITDA leverage at the end of 2017, we're around 4.1. Our expectation for that leverage at the end of 2018 will be around 3. So I believe that gives us flexibility, particularly in the second half of 2018, to pursue a strategic acquisition and one that fits our portfolio very well.", "John Morikis", "And as you would expect, we're not waiting for that point in time, Chris, to begin looking. Our teams are constantly revisiting what those opportunities might be. We look at geographic opportunities, we look at technology opportunities. And so to your question about, are we interested in enhancing or broadening our future opportunities through acquisition, the answer is definitely yes.", "Christopher Parkinson", "Thank you for the color.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.", "Don Carson", "Thank you. Question on going back to Paint Stores Group. Are you anticipating another price increase? Or is that second 3% to 5% that you put through on October 1 sufficient in your mind to deal with raws going up? And then if you grow at 8.2% same-store sales growth, 2% was price, does that put you at still growing at twice the market? Or what do you think the overall market is doing and will do in 2018 on U.S. architectural?", "John Morikis", "So on the first part of that question, Don, on the price increase that we have put in place as of October 1, we currently believe that it's sufficient to cover the raw material costs that we currently see. We monitor that on a monthly basis, and as we see movement, we evaluate whether another price increase is required, and we'll continue to do that throughout the first quarter and the rest of the year.", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. And in terms of growth pace relative to the market, Don, first, the tag effective pricing in the fourth quarter was a little north of the 2% that we said for consolidated. That still leaves us with volume growth in the range of what we believe is probably 1.5 times to 2 times the rate of the market. That's the range that we target. I don't think we have enough data yet to say exactly what the market grew in the fourth quarter, but we like the volume movement to our stores.", "John Morikis", "And our expectations will continue to be that same rate of growth, 1.5 times to 2 times over the market.", "Don Carson", "Just a follow-up on Consumer Group. Your segment comparison shows that, that was down 6.8% for the year on a year-over-year basis for the quarter. Were there any product line losses at any of your big-box customers that contributed to that? Or was it simply slowdown in DIY and de-stocking by those customers?", "John Morikis", "No, Don. There wasn't any loss. And I'll remind you, you know from last year, or this past year, as we've been talking about consumer and the weakness in consumer's really coming for many, many points. There's not a one area that we would to. Clearly, a challenging year. I might add, clearly not happy with that performance.", "But we also know that the comparisons in the fourth quarter, we're going - and we knew it was going to be a little more difficult, and we had to load in some of the business that went last year. And you're right. We had a lot of customers that were adjusting inventory appropriately so.", "As we look forward, though, and Al let mentioned about the opportunity in gallons, we're really excited about the team that we have here and the discipline that they have. We think the combined assets and brands that we have are very strong, and we're having wonderful conversations right now with our customers who are eager to grow. And so we having, we think, meaningful discussions about how we can help them reach their goals.", "So as we enter into 2018, it's with a lot of determination. We think we've got some momentum here that will show up here hopefully as the year proceeds and into 2018.", "Don Carson", "Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Grace Chen", "Hi. This is Grace Chen on for Vincent. Following up on consumer. Are there any specific strategic initiatives then? You say you're targeting as we head into the spring painting season maybe increased market spend?", "John Morikis", "Yes, there are a number of initiatives, none of which we really want to lay out. But when we talk about the fact that we've got a little confidence in fields that we have momentum, we are determined.", "And we don't think just doing the same thing over and over is going to change things. So yes, a lot of considerations that we have on the table, but as you would expect, we don't want to flush those out publicly here right now.", "Grace Chen", "Okay, that's fair. And then with the U.S. tax reform, the savings you'll see from that, do you have any specific plans in mind for that? Or do you expect it to generally flow through to EPS?", "John Morikis", "No, just like I opened with my comments on the first question, we absolutely are going to take the opportunity to reinvest a portion of those savings back into our businesses for future growth. And it's - we're looking at opportunities across all of our segments. And as I talked about, we'll go through the processing \u2013 robust process that we do with our other investments, but we view this as a real opportunity to accelerate our future growth.", "Grace Chen", "Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. ", "John Morikis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Hi. It's Kevin on for Matt. Before I ask, I just want to kind of clarify something quickly. If I'm looking at the slide decks, are the synergy numbers included in the Valspar portion of the segment breakdowns?", "John Morikis", "The way our synergies are flowing our \u2013 it's really in both our core and our core Sherwin and in our Valspar, but they would be embedded in any actual results that we report.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Okay. I was just wondering how they're being attributing, whether on the legacy Sherwin or Valspar basis. But it sounds like it's kind of both. But...", "John Morikis", "Yes, Kevin, you can imagine, as we consolidate the operations, as we consolidate departments, it's harder and harder to just separate the two between Valspar and the core Sherwin.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Okay. So if I look at slide decks, EBIT year-over-year for legacy Valspar looks it's down about $20 million, or about 15%, inclusive of synergies that are there and backing out any deal-related amortization. Just given the breakout, looks like most of that\u2019s coming from Performance Coatings, and margins look like they\u2019re down about \u2013 to about 13% from 17% last year.", "So I guess, the question is, where do you expect those margins will be by year-end next year? And how long do you think it would take to kind of restore those mid-high \u2013 high teens EBITDA margins that business used to enjoy?", "John Morikis", "Yes. We have talked about, we're not going to recover the raw material costs that we saw in 2018 and didn't get price for in a one-year window. So it is going to take us a little bit of time to recover those margins back to the way they were.", "That being said, we've talked about an increased run rate synergy number, both for the 230 at the end of 2017, and we increased our target run rate synergy for the end of 2018. We're going to recoup some of those that \u2013 recoup some of that margin in the increased synergies that we're going to see through the P&L. But if \u2013 absent synergies, we're going to be chasing the margin for a little bit of time here.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Okay. And then, I was wondering if you could provide a little context on the breakdown between pricing volume for same-store sales and PSG because if you had \u2013 would've been almost two price initiatives specifically on the quarter. I was thinking volumes maybe something like 2%. But you said Protective & Marine was up double digits, and resi repaint, I think, was up about double digits as well. So I'm just kind of wondering where the offsets were on that. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "I think your volume is going to be a little bit more than half of that 2, and then the rest will be price.", "Kevin McCarthy", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Nishu Sood of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Nishu Sood", "Thank you. I wanted to ask about the kind of rebound from the storm-related disruptions of 3Q. Obviously, two components to that. One is just the sales that couldn't that happen during the disruption happening, And then the rebuild proportion of that as well. What \u2013 now that we have a little bit more visibility on how that's likely to shape out, what specifically \u2013 if you could give a little bit more specific, did you see in the fourth quarter? And what are, what are you expecting as we see the painting season beginning here?", "John Morikis", "So if you look at Southwestern division, they were up double digits in the quarter, and Southeastern division was up high single-digits. Now what I'd also point out to is that those sales growth numbers in both of those divisions were strong prior to the storm.", "So it's very difficult for us to say how much of that was attributed to the storm. So we were running at a similar rate that we are running at now interrupted by the storm. So to attribute any one area of that to the storm would be very difficult.", "The other piece of this is as it came through, we had, I believe, it was nearly 100 stores in the southeast that at one point closed. More in the Southwest as those storms rolled in. While those stores are closed, it's not that we're not selling exterior paint. I mean, we are - our business is closed.", "So it was a significant drop. It seems as though it's rebounded back, and we are back to the levels that we were operating on prior to the storm. And as you mentioned, very strong performance. And this is the 15th consecutive quarter of resi repaint sales. And so we're feeling good about the momentum in all our stores.", "Bob Wells", "And just to reiterate John's point, we have seen particular strength in the southern region of the U.S. throughout the year.", "Nishu Sood", "Got it. Okay. Thank you. And in terms of your '18 outlook for mid- to high single-digit sales growth, what kind of growth assumption are you using for housing in '18? Are you assuming some acceleration, continuation of the momentum that we've seen in the second half of '17, and also how that would flow through to the repaint side of things?", "Bob Wells", "Yes, Nishu, the - we're basically tracking new orders and backlogs from all the public builders, and we are interpreting them as more or less high single-digits on average. We think that most of the forecast we're seeing for new sales and starts for '18 would be in the mid- to high single-digit range. That seems about right to us. It feels like the builders, the residential builders might be starting to pick up the slack in inventory in the existing home market by building new homes at a little faster pace. So we are expecting a robust market.", "I would also point out that we've been commenting for a couple of years about how home value appreciation is driving remodeling activity. We expect 2018 to be a really strong year in North America remodeling as well.", "So our outlook is not based just on new construction. Let me add to that, I know you asked about residential, but on non-residential, we're seeing an improving picture, too. 2018 - or 2017 was a positive year in square footage starts following two years of declines, and we're expecting a moderate - a modest acceleration in 2018 in non-residential starts.", "Nishu Sood", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "John Morikis", "You bet. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.", "Daniel Jester", "Hi, guys it's Dan Jester on for P.J. Just on Latin America, we haven't really talked about it much on the call today, but it's been tougher a couple of years now. Just wondering, if you go into 2018, is there any signs of optimism that, that business might turn around?", "John Morikis", "Yes, Dan, we continue to work down there. Our Southern Cone and Indiana region were the strongest performers for us down there. Some of those businesses are up double digits. The area that we're continuing to experience pressure in is Brazil. It's a big part of our business. And while we saw an increase in sales in Brazil, our volumes were still down slightly. So we're continuing - we're not waiting. I've said this time and time again. We're not waiting for the market to get better. We're working hard down there. I think we're gaining progress that, again, some terrific leaders down there that are working really hard, and we're going to keep pushing the ball here.", "Daniel Jester", "Okay. And then I just wanted to clarify something that you said on the new store openings. If I remember correctly, I think that you're planning on opening 90 new stores in The Americas this year, and it turned out to be closer to 100. So did you \u2013 I guess, first, is that number correct? And then did you pull forward any store openings? And if I look to the 2018 number that you talked about, that 100 to 110, if I go back just a few years ago, something like 140, so is there something specifically you're doing in terms of mix? Or just because of the focuses of the Valspar right now that not open quite as many stores? Thanks.", "Bob Wells", "Hi, Dan, I'll let John comment on the peak openings versus our run rate now. But as clarification, on the guidance that we gave on store openings, the 90 pertained to our U.S., Canada and Caribbean store base. We actually ended up opening 87 in the U.S., Canada and Caribbean. The 101 is all of tag. It's throughout The Americas. So it included all the openings in Latin America.", "John Morikis", "And regarding the run rate, I would say that we've kind of settled in at this 100 store opening rate. With that requires about 1,400 management trainees from \u2013 we recruit from college as we continue to add more districts, more areas. And it's an area that I've spoken with Pete Ippolito. He is an aggressive sales promoter, and he'll want to grow, and we want to support that.", "And so you could bet that when Al was talking earlier about our taking some of these funds that are going to be available for the tax program here going forward, that a big piece of this will go into our stores organization. But Pete's a smart investor and wants to grow our business, and we're going to support him. But I think you should see us continuing around that 100 base.", "Daniel Jester", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Dan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Robert Koort", "Great. Thanks for sneaking me in there. Al, I was wondering, you mentioned a little quicker capture of synergies and the costs to achieve those. Can you tell me how you got to a faster run rate specifically? And then what is the 2018 cost to extract those synergies?", "Allen Mistysyn", "Yes, Rob. Bob. The speed that we get is by vetting out the project and really validating the fact that we're going to see those benefits to the P&L. So it is going through each group, Performance Coatings Group and Consumer Brands Group being the largest that are impacted by the acquisition. It's also through corporate. And one of the ways we see the improvements is through system implementations. And as we've been able to turn some systems on as of January 1, we've vetted those savings and gave us the confidence to put them into our run rate and into what we expect in the P&L for 2018.", "Robert Koort", "That's helpful. And then curious, obviously, you guys have the ultimate mousetrap when it comes to contractor markets in the U.S. and how you serve those. As you started looking at the Valspar paint in Europe, in China, in Australia, have you come to any conclusions or confidence that you can sort of achieve the same sort of superior performance in those brands over time that you exhibit through your stores group in the U.S.?", "Allen Mistysyn", "We are continuing to evaluate what aspects of our business would make sense in every market. I think it's important, as I said, not to just assume because it works here that, that it'll work everywhere, nor assume that it works here so it can't work somewhere else.", "We're really trying to be very diligent in our research to understand what elements, what products, what technologies. We want to bring everything we can to the market to really differentiate ourselves in that market. By the way, I'm going to steal that. I like that ultimate mousetrap approach, too. We're going to brand our team with that, Bob. Thank you.", "Robert Koort", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Mushkin", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple from, I guess, tag answers this call got a little bit. You guys talked about being back in the market maybe for acquisitions. And I'm just wondering if \u2013 as you look over the portfolio, kind of what areas do you see some weakness in? And kind of get our minds around kind of what you think strategically?", "Bob Wells", "Yes. And so you'd really want to look at it business-my-business, and that's the way we talk with our general managers to understand. And I mentioned, we look at opportunities to differentiate ourselves in the market, and we think that part of that is having the product, service and availability in the right geographic areas. And we also look, from a technology standpoint, what opportunities there might be.", "I'd really rather not get into deeper than that, other than to say that this is an important part, we believe, in the very near future, we're going to spending a lot of cash off, and we want to put to work with our shareholders. We think this is an important element of our go-forward strategy.", "Scott Mushkin", "Okay, it's actually a pretty good fair remarks, I appreciate it. And then I guess, and maybe I missed it, you guys talked a lot about the expectations for commodities continue to go up. Can you share anything? I didn't think about maybe you guys putting through further price increases. I just want to get comments on that. Is that something that we should be thinking about?", "Bob Wells", "Scott, we did say that we believe the pricing that we have going into a sufficient for the current raw material inflationary environment, but we're monitoring that on a daily basis. And as you can imagine, it is an influx kind of a situation. So as a we see raw materials increasing more than what we think we've gotten in price, we'll talk to our customers, as our past practice has been, and then talk to The Street about what we're doing.", "John Morikis", "And Scott, just as a reminder, if you \u2013 I don't think we're anywhere near this environment, but if you do rewind the clock here and take a look at the time period between 2010 and 2012, we did go out during that period with 6 price increases. And I think what that demonstrates is the discipline that we have. As Al mentioned earlier, during even that period, there's a little bit of compression in the short period while we're looking through that - of those price increases. Then we go out and get it.", "And if that should represent anything, as our commitment to making sure we stay firm here, the idea that we have is always adding value to our customers, helping them reach their goals. And we believe that the value proposition that we bring provides us the opportunity to make sure that we capture the price. ", "Scott Mushkin", "Perfect. And then supply issues on TiO2, is that something that you're worried about or not really?", "John Morikis", "There's a number of reasons for TiO2 supply being tight. And we've got the major global producers of chloride kind of managing their capacity utilization to keep market conditions favorable. We have some shutdowns in production in China.", "So we don't necessarily believe its structural, meaning the industry is just chronically - it's structurally under capacity. But we do expect the market to be tight probably through the better part \u2013 certainly, the better part of the first half, if not the year.", "Scott Mushkin", "All right. Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.", "John Morikis", "Thank you, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Scott Rednor with Zelman & Associates. Please proceed with your question.", "Scott Rednor", "Hi, good morning, everyone.", "John Morikis", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott Rednor", "Question for Al. The $0.60 range in the core guidance, it's a little bit larger than in prior years, prior issuance. I was just curious, what's the biggest variable up or down there? Is it purely commodity? Or is there something else that we should consider?", "Al Mistysyn", "It's more the commodities. And you're going to have some variability in the timing of our synergies. We put a range out on what we expect incremental synergies to be in our P&L, and that's not an exact science on timing. So those will be the two main factors.", "Scott Rednor", "Okay, great. And then the cash flow, if we look at cash flow from operations to sales, it was right around 13%, which I think is one of the highest in company history. And it would seem to suggest that, that's ahead of your 2020 guidance, Al. Is anything unusual there? Or are you tracking ahead of that, that out year measure? ", "Al Mistysyn", "I would say, we had a very strong working capital year. Our core Sherwin working capital came in at 10% versus 10.7% last year. That's a bigger year-over-year change than I would expect going forward. So we got a little bit of wind, tailwind on that. So we're not going to change our 2020 outlook just yet, but certainly pleased with the cash generation. You look at it after CapEx, and we're over 11%. So strong performance, and we're going to keep pushing that as we get into 2018. ", "Scott Rednor", "Great. And then just one last one, was there any FX, and if there was by segment in the quarter on the sales side?", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. The overall FX in the quarter, and it's a little tough to look at because you've got Valspar in these numbers as well, but it was about 1% on the consolidated, and it was a tailwind. Nothing to speak of in TAG. Performance Coatings was a low single-digit impact, and then really nothing to speak of in Consumer. ", "Scott Rednor", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Scott.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Good afternoon, everyone. Al, could you maybe talk a little bit about the changed economics of paying down debt versus buying back stock with the tax reform and what we should think about after maybe the midpoint of this year? ", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes. Chuck, I think, the \u2013 certainly, the paying down the debt still is our first priority in the sense that getting our debt-to-EBITDA leverage down so that we have the flexibility to go after the strategic acquisitions that we talked about earlier, I think that's very important to us.", "That being said, in 2018, we're going offset dilution from options with buying back shares of our stock. I think as you get towards the second half, and we see what the progression is on our cash flow on our ability to pay down debt and, quite honestly, how our operations are going, we may put us in a position to get debt down a little bit lower and look to acquisitions. So we'll keep driving that debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio down so we feel comfortable that we have that flexibility.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "The third place is stock repo?", "Al Mistysyn", "That's right.", "Chuck Cerankosky", "Thank you very much.", "John Morikis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Truman Patterson with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Truman Patterson", "Hi, good morning guys.", "John Morikis", "Good morning Truman.", "Truman Patterson", "Quick question. This all pertains to your legacy Sherwin business, kind of excluding Valspar. I'm really looking at Paint Stores Group and consumer. So Paint Stores Group out margin only fell about two percentage points quarter-over-quarter, which is much better than historical, while your consumer fell about 10 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, which is much worse than kind of the historical relationship. Typically, these move a bit more hand in hand due to consumer capturing your global supply chain initiatives, et cetera. Can you maybe walk us through the dichotomy between the two segments and what's occurring there?", "John Morikis", "Sure. The first thing I would say is volume. As Paint Stores Group drives incremental volume, they get great leverage in that, and you saw that in our fourth quarter leverage on SG&A. As we get into the slower quarters, our SG&A headcount contracts a little bit.", "And so as we see that volume growth, we get great leverage on our SG&A. We did not see that same effect in our Consumer Group. The volumes were a little softer, and you're not seeing the leverage.", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes, that's almost the opposite side that we saw in the consumer side.", "John Morikis", "Declining line.", "Al Mistysyn", "Yes.", "Truman Patterson", "Okay. And then multi-part question, but it should be pretty short. For the fourth quarter, could you guys break out the charges and the synergies among your various segments as well as kind of gross margin versus SG&A? And then as we look into 2018, similar question is where is the $320 million in synergies broken out, at least on run rate, and then where are the $3.45 and EPS charges, where does that fall in 2018?", "Jane Cronin", "Sure, Truman. There was a number of puts and takes in the quarter around our purchase accounting. So if I just speak to the full year total, there was about $91 million of charges for purchase accounting and Cost of goods sold, about $28 million in SG&A and $183 million in amortization.", "And if I break that down by the Consumer Brands and Performance Coatings that we included in our release, of the $107 million for Consumer Brands, $49 million was cost of goods, SG&A was $4 million, amortization was $54 million. And for Performance Coatings Group, of the $183 million we reported out, $39 million was cost of goods, $16 million SG&A and $127.8 million in amortization.", "Al Mistysyn", "So if you look at 2018, the impacts by segment, Consumer Group will be, on the purchase accounting, $340 million purchase accounting group, Consumer Group will be about $102 million hit, small amount, gross profit, most of it being in amortization. And Performance Coatings Group will be about a $240 million hit. The vast majority again in that is the annualization of the amortization. We're really not going to talk about breaking down synergies by segment. And as you can imagine, it just gets all intermingled, and it's tough to do, and we really just don't want to talk about it by segment.", "Truman Patterson", "Okay. And if you guys don't mind me sneaking in one more, following up on the prior question, looking at Valspar's legacy Performance Coatings margin falling about 400 bps year-over-year, could you maybe walk us through \u2013 now that we're seven months into the integration, I know, previously, you guys had said that pricing would take about nine months to flow through. Could you maybe give us where we are today and the pricing enrollment to your own environment compared to maybe where your expectations whenever you first closed on the deal in the Valspar Performance Coatings?", "John Morikis", "Sure. As it relates to the Valspar performance, I'd say, we are \u2013 firstly, right where we expected to be. These are large customers, many of whom had agreements with the Valspar. And the last thing we wanted to do was go in day one and break previous agreement or almost the implied agreements that they've had in the past.", "Our goal is to get the price and retain the customer. And so we're working with our customers and, I think, preceding exactly as we expected. We had some of that rolling in the fourth quarter, and we talked about right from the start that it's going to be six to nine months. So as I said earlier, now as we go into the first quarter here, we expect even more of that to roll in.", "As Al mentioned, we're going to be chasing it here a little bit, but we're on it. Our teams are working hard and we are having terrific discussions. And I'd say, for the largest part it's about how the pricing is coming in, not if. And we're working hard to make sure that we're continuing to add value while we're having the discussions. But we're feeling good about our ability to get it.", "Truman Patterson", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "John Morikis", "Thank you, Truman.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dmitry Silversteyn with Longbow Research. Please proceed with your question.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Thanks for sticking around to take my calls \u2013 my questions, I should say. Just a real quick question. You mentioned in your press release, actually, that you're getting pricing up in the Consumer segment of your business. Can you provide a little bit more detail when the price increase went in and how you look at the DIY market and your pricing ability there in 2018?", "John Morikis", "Yes, Dmitry. I'd say, it's been rolling in \u2013 I really don't want to get into any specifics on that. I would say, as we stated, every one of our businesses is out there. I understand the question, but out of respect for our customers on this side of the business, I would just tell you that it's been rolling in, continues to roll in and will continue to roll in.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. Fair enough. Just a quick question on margins, I mean, I understand all the raw material and volume interactions, but if you just look at kind of how your margins of your businesses have done year-over-year, it's almost counterintuitive to what would with think you're maintaining margins your Paint Stores Group, in your Performance Coatings Group, which margins there will be most impacted by raw materials and slow price increases.", "But your Consumer Brands, which historically has been a little bit better than when it came to margins, and as a previous caller mentioned, benefits from the volume of the whole North American piece, saw the biggest year-over-year drop in margins and actually a pretty huge sequential drop in margins as well.", "So can you kind of talk about what's allowing you to maintain margins in the face of pretty stiff raw material inflation in your Paint Stores and in your Performance Coatings Groups and why your margins in the DIY segment have collapsed as much as they did?", "John Morikis", "Yes. I'd say, it's mostly just a timing issue, Dmitry. The issues that when you put a paint program in with many of our customers, we're kind of buying into that program, and we're working with our customers through the paint season. And we start having discussions with them to let them know of what's happening so that we can adjust.", "And even on the painting contractor side, we work with our painters, but their projects are typically limited in scope. And so if we're going to work with them as prices increase through a project, that project completes. And then as we move to the next project, our prices are going to reflect the new raw materials. So it's really a timing issue.", "On the performance coating side, same thing. We work with many agreements here at - on the Sherwin side. We were ahead of the ball a little bit, so we got in a little bit quicker. On the Valspar side, historically, they've been able to do it. They're a little behind, and we're executing those right now. So I'd answer it really that it comes down to just timing.", "Dmitry Silversteyn", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Best of luck for the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Mike Sison with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Sison", "Hi, guys. Just a quick one on Valspar. I know you're a little bit behind on raw materials, but what about organic growth? Has the team been able to keep up pace? I mean, industrial markets are kind of humming right now.", "John Morikis", "Yes, we are.", "Michael Sison", "We are seeing new products and their ability to match growth there?", "John Morikis", "Sorry if we're interrupting you there, Mike. Yes, we are. We are getting some nice growth on both the core or legacy Sherwin and the Valspar side. And that's - what's really nice is it's across all of our industrial businesses. So there's a nice momentum as we go into 2018. We're feeling really good about.", "When you think about what we're going through with the integration, the ability to retain the customers, growing our customer base, retaining our employees on both sides, I mean, we're feeling good about the momentum that we have here.", "Michael Sison", "Okay. And quick follow-up. I love it seems that you've kept the shelf space on both ends there. And the next line you'll be coming up in six months. But what's sort of a strategy or what do you want to show those on the six months to nine months to maintain that share longer-term?", "John Morikis", "I'm sorry you're asking us what we're going to show lows?", "Michael Sison", "Yes, what sort of that strategy and keeping that shelf space?", "Al Mistysyn", "Well, Yes, I'll answer it 50,000 feet here. It's to work with our customer to understand what it is that they want and make sure that we're providing that to help them reach our goals. I know you'll understand. We don't want to lay down our strategy here for any customer. But it all comes back to having a very good understanding and responding very well to our customers' needs and helping them reach their goals.", "Michael Sison", "Got it. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Silke Kueck with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Silke Kueck", "Hi. Good morning. How are you?", "John Morikis", "Good morning, Silke.", "Silke Kueck", "Just some small stuff. Your depreciation for next year is running something like $70 million a quarter, I think. And - but in the fourth quarter of this year, I think your depreciation was like $123 million. Was there like an asset write-down or something that was in that number? ", "John Morikis", "Yes, Silke. We had a number of moving parts in our fourth quarter. We did make a policy change, a threshold change on our capitalization. We took a hit for that in the quarter that will not repeat. And there was also some purchase accounting on the inventory depreciation step-up that we took in the quarter.", "So we believe that we've gotten \u2013 well, we believe we've gotten the bigger onetime adjustments behind us as we go into next year, into 2018. But we're still \u2013 the valuation is still open. We're still reviewing it, and we have till end of May to get that finalized. But I do believe we got most of the one-time adjustments behind us.", "Silke Kueck", "Okay. And when you look at your outlook for the consumer business, like in the first quarter and for the year, do you think the consumer business is going to grow at the low end of your sales growth guidance or at the high end or below or above those ranges? Do you have a view? ", "John Morikis", "Well, I would tell you that our expectations are always it's going to be at the high end. Again, you come out of the fourth quarter, it's a smaller quarter. First quarter, virtually the same dynamics. So...", "Silke Kueck", "But the bar is pretty \u2013 the bar is pretty low, right?", "John Morikis", "It is, it is. You\u2019re exactly \u2013 I'm going to bring it to my next management meeting. So we do have high expectations of how this business performs in the first quarter. How about if I leave it at that?", "Silke Kueck", "And secondly, I think you said your incremental synergies on an absolute basis that you expect year-over-year are like $140 million to $160 million. And that also looks conservative because if you ended the year at a run rate of $230 million, that means you're already getting, I don't know, $58 million a quarter. And like somewhere by the end of the fourth quarter, it's going to be like $80 million a quarter if you get to $320 million.", "So do you think that the incremental savings in 2018 should be bigger than $140 million or $160 million? It should be more like, I don't know, $180 million or $190 million. Why is the number so conservative? Or do you expect like very low savings in the very beginning of the year and then a lot at the back half or...?", "John Morikis", "No, Silke. I think what you're seeing is in the run rate synergy, there are projects that were tracking \u2013 and I'll use the example, a manufacturing rationalization. So in September of 2017, we announced the rationalization of four manufacturing facilities in the U.S. We won't see the benefit in the P&L of those rationalizations until very late 2018 and more likely in 2019. But that would be in my run rate synergy number.", "So I want to \u2013 we got to be careful about including the run rate synergy in our P&L. So that's why, in the call, we just tried to break out the \u2013 what we think is going to hit our P&L in 2018 versus what we think \u2013 as we continue to enter projects throughout 2018, that will go into that $320 million run rate at the end of 2018. Many of those projects won't be realized until the following year. So that's why it's \u2013 where the number is.", "Silke Kueck", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "John Morikis", "Thank you, Silke. ", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Patrick Lambert with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.", "Patrick Lambert", "Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. [Indiscernible] Two sets of questions. The first one, coming back to the synergies. Did you actually quantify the run rate in 2017? I think I had 106. But I'm not sure if you put that number out. And if you could also, and I know it's very difficult, the actual run rate exiting '17 in terms of savings, basically, Q4 savings run rate. Not the synergy but the savings actually achieved, that would be very useful to receive the progression? So that's one.", "And in terms of cost of synergies, I think you mentioned at the beginning it was about $200 million for overall. But I think if I look at full year '17, you only spent some $18 million. Is that the correct way of seeing it and we should put 220 for next year? So that's for synergy. The second set is on the tax, the cash tax rate. Maybe you want to answer the first part.", "Allen Mistysyn", "On the synergies, the $106 million was a run rate synergy that we talked about that the beginning of the closing of the acquisition. We increased that to $160 million at the end of the third quarter, on our third quarter call. And now we're seeing that we actually have a run rate synergy number of $230 million coming out of 2017.", "As far as the run rate and the P&L, what we've realized in the seven months in the P&L is about $60 million. We've talked about $50 million. The actual number is about $60 million.", "It's hard to say - to give you, hi, we think we've got $8 million or $10 million a month. That'll change as new projects come online, as systems get implemented and the timing of those get to be hard to predict. That's why I probably - I want to be caution about getting you are run rate coming out of the year knowing that there is variability in the timing going forward. But you would expect, as the year goes on, our run rate in the month would increase as the year goes on.", "The other comment you talked about cost to achieve. The $200 million in cost of achieve was really what we're trying to get accomplished through the end of 2018. So from June 1 through the end of 2018, we're trying to get us much as much of the integration and the cost of achieve behind us. In 2017, the actual impact of cost to achieve were about $127 million. And we have in our forecast or our guidance for 2018 another $100 million. So that's where you get $227 million.", "Patrick Lambert", "Okay. So let me switch to revenue tax rates and the impact of the U.S. reform. It's basically - is it fair to say that it's about four - between four and five percentage points of tax reduction? And if you could comment more on the cash taxes, how you see that? I calculate about $18 million extra free cash from that reform. Is that your assumptions, too?", "Allen Mistysyn", "We're still analyzing the impacts as we go through the interpretations on the effective tax rate. That's why we talked about the '18 guidance, we have low to mid-20s on our effective tax rate. And along with that, there is a benefit that we'll get in our cash taxes, and we're just - we're still, like I said, walking through that. But we would expect to see a benefit our cash related to the lower rates.", "Patrick Lambert", "Is that - is 80 a good start to them?", "Allen Mistysyn", "80 would be a good start.", "Patrick Lambert", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, Patrick.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "John Roberts", "Thank you. Back on consumer again, we've had this good, optimistic kind of sell-in in the start of the year for the past couple of years and then the inventory reductions by the customers at the back end of the years. Are you expecting that again simply because it's low risk for the sell-in to go well? And again, we will have a few slide at the end of the year whether or not the market was real sluggish again, and we'll pull back on the inventories at the back end?", "John Morikis", "Well, I would tell you that we are going in with high expectations and, as I mentioned, determination. But your point is a good one, John. We wanted to have better results here as we entered into 2017. I would say the differences that we continue to refine what it is that we do that can help our customers separate themselves.", "As I mentioned earlier, it's not just doing the same things, hoping for different results. And that's why I made that point. We are working with our customers with a different approach and different ways that we can help them to grow their business. So I'd be disappointed if we find ourselves in the same situation at the end of the year.", "John Roberts", "And then back on raw materials. One of your competitors specifically cited the environmentally driven production curtailment in China. Epoxies were singled out. I don't know if you're seeing particular pressure in our packaging coating business because of epoxy. And again, you have a Chinese architectural business. Now I don't know if their raw materials are being affected differently than the rest of the world.", "John Morikis", "So John, Chinese TIO2 has been up pretty sharply in 2017, and that was as a result of supply curtailments. I don't know so much about epoxies.", "Bob Wells", "There was a spike and then a drop in the pricing. But I'd say that it seems right now, I believe, to be back in line.", "John Roberts", "Okay. Thank you.", "John Morikis", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "It appears we have no further questions at this time. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Wells for any additional concluding comments.", "Bob Wells", "Thanks again, Jessie. Let me wrap up today by asking you to save the date of Tuesday, May 22, on your calendars. That's the day we'll host our Annual Financial Community Presentation at the Langham Hotel in Boston. The program will consist of a brief business review by each of our segment leadership teams, followed by a detailed update on our Valspar integration progress.", "We'll host our customary Q&A session followed by a reception and lunch. Again, that date is Tuesday, May 22. We'll be sending out invitations and related information and a link to our registration site in late March, so please watch your e-mail.", "As always, I'll be available over the next few days to handle any additional questions that arise as you digest this morning's call. If you like to be placed in the queue or for a follow-up call, you can call Kristy Johnson at 216-566-3001 and she will add you to the callback schedule.", "I'd like to thank you again for joining us today, and thanks for your continued interest in Sherwin-Williams.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.
