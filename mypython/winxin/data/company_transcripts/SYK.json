Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Brent Williams - D.A. Davidson & Co. (Investment Management)", "Operator", "Welcome to the first quarter 2017 Stryker earnings call. My name is Crystal, and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC.", "Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO, and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I'll provide opening comments, followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.", "Our Q1 sales performance underscores the strength of our businesses, with organic sales growth topping 8%. We had one extra selling day, which contributed approximately 1 percentage point of growth.", "While the sales performance was strong across the organization, MedSurg was a standout, delivering organic growth of 10.8%, as new products and sales force execution drove market share gains. The Orthopaedics and Neurotech and Spine segments were solid in the quarter, posting organic sales gains of 7.2% and 5.3% respectively.", "On a geographic basis, growth was 7.6% in the U.S., while OUS delivered gains of 9.9%. OUS growth was driven by strong performances in Europe, Canada, and Australia. Acquisitions contributed roughly 10.6% to Q1's growth, recognizing the previously discussed factors that impacted Physio's first quarter performance, while lingering recall challenges limited Sage's growth. We remain confident in the underlying strength of both Physio and Sage and expect them to be back on track for the balance of the year.", "Our particularly strong top line performance allowed us to make key strategic investments and sustain healthy R&D spending. Adjusted per-share earnings increased approximately 19%, topping the high end of our range at $1.48 per share.", "Looking ahead, our Q1 results reflect strong momentum and support of our ongoing strategy of investing in focused sales teams, internal innovation, and acquisitions. We are highly confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year targets and once again grow sales at the high end of MedTech with leveraged earnings.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today's call will focus on MAKO.", "During Q1 we installed 18 robots globally, of which 11 were in the U.S. We also continue to upgrade existing robots in the field, a process that is ramping nicely and we expect will continue through 2018.", "As many of you on the call are aware, following a highly focused limited launch, we initiated the full commercial release of the total knee at last month's AAOS [American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons] meeting. Since the launch, we have trained over 200 surgeons on the TKA [Total Knee Arthroplasty] application at roughly 90 different locations. We have 40 training locations in the U.S., with another five OUS, which is helping drive volumes of MAKO TKA procedures, which are accelerating monthly.", "We remain focused on ensuring a highly successful MAKO TKA launch, with outcomes that we believe will benefit our customers and patients. The feedback from surgeons has been very positive, and we believe this underscores the methodical approach we took as part of the limited market release in order to optimize the user experience.", "For those of you at the recent AAOS meeting, the excitement around the MAKO TKA application was apparent at our MAKO surgeon event, which was attended by 1,600 healthcare professionals, many of whom also attended the 25 MAKO TKA demonstrations conducted over the course of the academy meeting. We believe the excitement around the TKA application will be evident in our knee market shares, which while already outpacing the market, we continue to expect even greater share gains as we exit 2017.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Katherine. Today I will focus my comments on our first quarter financial results and the related performance drivers. We have provided our detailed financial results in today's press release.", "Our organic sales growth was 8.2% in the quarter. As a reminder, Q1 included one more selling day, which had the impact of adding roughly 1% in growth. Keep in mind that the selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses.", "Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1% from prior year, while foreign currency had an unfavorable 0.4% impact on sales. Both U.S. and international sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with first quarter organic growth of 7.6% and 9.9% respectively. Both geographies benefited from the extra selling day.", "In the U.S., there were strong performances across Orthopaedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology. International sales growth demonstrated solid gains in Europe, Canada, and Australia and benefited from favorable emerging market comparables.", "Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.48 increased 19.4% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions, operating expense control, and the benefit of the change in accounting guidance for tax benefits from certain stock compensation expenses now included in our tax provision. Our first quarter EPS was negatively impacted $0.04 by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.", "Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 7.8% and organic growth of 7.2%, including organic growth of 7.4% in the U.S. This performance was highlighted by positive performances in knees at 7.2% and trauma and extremities at 8.7%. The primary drivers of performance in the quarter included strong demand for our 3D printed products, our foot and ankle portfolio, and our MAKO platform. Orthopaedics international delivered organic growth of 6.8%, with solid performances in Europe, Canada, and Australia.", "MedSurg continued to have strong performances across all businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 36.6% and organic gains of 10.8%, which included a 9.6% increase in the U.S.", "Instruments had a good performance coming off a strong order book in Q4, with U.S. organic sales growth of 7.8%. This included continued momentum related to its Neptune waste management business. Additionally, instruments also shipped initial units of its newest power tool product line, System 8.", "Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic sales growth of 14.3%. This reflects strong demand for its video platform, booms and lights, and sports medicine products.", "The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 6.4%, driven by its core bed, stretcher, and power cot products. As discussed previously, Physio's results were impacted by a tough quarterly comparable that included the legacy company's fiscal year end. As such, Medical's Physio business was down 18% on a comparable basis.", "Medical Sage business grew 3%, which was below our expectations and primarily related to the ongoing recovery from last year's product recall issues. This resulted in some interruption of supply to customers. During the quarter, Sage continued to work through resupplying these customers and anticipates a full recovery by the end of the second quarter. Both Sage and Physio acquisitions anniversary in the second quarter, and we continue to anticipate that they will be accretive to our earnings as previously guided.", "Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 15.7%, which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparables in China.", "Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 7.7% and organic growth of 5.3%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products, offset by softness in our Spine business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted growth of 9.7% for the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our ischemic stroke products, CMF products, and our neuro powered instruments. Our Spine business in the U.S. continued to see the residual impact of supply issues. We expect some easing of these issues in the second quarter.", "Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 9.8%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia.", "Now I will focus on operating highlights in the first quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.5% was down 150 basis points from prior-year quarter but up 20 basis points sequentially from the fourth quarter of 2016. As compared to the prior-year first quarter, gross margin was unfavorably impacted primarily by acquisitions as well as business mix and foreign currency.", "Our adjusted SG&A was 35.8% of sales, which was 160 basis points favorable to the prior-year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from business mix, including the impact of leverage from acquisitions, and continued focus on our operating expense improvements through our Cost Transformation for Growth [CTG] program. This favorability is primarily offset by continued planned investments in our CTG program, our ERP project, and certain expenses related to launching our MAKO TKA platform. R&D, with spending at 6.5% of sales, continues to reflect our commitment to innovation.", "In total, adjusted operating expenses were 42.3% of sales, which was 150 basis points favorable to the prior-year quarter. With the strong top line momentum, we anticipate continuing to make investments related to CTG and MAKO in the second quarter as we execute these programs to drive longer-term share growth and leverage.", "In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales and essentially flat to the prior-year quarter. Our operating margin reflects good leverage offset by key investments related to driving future operational savings and product growth platforms. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our full-year commitment of driving 30 to 50 basis points improvement in our operating margin.", "Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Our other expenses increased primarily due to higher net interest expense associated with increased acquisition-related borrowings that were not outstanding in the prior-year quarter. This is partially offset by increased interest income.", "Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 15.3% reflects an underlying operating tax rate of 18%, offset by a 2.7% benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses. As a reminder, the first quarter includes the bulk of the benefit of this accounting change, and moving forward we would anticipate an effective tax rate closer to 17%.", "Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position, with $3.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 85% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.2 billion.", "Turning to cash flow, our first quarter cash from operations was approximately $151 million. During the quarter, we completed a $230 million share repurchase, which will offset the impact of dilution in 2017.", "And turning to Q2 guidance, we reaffirm our expectation of organic annual sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2017. As a reminder, Q2 and Q3 will have one less selling day as compared to 2016, and Q4 has the same number of selling days.", "Finally, for 2017, we reaffirm that our adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $6.35 to $6.45 for the full year. For the second quarter, we anticipate adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.48 to $1.52, which includes the aforementioned investment, foreign currency impacts, and the impact of the accounting change for stock compensation.", "I will now open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.", "Good afternoon. Maybe, Kevin, one for you and then maybe one on MAKO. So, Kevin, just thinking about the strength in the first quarter, obviously even adjusted for the selling day, your organic growth is in excess of the top end of your guidance range for the year. So can you just talk about how you see the pacing for the balance of the year? Are there any factors you could point to that would drive deceleration based on the very strong start to the beginning of the year? And then I had a quick follow-up.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Sure. Thanks, David. After Q1, we are obviously very happy with how our businesses have performed and the momentum in the business that we have. Keep in mind, as Glenn mentioned, we have one less selling day in each of the next two quarters, and we did start out the year with higher top line targets and a tighter EPS range than we did in the prior year. So at this point we feel great about the guidance we have out there. Let's see where we are at the midpoint before we think about adjusting our ranges, but I would tell you there's nothing out there that I'm worried about. The business momentum is very strong across our portfolio.", "David R. Lewis - Aurelian Resources, Inc.", "Okay. Kevin or others, just thinking about MAKO post-AAOS, our sense is that went at or better than your expectations. So how would you characterize post the meeting training, backlog of systems, or receptivity? And are you still as confident as you were before that we start to see some share movement towards the latter half of this year? Thanks so much.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, David. I would say absolutely the AAOS launch really probably exceeded our expectations, 1,600 healthcare professionals at our MAKO event, but more importantly, I think the interest around the demonstrations and follow-up from surgeons who wanted to get better educated and understand.", "I'm really pleased with the robots that we installed in the quarter with that same sales force out upgrading systems in the field for the total knee application. So we feel really good about the rollout, the pace we're on. We've tried to be very methodical in approaching the full commercial launch. But with 40 training sites and over 200 surgeons trained and the volumes building monthly, we feel really good about the launch and the rollout for the year.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "David, I'd just add. Our Orthopaedics team did a spectacular job at the AAOS meeting. And I even had tremendous feedback from surgeons from outside of the United States, from Asia, from Europe. And so I think you're going to see MAKO pick up around the world. Obviously, the U.S. is going to be the biggest market. But as you saw even in the first quarter, we sold quite a lot of robots outside the United States. So the meeting was a huge success. We feel very bullish about the TK application with MAKO.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question will come from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks and good afternoon, guys. Let me start with just one MAKO question because I know you're not going to disclose the number of system upgrades that you're going to do on a quarterly basis with the percentage of your installed base that is upgraded. That's probably the metric that is most interesting to us. So can you give us some insight into where you think you are relative to your plan at this point or your expectations going into the year on the percentage that you have upgraded at this point?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Mike. We feel really good about where we are. We're pacing. We started doing the upgrades in the fourth quarter. They're continuing to accelerate sequentially. We think the process, the vast majority of those robots in the field are going to get upgraded, and that's a process we think will take us through next year. Part of the challenge is, honestly, bandwidth because we have the same capital sales force that we're trying to expand. But they're doing the upgrades; they're doing the new installs. So, it's managing the demand out there. But we feel great about the momentum we're seeing, the level of interest, and we would expect those upgrades to continue to build.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then the commentary on different parts of the MedSurg business, I was hoping you could just spend another minute on, A), on the plus side, I was struck by how strong the Endo business was this quarter. Both U.S. and internationally, it was exceptionally strong. And I think we have a good understanding of why that is. And then B), I think the comps for Physio were harder I think than the Street necessarily appreciated, so that was a bit more challenging. Could you just level-set expectations on Physio after this quarter?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So you're correct on Endo. We're in year two of the 1588 AIM launch. And as you've heard us talk about before and you know well, those tend to be multiyear launch and Q2 is typically a very strong year, but they're also seeing very good momentum with booms and lights and the sports medicine business, which continues to see really nice growth; smaller base, but really pleased with the performance there.", "Physio, yes, we had talked previously about the difficult comps given really robust first quarter the year ago, compounded by the fact that it wasn't part of us and that was their prior fiscal year end. And as you know, capital businesses tend to be the strongest in the fiscal year end, so we did expect this quarter to reflect those trends. We feel really good about the momentum in that business as well as Sage, which we also expect to be back to a normalized run rate in Q2. So it's really limited to a Q1 event that was much more to do around the comparisons as opposed to anything underlying in the business.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, we can.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, good afternoon and congrats on such a strong start to the year. I just wanted to continue that line of questioning on Sage and Physio. So do you guys still expect at this point the same kind of EPS accretion that you talked about previously and for these deals to also be accretive to growth?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Yes. Bob, as we look at the forecast for both of those businesses, first of all, as Katherine explained, we did anticipate that Physio would be down just given the comparable in the prior year. Sage maybe is ramping a little bit slower than we had thought just because of the product recall and getting that product back to customers. But for the full year, we're still committed to the guidance we provided of the $0.15 to $0.18 per share, and the growth will be accretive for the full year when we get to the end.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then for my second question, just to stick with MAKO and expectations setting, given that you're providing a net number, how should we think about that over the course of the rest of the year? Should we think about it in terms of steady year-over-year improvement as far as the net number because obviously that's a number that's going to get a lot of scrutiny. I think you placed 86 last year. Is it reasonable to expect a pretty nice uptick this year from a net perspective? I was wondering if you could just set expectations for that net placement number that you gave us.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So I think we haven't guided to a robot number. I think you should assume while the net number will grow year over year, it won't be at the same pace that you've seen from a growth rate perspective as the base has gotten a lot bigger.", "And also keep in mind that that's only part of the story now. So while we'll continue to report like this quarter the 18 robots installed, just as importantly is that sales force out there doing the upgrades of the fleet, which as you know easily exceeds 300. So the combined force of that, which is all recorded in that other recon revenue line, but it really is both of those. So yes, there will be year-over-year growth in robots installed, but on top of that and really driving a lot of the power of the ability to take market share gains is the number of installations and upgrades that we're doing.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "And just to add, Bob, I think we're really encouraged by the knee growth rate. As you recall, last year we had a very strong first quarter in our knee business, and on top of that we grew very well again this quarter. So our knee business has had multiple quarters in a row of growing higher than the market, and we expect that to continue.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good afternoon, everybody. I want to return to the knee growth as well. You said, obviously, knee growth, knee share already outpacing the market, and you expect more. I'm just trying \u2013 just looking at it, worldwide numbers, first quarter up 7.2% against an easy comp, but very much in line with fourth quarter growth. When we think about \u2013 is 7%-plus, is that the kind of growth we should be thinking about the franchise as we look at it for the rest of the year even though you have a tougher comp in the second quarter, given some of the momentum you're talking about, Kevin?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So I'm not sure the comp reference that you're making, Rick, because if you look at last year's first quarter, our knee business in the U.S. was 9% growth.", "Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, I'm sorry. I must be looking at the wrong number.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "If you look at 7.4%, we grew that off of a 9% in the prior year.", "Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So we're feeling great about the knee business. It's gaining momentum. And really, once the total knee \u2013 really that application and those upgrades take hold and the surgeons have a good experience, that's locked-in market share gains. The more surgeons do it and the more that they enjoy that procedure and see the benefits of that procedure, that becomes a locked-in market share. So we expect the momentum to continue, and we had a really outstanding first quarter if you consider that comparison.", "Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Exactly. And you talked about making more MAKO investments. Maybe help us understand what that's going to encompass, specifically I think you said in the second quarter. Obviously, you understand the continuing investment in sales force and upgrades and training. But is there anything over and above that that we should be thinking about?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "No. As Glenn referenced, given the strong start to the year, momentum we're seeing, there was an opportunity to make some strategic investments in a few areas, CTG, ERP, that had been anticipated, as well as MAKO as we've been really pleased with the rollout. But there are obviously always opportunities where if there's investment dollars available that can help drive longer-term growth, we want to take advantage of those. So nothing I'd call out in specifics other than really supporting the overall MAKO TKA launch.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "And just accelerating some of our spending plans. So we obviously have a commitment to margin expansion, operating margin expansion for the full year. We're still committed to that. But we have the chance to accelerate some of that spending to really get behind the launch. And so far, we're extremely pleased with the way the launch is going.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Rick, keep in mind that as we described our CTG plan and we describe our operating margin improvement targets, we said at the analyst meeting last year that it would be 30 to 50 basis points, but in the earlier year it would be closer to 30 because of these types of investments that need to be made.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Your line is open.", "Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi, thanks for taking our question. So I wanted to talk a little bit about Spine, maybe some of the efforts that you're putting in place there in terms of your product line, in terms of the sales force, or just what has been effective that you found in terms of improving the growth rate of that business. How sustainable is that? And then I also \u2013 apologies, I have to ask a question here about MAKO, but I'll start with Spine. Thanks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Okay, sure. So really the biggest part of our growth story in Spine has been our Tritanium, so our 3D-printed interbody device, which is really \u2013 there was a limited launch last year, and that's really accelerating. So we're pleased with that. But we have a number of new products that are going to be 3D-printed that will be launched over the course of this year. We expect that to accelerate our growth.", "We also are bringing a couple of products back on the market that were off the market for the first \u2013 almost the whole year last year. And so those are just starting to take hold. So we actually expect our Spine business to improve over the course of the year, this quarter being a little bit softer than what we will experience in the next few quarters.", "Matthew Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "That's great. And then on Spine \u2013 I mean on MAKO, so I guess one of the things I'd love to understand, we all have heard your comment about back-end, back of the year maybe visible share gains in knees in the U.S., driven by the launch. But can you talk a little bit about maybe some of the dynamics of share or performance of these accounts as you upgrade them versus, as you say, place a new system with the total knee in place? What are those accounts like? Maybe help us understand the dynamics of how those two develop as examples. That would be very helpful.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks. Each account has its own story. It's like all politics are local discussions. So certain accounts have surgeons that will quickly adopt and convert most of their procedures to robotic, and other surgeons that will maybe be doing their robotic surgeries on a Friday, and if they're a high-volume surgeon, they may be doing their other normal procedures on a Monday or Wednesday.", "So it really varies greatly, and it's very early in the launch. So we're really not at a point yet where we could characterize them for you to say a competitive robot takes X amount of time to get to max penetration. We're gathering all of that data. And in future quarters, we'd be able to characterize that more clearly. Today it's really each account has its own story in terms of how it's scaling. But what I can tell you is we're extremely pleased. Where we're placing robots, they're becoming productive, and we're obviously tracking all of those metrics, but it's a little early yet to give you more insight.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for taking the question, so I had two questions really. One, I just wanted to see if you could give any kind of color on why pricing was a little bit better this quarter. If you could give any color on the different segments or if you saw any meaningful change, I would just love to hear about that.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Sure, Matt. Price for the quarter I will say was not as bad as we initially anticipated. But as we think about trends for the year, price is heavily impacted by mix and geography. And so just given that we only have this one quarter and that we did have a mix that was skewed a little more towards MedSurg, which provided some slight favorability, at this time I'm not willing to declare that this is a trend for the whole year. And I think that's where \u2013 so we won't revise our pricing guidance.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And then underlying some of the issues that you called out with Physio and Sage, the MedSurg business had a pretty solid quarter. And you did call out in your comments core growth in the beds and cots. I was just curious what you're seeing in the capital environment as it relates to those lines and some of the other instruments that you sell. It seems like things are pretty healthy. Is that a fair characterization?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I think we viewed our capital business, and I would stress our capital business because we have a different mix than others, as remaining healthy. There has been no real change, but the environment has been healthy for some time. We're in a strong product cycle, as you see in Endo with the 1588 AIM and now with the early \u2013 the launch of the System 8 within instruments, and these are upgrade cycles. That's something our sales force knows really well how to do in that replacement cycle. So overall, we feel good about the capital environment. I haven't noticed any real changes in those trends versus prior quarters.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "I'm really pleased with the Medical team. The core Medical business grew double digit organically on a global basis. And I think Glenn gave you the U.S. business, but internationally grew extremely well, as well. And they're doing this while integrating Sage and Physio and working through some challenges, as we discussed in those businesses. So we're really delighted with the core performance in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good afternoon, two questions. The first one has to do with emerging markets. Could you please give us an update on how you're doing in those areas?", "And then the second one, your trauma and extremity business had a wonderful quarter. Anything behind that that you can share with us? Thank you.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Sure, I'll start with emerging markets. Look, we're really pleased with the performance in India and Brazil. And our China business had good growth, which really benefited more from weaker comps in the prior quarter. But we still have more work to do there, including we're in the process of adding a new Chinese leader. And then once we start to make some changes in China, we expect that China will be a bigger contributor to our growth.", "But overall, the emerging markets were no longer a headwind, but certainly growing roughly close to the overall average for the company in the first quarter. But we're very pleased with India, very pleased with Brazil. Some of those key markets have been growing very well for us. And certainly, Brazil is a turnaround. India has been a great story for the past four years and now becoming a more meaningful business. So overall, good news, we still have a lot of work to do in China to get that business to where it needs to be.", "And your second question was on Trauma. We really have terrific performance in our foot and ankle business, driving very high growth, very strong double-digit growth, and that was the biggest contributor. But overall, we had a very strong performance. And Trauma, as you know, has been a great business for us for the past four years, and really pleased in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company LLC", "Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I just wanted to ask on the comments you made, Kevin, about the international demand for MAKO. I don't know if you guys have disclosed this historically. But can you give us some idea about where you have approvals, and then what the update is in terms of the total knee indication approval in different territories?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So outside the U.S., and I would underscore the U.S. has been obviously the main market, Australia has been a very healthy market for robot placement, and they have the TKA approval. We have approval for that application in Europe, but it's still very early. So I wouldn't assume a big contribution there. I think you really should think about the U.S. and Australia driving most of the momentum as it relates to this year.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "But we do have a smattering of MAKOs across Southeast Asia, across different European countries. They don't all yet have the TKA, and we're going to be very measured about the total knee launch. As we implement those, we're going to be as disciplined as we are here in the United States. But tremendous interest, and for us it's just pacing \u2013 making sure we put them in the right sites with the right surgeon champions and go through our training.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company LLC", "Great. And I just wanted to follow up, another MAKO question. And not to put the cart before the horse, but when you talk about incremental MAKO investments, it just rang a bell that I just had a curiosity about updates, about potential future indications. And if you're not comfortable disclosing where MAKO could potentially go, any idea in terms of when you might give the investment community an update in terms of your path forward there and indications outside of total knee and hip? Thanks for taking the questions.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I think just given the enormity of the total knee market application and the early stages of the launch, you should view our comments around accelerated some of the investment spending, it's all focused around the total knee. That's where the organization has their efforts focused. Longer term, we'll see what happens, but right now we really have everybody's energies focused around optimizing this launch given the size of the market opportunity and our desire to do it right.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Keeler from SunTrust. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just first one on MAKO, the other Ortho line was very strong, I guess highlighted \u2013 reflecting the robot placements. Was there anything in that line that was one-time or maybe related to a bolus of training or something like that that maybe mix is not sustainable, or do you think you can continue at that level of growth?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "No, there wasn't anything one-time associated in that number. But keep in mind, it includes bone cement. It includes revenue associated with the robots installed, and it includes the revenue associated with the upgrades as well as some revenue associated with SPS. So, there's a number of items in there, but there was nothing unusual other than the fact that we're installing more robots and doing upgrades.", "Unknown Speaker", "Got it, thanks. And just to drill down on an earlier question on MedSurg pricing where that turned positive in the quarter, what specifically were some of the factors that drove that? And what gives you pause around whether or not that might be sustainable?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "I think when you look at MedSurg, there's a lot of different capital products. They serve a wide customer base. And I would tell you that as you look at these deals, they're negotiated over long periods of time for larger capital. And so I can't say that any one thing pointed to an uptick in price other than the combination of we felt some really good robustness at year end, and that carried over into Q1. And I don't anticipate that we'll consistently be able to deliver a 1% price increase like we did in this quarter for MedSurg.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "But it has been \u2013 certainly that's the one segment that is the least price-sensitive within our portfolio and has been for some time. That MedSurg leadership team has really done a great job of focusing on price, even in terms of how the course is paid. They're paid more if the prices are higher for certain product categories. And so, it's not a new fact that MedSurg can drive price. It was a little bit more positive than we anticipated in the first quarter, but as the mix was very strong in that segment, and that's a segment that has been doing a very good job managing price over the past couple years.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hi, good afternoon. This is J.P. in for Matt. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the System 8 launch. I'm just trying to figure out when that officially launched and maybe some early feedback that you've seen there, and how we should think about how that can contribute to the rest of 2017 and 2018.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So, we just launched in the second quarter here, so that will ramp up as we get into the second half of the year. And as you've seen before, when we launched, whether it's a new power tool or a new camera within Endo, it typically is a multiyear run as we upgrade and hospitals go through their process of upgrading their fleet. So we feel really excited about this. This is right in the wheelhouse of what the instrument team does really well since power tools really drive that business.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "What I'm really pleased about is as System 7 starts to taper, we didn't really see the drop in growth as we had seen in the past. With previous launches, they were able to really make a nice transition from System 7 toward System 8. And I think part of that is the Neptune 3 launch has really helped on the waste management side to offset some of the slowdown, which naturally occurs when you're at the end of a product cycle. So, the instruments team has done a really nice job of holding it together as they prepared for System 8. And it's early days yet. So far the feedback has been very positive, but we'll hear a lot more about that in the next few quarters.", "J. P. McKim - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it, and then one more for me, higher level. You guys have made some good investments in 3D printing. There's a lot of buzz around 3D printing implants. It sounds like it's going pretty well in your Spine segment. I'm just wondering strategically where you think you can take this capability across your entire portfolio going forward.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Right now we're in the process. We built an entire building, and we're filling it with 3D printing machines in Cork, Ireland. We have tremendous demand and interest from basically all of our implant businesses for 3D printed products. And we're really focused on innovation. So at this point, all the products that we're launching are really adding innovation, either removing bone cement, creating new geometries that don't exist previously. So we have a pretty healthy pipeline of demands, and we're scaling it as fast as we possibly can to meet the demand.", "So I'm not going to get into specifics on which products, but we have very healthy demand, and we're extremely -- we gained tremendous experience in 3D printing titanium. So really Titanium is the key metal that we're focused on, but tremendous interest from multiple divisions of Stryker.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Petrone from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Anthony Petrone - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks and good afternoon, maybe a question just on volumes and the state of the hospital market in the U.S. broadly. And so volumes look to pick up sequentially a bit across all of the divisions, but you had the extra selling day. And really I guess the comments this quarter were mixed, mix from HCA, better from Intuitive, better from J&J, mix from some others. So maybe from where Stryker sits, what are your latest comments on volumes and hospital in general?", "And then in MAKO specifically, can you give us an idea of the foot traffic at the 40 training locations from physicians? And are you expecting a conversion rate of one-to-one from those physicians to full total knee implanters? Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So no real difference in our commentary as it relates to our mix of businesses and hospital volumes. Everything feels and looks very stable, and you can see that with the organic number that we delivered, even adjusting for the extra selling day. Our capital businesses really don't have any impact, whether it's an extra selling day or one less selling day. It really doesn't impact those businesses.", "And then in terms of the conversion, if I'm understanding the question correctly, do you mean in terms of if there's a robot out there, are they converting to TKA for an upgrade? The vast majority of the robots installed in the field we believe will be upgraded to a total knee.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "I think \u2013 but if your question was more related to people who are going to one of our training sites, if they have enough of an interest to go to a cadaver training or to go to our training sites, we do believe it's going to be a very high hit rate, because to get to that point, they will already have a certain level of interest.", "And basically, what we should, what we felt at the academy, once they start to understand what MAKO really gives them, we believe the conversion rate is going to be very high because a lot of people had a preconceived idea that they're really just getting some kind of automatic saw. And yes, the saw blade is one of the features of the robot, but it's clearly not the most impactful part of it. It's really about how you can balance the knee and make intra-operative adjustments and be able to do recuts. And there's all these other features that surgeons really didn't understand. So even those that have been surveyed in the past were expressing their feedback based on some idea of what MAKO was. And what was great about the academy meeting was they were able to really understand the full value of what of it delivers.", "So if that question around conversion rate, we do expect if they're going to go to one of these training sites for a visitation or go to a cadaver lab, we expect a very high conversion rate.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Your line is open.", "Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC", "Hi, thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to just first ask about MAKO. And at AAOS, we heard about some competitive offerings. Smith & Nephew launched their total knee. You had Zimmer who announced ambitions to get into robotics. I'm just wondering if since AAOS, if you could characterize any \u2013 how the conversations have changed with any prospective customers or anyone that's considering a robot in light of some of these other solutions, and if you could comment at all on the competitive landscape in total joint robotics.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Rich. I appreciate the question. I would say the conversation hasn't changed at all. We remain focused on launching our total knee. We believe the features and benefits of our robot and where we are in both the installed base in the field and actively doing upgrades for an existing application where we've been able to demonstrate the benefits and features of it is a pretty powerful conversation. We've talked about over 40% of the robots installed going to competitive accounts, and that continues to be the trend.", "So there's been no change in the conversation. Really, it's focused around what MAKO can do as opposed to background noise about competitive offerings that may or may not come to market.", "Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay, great. And then just to follow up here on trauma, some of the smaller spine competitors are starting to get into or have ambitions to get into trauma. I was just wondering, what can you comment on within that industry? Your growth has been holding pretty steady. It feels like it's a pretty attractive overall market. But are there any trends there that you think could lead to increased competition? And if you were to see more players coming in, why or how is Stryker potentially positioned to fend that off? Thanks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "I think trauma is a little bit different than if you look at, say, Spine. And the reason I think it's different is you really need to have a full offering. You need to have a full offering of plates. You need to have a full offering of nails. You need to have a complete offering if you want to take over an entire account or even to really thrive in a Level 1 trauma center. That was our learning. If you remember, for a long time Synthes was the dominant player in trauma. Everybody else was a distant second. And until we rounded out our full portfolio, that's really \u2013 once we finished rounding out the portfolio, that's when we really started to take off in our growth about four years ago.", "So will some competitors be able to nibble around a little bit here and there with some business? Sure, but to be a real meaningful player, having that full portfolio is extremely important. I think that makes trauma a little bit different than some of the other specialties.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Craig William Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi, guys. It's actually Craig on for Larry. Kevin, I wanted to start with you. And we've seen a number of large deals in MedTech over the last couple of years. So I just wanted to get your thoughts on potential consolidation within the space, and if there are any competitive dynamics or the environment that may be driving more of a consolidation of some of the subsectors under a bigger company.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So what I'd say is that we remain committed to our current strategy, which is to drive category leadership in the segments that we are currently playing in. And we're going to continue to do this through a combination of internal innovation as well as acquisitions. As you've seen, this strategy is serving us really well, and we expect it will continue to serve us well going into the future.", "Craig William Bijou - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. And just as a follow-up. I wanted to ask about when will the results of the DAWN clinical trial be presented? Will it be at the European Stroke Meeting in May, which I think is the next big meeting? And what impact do you think the results could have on growth of the ischemic market?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, it will be at the May meeting in Europe where we'll see the results will be presented. I think it certainly affirms the opportunity here by widening the treatment window, which is obviously one of the challenges with this ischemic patient population. But there's still work to be done in terms of building the market awareness, the referral channel, all the points along the treatment paradigm that will take a number of years to really fully realize. So it's great when we've got the clinical data to support it, but there's a lot of market development work. That's not new. We've talked about this before, but obviously this type of clinical data helps to drive that process.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kaila Krum from William Blair. Your line is open.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. When you think about the spinal implant market, and you're obviously focusing on Tritanium and 3D printing there. But can you talk a little bit more about what inning we're in with those technologies and what's next as far as your R&D pipeline in Spine? I guess specifically, do you see more value in investing in robotics technologies in Spine, or are you drawn more towards innovating the implant, either through development or acquisition of a motion preservation disk or expanding the Tritanium platform? I was just trying to understand the long-term vision there.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Sure. So for Stryker, I would tell you that we're in the early stages with Tritanium, very early stages. And we believe that it's going to have broader application. We've had terrific success. We have a claim that it promotes bone-in growth, which is a really powerful claim with Tritanium. So I would say its early innings. And certainly we only had one product that did very, very well last year. We're launching more products this year. So I think we're in the early innings of Tritanium.", "With respect to the rest of our portfolio, I'm not going to get into specifically which products that we have in development. We do have an active R&D pipeline. And clearly, the areas of less invasive surgery, biologics, those are the areas that clearly have the most potential. But I'm not going to get into specifics about which specific areas we're going to focus on, at least not at this point.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay, that's fair. And then I guess just as a follow-up, some of your Spine competitors have commented that volumes were a bit slower in Spine in January and February of this year, and then they saw a pickup in March. It doesn't sound like that's something that you're seeing broadly in your business, but is that something that you've seen in the Spine segment specifically?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "We really have stayed away from commenting on month-to-month trends. We haven't found it to be really a good barometer of how a quarter or quarters play out. So we're probably not going to get to that level of detail.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Brent Williams from D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.", "Brent Williams - D.A. Davidson & Co. (Investment Management)", "Thanks for your time. I just had a question on the CapEx spend through the year. I see a little bit of a pickup this year versus Q1 last year. I believe it was in the guidance that 2017 is going to be at $450 million. Is that still what you guys are looking at for this year?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Brent, we're still targeting that number. CapEx includes spending related to ERP and other systems as well as facilities. And as Kevin mentioned, we are spending a fair amount on new 3D printing equipment. So those are the broad categories in there, but we're still targeting the number that we guided to.", "Brent Williams - D.A. Davidson & Co. (Investment Management)", "Great, thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2017 results will be held on July 27. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's second quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations.", "Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on our M&A activity and preview our upcoming Analyst Meeting. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to Q&A.", "We continue to see solid topline momentum with organic sales growth up 5% in the quarter. After adjusting for one less selling day. this translates to underlying organic growth of over 6%. All three of our business segments, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and spine contributed to our Q2 performance.", "Starting with U.S. Reconstructive. Trauma and extremities continue to achieve market leading growth, up 13%, despite challenging comparatives from last year. This was powered by foot and ankle, which once again achieved outstanding growth, increasing over 30%. Both hips and knees registered solid performance and accelerated from Q1, with 6% and 7% growth, respectively. Note that the impact of one less selling day is most pronounced in our hip and knee business, which would have added roughly 150 basis points of growth. These businesses also benefit from improving trend in MAKO which we expect to continue in the back half of the year. Katherine will operate on this shortly.", "Turning to U.S. MedSurg. We had strong performances in instruments, endoscopy and medical. Instruments increased 7%, driven by continued uptake of the Neptune Waste Management System. Endoscopy growth of 17% was aided by recent acquisitions but even after adjusting for these, still grew at an impressive 9%. Medical remained steady with a 3% increase. Sustainability solutions had negative growth in the quarter, but has recently received five 10-K approvals that will return it to positive growth starting in Q3.", "The U.S. Neurotechnology had another strong showing of 8% growth with neurovascular NSE and CMF all performing well. U.S. spine results were soft this quarter, down 6%, reflecting pricing pressure and some sales force disruptions. We believe that a number of measures, including strengthening the leadership team and bolstering our product pipeline along with our recent acquisition of CoAlign should get this business back to its normal rhythm by year-end.", "International constant currency growth of 5% reflects sustained improvement in Europe, as well as excellent performance in China, Australia, South America and India. These strong performances were partially offset by weak results in Japan as we continue to work through a challenging ERP implementation as well as the biannual price cuts. Most product categories had good performance although hips and knees were negative, owing to the Japan issues and from tougher comparisons, particularly in Europe, as we anniversary our turnaround. The small market issues in Asia, which we have alluded to on past calls are largely behind us and should no longer be a drag in the back half of the year.", "Turning to the P&L. Gross margin declined year-over-year owing to a modestly tougher pricing environment, product mix and negative foreign exchange. R&D increased in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales, reflecting our commitment to internally driven innovation, coupled with the impact from our acquisitions. Our focus on delivering greater SG&A efficiencies helped drive the year-over-year improvement in operating expenses. Combined with a lower tax rate we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.08.", "For the full year, we are narrowing our guidance on sales and EPS. We expect full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 5% to 6% and adjusted EPS in the range of $4.75 to $4.80. These changes reflect first half performance, our expectation of accelerating sales growth and the impact of acquisitions on EPS.", "Looking ahead to 2015, we will provide specific guidance at the end of January as we do each year, however, given the recent opening of our European regional headquarters we wanted to alert you to additional benefits that will accrue in 2015 versus 2014. We expect our 2015 effective tax rate to improve by roughly two percentage points or $0.10 to $0.15 per share. Of this benefit, we plan to reinvest about half to accelerate our topline growth and drop the other half to the bottomline. Therefore, we would expect an additional $0.05 to $0.80 per share improvement beyond our normal target for 2015. Bill will share more about the European regional headquarters later in the call and we will discuss the reinvestment plans later this year.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be an overview of the recently announced planned acquisition of SBi, an update on the performance and expectations for our major recent acquisitions and a preview of our upcoming Analyst Meeting.", "Starting first with SBi. We announced the planned acquisition of this key player in the small bone extremity market in late June for a net consideration of approximately $285 million. Through SBi's focus on the total ankle as well as the upper extremity small joint replacement segment, we are meaningfully supplementing our small bone fixation portfolio with a comprehensive product offering.", "Importantly, there is minimal overlap with our existing products and we are well positioned to leverage our considerable sales and marketing infrastructure to access the various surgical specialists that focused on extending procedures. SBi's STAR Total Ankle Replacement, which represents roughly 50% of sales is the only PMA approved, cementless mobile bearing total ankle in the U.S. With these products we will expand our customer base with fellowship trained foot and ankle surgeons.", "Additionally, roughly half of SBi surgeons are not currently customers of Stryker's T&E products. While we do anticipate some level dis-synergies in 2014 at we integrate the company, we expect to return to solid topline growth with a five year anticipated CAGR beginning in 2015 of over 20%, and with the recent success of our specialized foot and ankle sales force as well as the strength of our traditional branch agent sales channel, the timing is optimal for our organization to leverage this acquisition.", "Moreover, the addition of upper extremity small joints will allow the opportunity to focus on this important sub-segment, a market estimated at over 200 million globally. In sum with the recent launch of our internally developed reverse shoulder, our expanded offering in small joint is answering a key gap in foot and ankle with at the STAR Ankle, we fully anticipate building on our clear success in the extremities market.", "We closed the Berchtold acquisition on April 15, which is in the communications business unit of our endoscopy division. For this year, our commercial integration is focused on customer lead sharing with Stryker Communication sales team shared operating room table leads with their Stryker Berchtold counterpart and in turn for Berchtold to share operating room integration system leads. To date, the partnership between the sales forces have generated over 100 new leads. We anticipate maintaining separate sales representation between the existing Berchtold and Stryker portfolios through year-end at which point they will move into a single sales team.", "We have been pleased with the initial results of the Pivot acquisition, which closed on March 7 and is reported within the sports medicine business unit of our endoscopy division. Stryker successfully completed the transition of the product sales to our direct sales force during the first 90 days of operation while maintaining very strong double-digit growth. Since close, we delivered the requisite product and procedural training to all reps and sampling to those reps that covered the existing 350 plus Pivot customers. We will sample the balance of the sales force by the end of Q3.", "Turning to the acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies which provided us with the SurgiCount Safety-Sponge System and is now part of the instruments division. This deal was closed on March 24, and we have begun sampling the system and training our sales reps. Since the close we have added roughly 100 new customer contracts mainly through further expansion in our existing customer base, as well as in new accounts. Installations are ongoing that will increase the install base of customers to over 400 by the end of the year.", "With respect to Trauson, which provided us with a leading brand in the fast-growing lower-priced segment of the Chinese market, we are now well into our second year and are pleased with the performance and success of the integration in China. With dedicated leadership for both the premium and lower-priced segment, we believe we are optimizing the market opportunity, while remaining focused on the specific attributes of these two distinct markets for Q2 growth in emerging markets with strong double-digits led by China, Brazil and India, and partly offset by ongoing market conditions in Russia.", "Turning to MAKO. We closed in late 2013 and worked through much of the first quarter on the integration plan, which we rolled out to our sales force at the start of April. During Q2 we were focused on training our existing reps on the technology and its benefit. We have now trained roughly 20% of our 1,000 reps in the U.S. and are expanding the MAKO training capabilities to cover the remainder of our selling organization by year-end. While the integration proved to be more challenging than anticipated, we believe we are gaining momentum as robust sales in Q2 improved with six points in the quarter. Importantly, our order book has strengthened and we anticipate continued sequential acceleration and robust placement. We are also encouraged by system utilization which improved during Q2. We remain on track to launch a total knee system in 2015 and also plan to launch our key hip systems on MAKO next year.", "Finally, we would be hosting our Analyst Meeting September 17 at our orthopedic headquarters in New Jersey starting at 10:30. We are restructuring the meeting's agenda to provide greater visibility into certain businesses or key opportunities for the company. Specifically, the meeting will include a surgeon panel focused on the MAKO opportunity, which will be moderated by David Floyd, Group President of Orthopedics. Tim Scannell, Group President of MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine will focus his comments on our instruments division, including the relaunch of Neptune and our recent acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies.", "For the international perspective, Ramesh Subrahmanian will highlight our expanding presence in China. Lonny Carpenter Group President, GQO will detail the benefits of our European regional headquarters, which went live on July 1. With this focused presence in Amsterdam, we are excited about the opportunity which include continued strengthening our European presence and organization, the ability to co-locate leaders in a central location to increase collaboration, drive greater efficiency and to simplify and improve the customer experience.", "And as Kevin mentioned and Bill will cover in more detail, we also expect meaningful savings as a result of our RHQ. Following the formal portion of the Analyst Meeting, we will once again have a product fair at the Homer Stryker Center. This year, the focus will be on orthopedics, including reconstructive, MAKO, sports medicine implants, trauma and extremities. In addition to the opportunities in many of our products, including recent launches and acquisition, the broader orthopedic leadership team will be in attendance and look forward to your question. We hope you will be able to join us.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was positive by 6.8% in the second quarter including a negative impact, slight impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was a positive 6.9% which includes organic growth of 4.8%. We had a negative impact from one less selling day in the quarter and on a days adjusted basis, core growth exceeded 6%.", "EPS on a GAAP basis for the second quarter were $0.56 per share, flat with last year, while adjusted EPS were $1.08 per share for the quarter versus $1.07 per share last year. This quarter's EPS includes a negative impact of approximately $0.02 per share from FX and if foreign exchange rate stay at current level, the back half of the year should see only a slight negative impact per quarter.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustment in the quarter are related to $160 million increase in the charges associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate & ABG II. These charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined, and again no insurance proceeds that may potentially be available to cover some of these costs have been included.", "Looking at sales in the second quarter, our organic growth of 4.8% was comprised of a positive 6.8% from volume and mix with price negatively impacting sales by approximately 2%. Acquisitions added 2.1%, while FX had no material impact on sales in the quarter.", "Looking at our segments, reconstructive represented 44% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of reconstructive products were up 6.5% as reported and grew 6.3% constant currency, and increased 3.6% organically. U.S. reconstructive sales grew 10.7% in the quarter. Trauma and extremities once again had another solid quarter and sales in the U.S. were increased by 13.2% and grew 9.2% internationally, with robust growth in our foot and ankle business as we continue to have great success in an expanding market.", "U.S. hips and knees growth in the period of 6.3% and 7.1% were partially offset by declines in international markets of 2.7% and 5.6%. In the prior year quarter, our international growth was 5.9% in knees and 10.4% in hips, which were challenging comps.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 38% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 8.8% as reported and 9% on a constant currency basis and increased 6.7% organically. These results benefited from high single digit growth from our instruments business and a high double-digit growth in endoscopy which included incremental revenue from recent acquisitions.", "Note that endo has a much tougher comp in the third quarter, however, instruments will have a much easier comp in the period as Neptune had a greater negative impact in the back half of last year. Medical had low single-digit growth again in the period against some strong prior year performance. Our instruments division has the Neptune product back on the market and should see additional improvements in the back half of the year, compared to last year. International sales were strong, up 13.2% in constant currency benefiting nicely from both organic and acquisition growth.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and spine which represents 18% of our sales increased 3.8% as reported, 3.9% on a constant currency basis and 3.7% organically. Growth in this segment was led by our neurotechnology businesses and IVS which grew strong single and low double-digit in constant currency, respectively, while spinal implant sales were down low single digits.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2014 were 66.2% compared to 67.7% in the same period last year. Foreign exchange rates continued to pressure margins and prices declined approximately 2% in the quarter, while product mix also was a factor in the year-over-year decline. As mentioned, the negative FX impact should continue to lessen in the back half of the year.", "Research and development expenses increased to 6.7% of sales versus 6% of sales last year in the quarter. This is a 19.7% increase in R&D spending over last year, reflecting a higher level of R&D spending tied to recent acquisitions and our commitment to invest more actively in few key areas which we believe will help us deliver above market sales growth, including our Neurotecsh businesses.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 43.9% of sales in the second quarter. This included approximately $166 million of cost related to the Rejuvenate and recall matters. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $841 million or 35.6% of sales in the second quarter of 2014 versus 36.7% in the prior year's second quarter as we continue to focus on driving greater operational efficiencies.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.9% in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 24.9% in the second quarter of 2013. The rate was negatively impacted primarily by pricing and foreign exchange rates in the quarter, along with higher R&D spending partially offset by operational improvements and also from lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.", "Other expenses on an adjusted basis in the second quarter were $30.3 million compared to $21.3 million last year in the second quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher interest expense and these expenses are expected to run at a similar level throughout the rest of this year.", "Our reported and adjusted tax rate for the second quarter was 22.4%. This compares to a 23.5% adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter last year. We expect the full year rate will be approximately 22.5% with a slightly lower rate in the second half of the year. The renewal of the tax extenders is still reflected in our year-end earnings forecast, which if approved will help reduce the second half tax rate. No renewal benefit has been included in our first half actuals.", "While our 2014 guidance still includes approximately $0.05 per share for the renewal of the tax extenders, it has not yet been approved by Congress and renewal and timing of them is still uncertain. We also expect some tax rate benefit from our European regional headquarter move beginning in the third quarter of this year. We officially opened our new European headquarters in Amsterdam in the beginning of this month and will be ramping up activities and transferring some intellectual property to the Netherlands as we move through 2014 and into 2015 which will require some local tax country repayments.", "This move will also generate some tax benefits which are expected to further reduce our overall adjusted operating tax rate in 2015 by approximately two full percentage points from 2014's full year rate. Currently, we are expecting to reinvest approximately half of these savings directly into our business.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also have $3.9 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 57 days or about one day better than the end of the second quarter last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 177 days, which was an 11 day increase compared 166 days in the second quarter last year. While inventory levels increased in the first half of the year, partially in support the Japanese ERP implementation and recent acquisitions, we do expect some improvements in the back half of the year.", "Turning to cash flow. Our cash from operations in the first half of 2014 were $572 million compared $592 million in the prior year. First half cash flows were slightly lower than last year as inventory increased in the period including amounts to support the ERP implementation in Japan. Our capital expenditures were $124 million in the first half of the year, compared to $96 million last year.", "We still have over $600 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization as $60 million of share repurchases were made in the quarter as we focused on and closed a few acquisitions in the period. As Kevin mentioned, our 2014 sales guidance includes organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6% and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.12 to $1.16 and $4.75 to $4.80 for the third quarter and full year, respectively. This guidance includes the negative $0.02 per share impact of recently announced acquisitions. Also as mentioned previously, the renewal of the tax extenders remains in our guidance, however, if these are not renewed it would have a negative impact on our current guidance of approximately $0.05 per share for the year.", "Thanks for your support and we would be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). The first question comes to Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Thank you and thanks for taking the questions. Let me start with just the guidance change for the year. Since the street was already there, someone from the streets, that's a bit of a surprise, but they are going to range. So maybe you could provide a bridge from your own plan to where you are? Where you are up to date? The year-end $0.02 of that was from the recent acquisitions but maybe you can provide the rest?", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. I think that the primary reason on our guidance, as you saw, in the first half of the year, our performance was a little bit softer than what we would like to have seen. Again we had $0.02 that we just recently announced as a negative impact from some of the recent acquisitions that we have got and pricing has been running a little bit stronger, a little bit higher from a negative impact perspective, or at least at the top end of our 1.5% to 2% range that we have typically given. Also as you have noted, in the first part of this year, FX has had about a $0.06 to $0.07 negative impact on us year-over-year at this point in time.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. Can you spend a minute, Katherine on SBi, to adding people, the sales there have kind of flattened out for over a bit, but your outlook has been pretty optimistic. So can you just talk about what takes that from a business that's not growing right now to one that has that 20% growth potential?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, and you are correct. We are receiving some sales force or some sales dis-synergy as we integrated into our business and there was clearly some distraction they had as we were working through this transaction. It really is a playbook as we saw with Memometal and other deals where we take great products and this is a terrific upper extremity portfolio really led by the STAR ankle, which is a meaningful gap in our foot and ankle portfolio and leveraging our considerable sales and marketing infrastructure, the demonstrated strength of the hybrid sales channel that we have that really allows us to touch base with all the various surgical specialists that participate in this market segment. So we really think we can reverse this trend with a tremendous amount of momentum as you are seeing right now in extremities and foot and ankle and adding this key gap to the portfolio and also further broadening out our upper extremity offerings. We feel very confident about the ability to return momentum there, which is why we are targeting that north of 20% CAGR for this segment.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Rick Wise - Stifel", "Good afternoon, everybody. I guess, first with knees. Can you help us understand a little more clearly. Maybe actually I will start again. Can you talk a little about the knee market environment? One of your competitors is talking about the environment being soft or slow. Maybe you can give us some general perspective there?", "And the follow-up with that, what would knee growth have been excluding Japan or maybe help us understand the impact of pricing and ERP implementation on worldwide knees? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Rick, I will take the first part. I would say whether its hips or knees, we are continuing to see a market that's very stable. We did see sequential improvement in our business as you would anticipate given the challenges that existed for the industry mainly due to weather in the first quarter, but overall the market trends are very stable. We did have contribution from MAKO but even excluding that, our underlying growth in both hips and knees was solid. So we are pleased with the performance of those business. We did comment that pricing has gotten incrementally tougher which is behind the total pricing being down at the high end of our anticipated range. But that really doesn't reflect any significant changes in the market. It's much more of a function of the timing of product launches, where we are, for example, with Accolade II and that impacts that pricing from quarter to quarter. So I wouldn't view that as some type of fundamental change in the market, which we continue to view both segments as very stable.", "Kevin Lobo", "Also keep in mind that as we noted earlier, this quarter does have one less selling day in it as well too. So the organic growth rate that we talked about are on a straight basis. And those are not a days adjusted number.", "Katherine Owen", "And then you made the comment. We did have the price cuts in Japan which was part of the pressure on that business and as well as Kevin noted the ERP implementation. So those have been two of the more noteworthy challenges for that business.", "Kevin Lobo", "And ERP implementations, as you all know, can be challenging. And for us, it had a disproportionate impact on our reconstructive business because of the sets and being able to track all the inventory. So we put more resources on it right now. In fact, I also hired a new CIO for all of Stryker, Bijoy Sagar, who came from Merck KGaA. He joined us in the second quarter. We are really excited to have him onboard. We do also have another ERP planned for our instruments division as we modernize all of our IT systems. But having a new CIO, I am extremely excited about. We do have a lot of work to do. We made progress in addressing the ERP over the quarter, but it did have a disproportionate impact on hips and knees, and we are optimistic that we will have that sorted out in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. I have got a question to start for Bill and then one for Kevin. First for Bill. I was just wondering if you can go back to beginning of the year? Your guidance has been at the lower end of the range. You have revised it to the lower end of the range a few times and I am just wondering, is this all really surprises on currency and the $0.02 from the deal? Or is there something else going on?", "And then on the 2015 outlook, which we appreciate, does that suggest a little upward bias to consensus, which is now forecasting 11% growth?", "Bill Jellison", "So I would say that you are exactly right in the first half of the year. So the $0.02 that we just talked about on the acquisition that we highlighted as far as having $0.02 of an impact as we move into the back half of this year is one piece of it. The other piece is some slight additional impact on FX in comparison to what we had in our original guidance as we talked about. Most of that, obviously, is impacting really the first part of this year as FX rates have actually improved a little bit, except for in some of the emerging market areas now. And then on the third piece is really that the pricing impact primarily in the recon area was probably a little bit higher, at least within the first half of the year than what we really expected.", "Katherine Owen", "And then, Bob, just in terms of your question, we will give our guidance in January. So it would be premature for us to comment regarding what the consensus expectations are. But you are correct. You should view the $0.05 to $0.08 that we referenced as being incremental to the normal targets that we will set out at the start of the year.", "Operator", "Then next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "John Demchak - Morgan Stanley", "Hello, this is actually John Demchak, in for David. I wanted to follow-up on some of the prior guidance questions with focus, I guess, a bit more on the organic growth adjustments. Numbers show the company's average roughly 4% to 5% organic growth in the first half of the year. Obviously the increased seasonality and weather had a pretty large impact in the first quarter. Are expectations that organic growth should stay more at the 2Q levels heading into the back half? Or are there some puts and takes that we should be thinking about that could drive organic growth a bit higher?", "Kevin Lobo", "So a couple of points. First, keep in mind that the Q2 growth that we just talked about was on a one day less selling day basis. So the adjusted basis in the second quarter was actually north of 6%. And I say that if you look at our organic growth in the first half, which was just under 5% as reported, and we just now obviously raised slightly the broader-based or near the range on the top end to 5% to 6%. That obviously implies that our second half growth rate is expected to be higher than what we have experienced so far in the first half. One of the reasons associated with that, as I mentioned, is on the instruments. The impact of Neptune on the back half of last year was obviously stronger than the first half and obviously as we are moving in through this year, our Neptune sales should actually be stronger in the second half of the year than they were in the first half of the year. So that's one piece that's helping to drive that but I think that we are feeling good and confident in a number of our different business areas to continue to take market share.", "John Demchak - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. Very helpful. And just wanted to follow-up on U.S. knee growth. As earlier competitor reports showed weaker growth in U.S. in knees than we would have expected, but your numbers showed some pretty nice sequential improvement, especially when you factor in the selling day. I was wondering if you could discuss what you see in the market competitively and if you expect growth to pick up further later in the year with increased seasonality?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. I would just go back to our prior comments. The market feels very stable. We obviously don't have the benefit of everybody having reported results right now. But for us, we are very pleased with the sequential improvement. And we are happy also with making progress on MAKO. So both underlying and with MAKO, we are seeing improving trends. I wouldn't say we have seen an acceleration in the underlying average growth for the recon market. It feels very much like a market that's been growing at fairly consistent rates, recognizing we have the variability between Q4 and Q1 that exists.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So one follow-up, if I could, on MAKO. If you are providing a little more colors to and you see the rollout playing out nest year with knees, and then also with hips. I would love to understand, you mentioned sales trading, what's the model going to look like? Perhaps if you could shed any light on maybe how you are integrating the robot sales with recon sales and the support, as well as whether you are anticipating any significant upgrade to the hip software. That kind of color would be helpful. And then I have one follow-up.", "Kevin Lobo", "So I will take this questions. So what I say is, at the Analyst Day we are going to provide a lot more insight into MAKO. What I would tell you is from a sales force structure, we have a dedicated capital sales force that's within our orthopedic group that sells capital and that implants are being sold by our entire implant sales force. So that is now of course a much larger sales force than MAKO had initially. They all have gotten the same compensation plan starting April 1. So we didn't have that benefit in the first quarter. The training that Katherine alluded to in her section relates to training of the implant sales force on the benefits of MAKO, so they can be prepared to sell the implants that go with the robot. And of course going into 2015, those implants will include the Stryker implants and we will share more specifics on that at the Analyst Day.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Great, and the follow-up, I guess, I appreciate the color on the ortho sequential growth. It seems very encouraging. Spine, on the other hand, still having trouble getting going and as you mentioned some sales disruptions, I am wondering maybe if you have any timing as to when we can start to see that curve bend up a little bit on the spine business.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. So up to now, up until this quarter, we have been really holding our own very well in spine, growing at least at the high-end of the large multinational. So not the spine only companies. We have been actually holding our own and actually running a very good business from a top and bottomline standpoint. We have had some sales force disruptions that the market is incredibly aggressive out there. That obviously hurt us in the second quarter. This market is still a market that rewards innovation and we are seeing that already with the early response to CoAlign. So getting our pipeline back on track is really going to be critical to us to not only retain the sales force that we have but also to drive growth. So I would say it's going to take us a good part of this year to really get ourselves back on a strong footing. And then I really look forward to a much more optimistic 2015 in spine. But it's a tough market, certainly especially in the United States. Outside the U.S., it's frankly not nearly as competitive and the markets are lot more stable.", "Then getting back to your first question. I don't think I answered the last part of your first question around the hip. I would say, the recent hip software launch on MAKO is actually really good. So the software itself, the early iterations certainly had some challenges, but we now have actually a very nice software iteration. The issue for us is now getting our implants on to the robot. And as Katherine mentioned, we plan to do that in 2015.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, at AAOS last year, you were incredibly bullish about MAKO and you kind of went through the line of arguments as to why it provides a better option with modestly modified implants. Now you have a little experience under your belt. Could you kindly give us the elevator pitch for knees and hips with MAKO and what's really resonating with customers?", "Kevin Lobo", "The elevator pitch is the same elevator pitch I gave at the academy. I honestly feel as bullish as I did then and now and obviously we have got integration, we have issues with our sales force getting them all of up-to-date but I would say the promise of robotic surgery is the same. Its precision, its reproducibility, its consistent results and we are seeing in terms of the knee in particular, which is much more challenging than hips, we see this as really having a tremendous potential and we are obviously in the midst of our trial right now on the total knee and anecdotally we have a certain amount of feedback around being able to do intraoperative adjustments. It just provides a much better solution to the procedure, which we know is a very complex procedure, which has high, high variability and not the same degree of patient satisfaction. So obviously, there's the link to improving patient satisfaction is a long link but we believe the surgeon experience will be a tremendous with that. So there is nothing thus far in terms of the integration that's caused me to feel any less optimistic. Mind you, this is going to take time. It takes time to sell the capital. It takes time to put the implants that we want the robot and we would be rolling that over a period of time. But I remain extremely bullish on the opportunity long-term.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "And just on financially philosophical basis, I guess you guys have engineered a mini inversion of sorts with a nice tax advantage that should be sustainable, but with regards to access to ex-U.S. cash, how big a lingering problem is that and how big an enticement is inversion, generally speaking?", "Kevin Lobo", "Inversions are, obviously, in the news a lot lately, but from an overall perspective, we think we have made some very good progress on our RHQ structure related activities, which is primarily focused on the business itself and bringing the benefits of being able to grow our overall European business. But it does have some benefits to us within the tax side of the equation as well and we are very confident that we are going to be able to deliver on the results that we just talked about. Those results are on an ongoing basis. So we are continually focused and obviously minimizing our tax rate within that area and operating our of business as effectively as we can. We think we still have good opportunities in the future.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you. It's Joanne Wuensch. Can we focus on two things? First gross margins. What is the take to turn those? Or should we think of the 66% level as the go forward rate? Then my second question has to deal with (inaudible), and I appreciate the organic growth rate of up 5% to 6%, but you made a bunch of acquisition in the last six months, in six to 12 months. How do I think of what that may add on top of that? Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "Let me answer the last question first and I will go back to the first question. But from a growth rate perspective, keep in mind the organic growth rate that we are talking about excludes those acquisitions, with the exception now of Trauson is beginning to be included in our organic numbers, because that's an annualized acquisition. All the other recent acquisitions that we have are not in our current organic growth rate, but obviously should help improve our overall organic growth rate as we continue and move forward over the next number of years. From an overall perspective, on the margin rate side of the equation, I would say that our expectation for the rest of this year is still that the gross margins will probably be softer than they were last year throughout the rest of this year. However we are still expecting that our SG&A related activities will also run much better as well than they did last year. The biggest pressure on the margin rates right now is really price. The price impact was probably about not quite half of the total impact in that margin rate at this stage and we think the back half of this year, at least from a pricing perspective should be a little bit better than what the first half ran.", "Katherine Owen", "And Joanne, just maybe a little bit more color commentary. We talked about the sequential improvement in MAKO going to fix placements in the quarter. You should assume that's going to accelerate in the back half of the year as we train the remaining 80% of our reps on the technology and that's part of what is driving the accelerated revenue expectations. Also try to give some color on some of the key data points, whether its new contracts we have added or expanding our customer base with some of the other acquisitions, recognizing the revenue contribution there is certainly lower. So we tend to focus on organic growth since it really is the best indicator of our underlying gains but there is clearly an expectation for an acceleration in the contribution from the acquisitions with the exception of SBi given the dis-synergies we noted in 2014.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Katherine Owen", "Sorry about that, Bob. We dropped you off before you asked your second question. Our apologies.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "No problem, and I had a problem with my phones. So thank you, and I understand there has been some discussions around inversions. But I wanted to ask Kevin a question specifically, and obviously there has been a lot of press lately about inversions and day before yesterday, we had some statements out of President Obama's administration. I am just wondering if those comments about inversions, if that might cause, in your view, companies might be considering inversion to be less likely to move forward, given the changing political environment? Just love your views on that, Kevin.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. Thanks, Bob. I think it really depends on the main reason for doing the transaction. As you know, some of the deals that been done have been done really largely for financial reasons. In those cases, I think those companies would probably, it's a cause for pause, if the main driver of the deal is financial. However if the deals are more strategically driven, I really don't see it having much of an impact at all until legislation is actually enacted and what we are seeing in the press is the likelihood of near-term legislation doesn't seem very probable. So again, I would bifurcate into two areas. Those that are very financially driven, I think those companies will pause a little bit. Those that really are strategically, that's a bigger part of the logic and then as an inversion as maybe icing, I think those will continue to be pursued.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "Great, I really appreciate your perspective. Thanks for letting me back in.", "Kevin Lobo", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Matthew Dodds from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "Good afternoon. On the pricing side, Bill, should we think about this as being geographically an issue at Japan and then hips and knees are the rest of the product lines geographies kind of stable or holding in there?", "Bill Jellison", "Well, I would say that Japan was one piece of it. But I would say that and it's within our general range. We expect the price is going to be somewhere in the 1.5% to 2% on average in any year. I think the first half was probably a little bit higher toward the top end of our range, but the whole year, I think it's probably still going to be in the 1.5% to 2% range. But I think that if you look at where the business related impacts are, while Japan is a piece of it, I think the broader recon group was probably at least beyond the higher impacted area of our business.", "Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "Okay, and then Kevin on foot and ankle, you gave another big growth rate number. But you didn't say this time to caution us to not expect it going forward.", "Kevin Lobo", "You know what, you just defined my expectations. Honestly, it is hard to predict, these new markets are hard to predict. And I keep waiting for the comps to start to catch up with us and the team keeps executing. So I will be honest. They are exceeding my expectations and I am really delighted with the results.", "Katherine Owen", "But with that, we do remind you the comps will get tougher.", "Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "The quick question is, why do you think the market growth is still above 10%, though, in extremities broadly?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, I would say we tend to estimate it around between 10% and 15%. We are certainly outperforming in the lower extremities. Obviously the upper extremities, shoulder has been a soft spot for us historically and we now have our reverse shoulder out, which we are very excited about. But that's an area we are playing catch-up in upper extremities. But obviously in the foot and ankle area, we are just having a great time so far and obviously the total, that was about the total ankle. We have been growing 30% pretty much quarter after quarter for a number of quarters without a total ankle and we believe we have got a fantastic total ankle through this acquisition. Of course we haven't closed yet but we will be closing soon, and we really believe that's a perfect solution for us and frankly gives us access to a lot of us the surgeons that we haven't had access to the fellowship trained foot and ankle surgeons. We have been kind of on the sidelines. So it really does give us a shot in the arm.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on that discussion right there with the total ankle in your lower extremities portfolio. Now that you have filled out your last remaining gap, do you think that, and now that you see this great opportunity in front of you, do you feel that the current sales force that you have is sufficient or do you expect to make further investment into your sales force to drive that growth moving forward?", "Katherine Owen", "We do have a hybrid model and we also have distributors as well as direct agents and that model has worked very well between our trauma, our reconstructive hybrid reps and our dedicated foot and ankle reps. Over time, we will look to possibly reevaluate the approach in upper extremities and it's possible but at this point as we analyze all the call points we have and the breadth of the various aspects of our selling organization, we think we are pretty well covered. So we don't believe we need to set up another dedicated sales force given the moves we have already made on that front.", "Kevin Lobo", "Certainly for the lower extremities, foot and ankle, we may add a rep here or there, but we don't need a radical change. We have a really well organized footprint a couple of years ago when we decided to create a dedicated sales force calling on the podiatric surgeon, that we have the right numbers, more or less. Again we may add a few reps here or there to fill out certain areas, but I wouldn't expect anything significant from a sales force investment standpoint. This is just getting great products and plugging it right in to our existing sales force.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford Bernstein", "Got it. Thanks. For my second question, I wanted to turn over to the MedSurg business and in particular, I was wondering if you could comment a bit on the capital, the CapEx spending environment for the hospitals? We have seen, it looks like their bed business picked up a little bit, but maybe if you could just comment there on what your outlook is for the remainder of the year and what you are seeing in the marketplace. Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Derrick. I would tell you right now, that the capital environment still remains pretty stable. And by that, I mean it's still challenged as it relates some of the prioritization that our hospital customers do. And this is most relevant for our medical business which is 90% plus capital. We did report 3% growth. So it remains stable and we are pleased with the performance on a relative basis, but I wouldn't tell you we have seen any change in underlying capital demands on a high level as it relates to whether it's from ACA. That said, we are seeing very solid growth with our 1488 camera and have strong double-digit gains there and as well as System 7. So all capital is not the same, but as your comments are really towards the bigger tick at capital, I would say it's stable but no signs of an acceleration or increased investments by hospitals there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to come back to the topic around orthopedic pricing. I think that J&J talked about this pretty explicitly within the U.S. business. Maybe you could just offer a little bit more perspective on, if there are any significant structural change you are seeing in the pricing environment? I think if you look at other MedTech markets, there were pretty good leading indicator to see when pricing was going to turn negative, like high levels of physician employment and vendor consolidation. But is anything that you are seeing really change in the market? And what would you be confidence? Is this sort of a one-off flip or something that could worsen from here?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. Thanks for the question, and you could imagine, we do a lot of analysis as we see how pricing trends are changing and it's clearly in the range of 1.5% to 2% but it's at the high-end and obviously if we think this is indicative of a fundamental change in the pricing environment, it's going to require us to think about things differently. So we really go into the next level of analysis and see the impact of the timing of product launches, expected product launches going forward and we feel very confident that what we are seeing is the normal quarter-to-quarter variation that occurs. We get price premium when we launch something like Accolade II, which had a very nice ramp up. But we have anniversaried that. So it would start to see the impact on pricing as a result of that. So all of that analysis that we do throughout the quarter, leads us to believe that this is consistent with the normal quarter-to-quarter variability that can exist. We tend to look over a rolling four quarters, because that gives you the best sense of the underlying trends but we don't think we have seen some fundamental change in the pricing environment that suggest we are going to see a significant step down in recon pricing.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. That's helpful. Maybe a follow-up on the neurovascular business, which continues to do extremely well. Maybe you could just give us some update on end-market trends. I know back in March, there is that New England Journal of Medicine article that caused some disruption at your competitor, but you have powered right through that. So maybe if you could just give us sense in where end-market dynamics are right now and how we should think about that business on a go forward basis?", "Katherine Owen", "Sure. If I focus on the neurovascular part, because that's clearly the biggest piece of the overall neurotech business. We continue to be really pleased. We participate in both the hemorrhagic and ischemic segment. Although hemorrhagic is really the revenue growth driver and it's really the target line that continues to-date additional share in each geographic region. We have added four line extensions since the original launch of the Target coil a few years back and that still is the bulk of the neurovascular market, upwards of 40% and we have absolutely taken meaningful market share year-over-year in the coil market. We are also launching into new geographies with the product lineup, whether it's the Target XL which is the larger size or the Target Nano, which we are introducing into the Japanese market. So it's really continuing to execute on that plan.", "The ischemic segment, it does take more investment to help develop that market and make sure you are getting patients to the right mode of care and it's really an emerging market, very much so, as it relates to the mechanical-based treatment of stroke segment. But we are very excited about the longer-term prospects. So we are going to continue with that playbook. I am just very pleased with the pace of product rollout and our ability to continue to launch them into new geographies.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. I would just like to add. We have an absolutely outstanding management team in neurovascular and you have seen our R&D spending, as a company, has certainly ticked up. Part of the reason for that uptick is spending that we have done in neurovascular, which is clearly yielding benefits and we still have a robust pipeline beyond the products that Katherine alluded to that we had already launched. So we feel very, very bullish about this business going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions on spine. First, you called out pricing pressure in your spinal segment. Can you tell us what that pricing pressure was and how that compares to the overall market, given your pricing was? Was the pricing more severe?", "And then second, strategically in spine do you feel like you have now all the technologies to be competitive with, for example, a J&J or Medtronic or is this a segment where we should anticipate more M&A? Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. So firstly on pricing. It's not a new trend. It's been a consistent trend where pricing is worse in the U.S. than it is globally, kind of down in the mid-single-digit range and globally, maybe low single-digit or more stable pricing. Our challenge in spine really is, that our position in MIS segments, and clearly the CoAlign acquisition was one step to help plug some of that gap. We were really well represented in broad-based in the scoliosis procedures, pedicle screws, the standard spinal fusion products. We are very well represented but in MIS areas, we have been launching a series of new products over the last 18 months. We have more products to come but those won't be launched before the end of this year. So it will have more of an impact in 2015. So I would continue to expect that either through internal innovation or through potential acquisitions that that's an area that we will be focused on, growing our presence in MIS portion of spine. And frankly, that's what caused us some of our challenges.", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you, Kevin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I will try to be brief. So Kevin, you guys have done a lot of acquisitions in the first half of the year. Just on the same M&A topic, should we expect you guys to be active in the second half as well?", "Katherine Owen", "We would tell you that our BD activity ebbs and flows. There have been periods, if you go back a couple of years, where we did one transaction in the entire year despite having dedicated BD people in every one of our division. So it's impossible to time. We are focused on BD. We have it throughout the organization and we will probably have periods where a lot happens all at once, because that's just the nature of BD. But there is no change in the underlying strategy. M&A, for us, is the use of cash, dividends and buybacks.", "Kevin Lobo", "You know that our organization, the way we are structured, is we have business development people in each of our division. So they are always scouring the market and constantly looking at targets. We are not stopping that activity. That doesn't predict that we will do a certain number of deals, but the ongoing activity doesn't stop. Whether a division is ready to absorb another one is obviously one of the factors that will be considered, but we have so many divisions within the company that we can take on multiple deals at one time.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo", "Thank you, and then lastly, on the shoulder launch. Could you just give us an update on where you are with that? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "We launched the reverse shoulder during Q2 and really going into Q3 as we start to get it out there. It's a different market than the other extremity areas, foot and ankle, for example, that is very much a market expansion segment. So we are seeing growth as we gain share, but also just the overall expansion of that market. That's not the case for shoulder. You have got more established players there and a much lower underlying growth, but it was a key gap in our portfolio. It was very difficult to go in without having the full product offering that a surgeon may need and you have only got one option for them. So we are excited about the ability to introduce that product to our hybrid reconstructive sales force, but I would have more tempered expectations, just given the nature of the market and the establishment of existing players.", "Kevin Lobo", "And really in the second quarter, it was more on a limited launch basis, with a certain set of surgeons. The full launch will really occur sometime by the end of the third quarter.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair", "Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, I was just looking across your portfolio, it seems like you have a pretty well-rounded product offering across recon, MedSurg and elsewhere. I am just curious about your thoughts on the need in areas where you are already participating to get a lot bigger versus just continuing to internally invest in those areas and organically growing and if you have ever seen a situation where one of your bigger competitors, like a J&J, just given their larger say, in trauma, has been able to cloud you across you out because of their size, rather than just their product offering?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, I think the only example of trauma that you highlight is actually good example because their size and strength would simply certainly isn't slowing us down and our ability to grow. If you look at our growth over the last eight quarters, being number two hasn't really been a problem for us. We are growing at a very robust rate. So the key is you want to be one of the leaders in a segment and we like to be very strong in orthopedics and it narrows service line of hospitals, especially in surgery. We want to make sure we have very strong position or a path to be in a strong position. So you know our portfolio, you know within some of our portfolio, we don't have a number one or two position, and in those areas you can imagine that we are going to want to get to that kind of position over a period of time, whether it is through internal innovation. Trauma is a story of around internal innovation, largely, but one small acquisition of Memometal for the most part internally, we pulled away from the pack five years ago. Synthes was the dominant number one and then everybody else was tied for two, and we completely pulled away from the pack and we did that internally. Sometimes we will have to do it through acquisitions, and we are not going to disclose which of the approaches we will use in those segments where we are lower but for the most part, most of our portfolio, we feel that we are punching at our weight and we are really in a strong position to compete. In the case of hips and knees, we obviously felt that robotics was going to be a really key lever for us to drive above market growth. That may be different in other spaces where we might choose to do an acquisition just to increase our scale. But we have very few areas where we are really at a distant gap from the leaders and in those segments you can imagine that we will be active.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair", "Okay. Thank you and then just one more on the spine side of things. You mentioned a pretty competitive environment as far some of your sales force disruptions go. Is that a function of some of these guarantees getting to be fairly high levels? And is that coming from some of the really small providers out there or some the bigger multinational multiproduct companies?", "Kevin Lobo", "I would say absolutely, you are right on with the guarantees. That's the big reason that we are having some sales force departures, are very large guarantees, and frankly it's coming from multiple players. So it's not just smaller spine only. It's even some of the other players. So that hit us in towards the middle to end of the first quarter and that had more of an impact in the second quarter. It's a tough market. It's not a new tough market. It has been a tough market for a long time. It will continue to be a tough market and we are just to make sure that we stay focused. We made some adds to our leadership team that I feel really positive about and I think will be in good shape going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. You guys have been making pretty good progress on reducing SG&A and I was just wondering to what extent you feel that this level of reduction is sustainable given all the initiatives underway and if the European headquarters will also have an impact on any sort of SG&A spending there?", "And then separately, you mentioned giving back some of the incremental offsets on the taxes. Where exactly are those investments going to go? Are those internal or through acquisitions?", "Kevin Lobo", "So I would say, a couple things. As you look toward the back half of this year, we still feel very good about what type of improvements that you should see from an SG&A perspective year-over-year. So you should continue to see nice improvements there. And I think that from an overall perspective, especially if we can continue to drive above market growth, which we are doing on a number of different product related categories, that obviously helps us to continue to leverage that space and I think you should expect that as we are moving forward.", "From an overall perspective on the tax comment that we made, I think it's more of an awareness that one, we are expecting some nice improvements from the tax rate side of the equation and our expectation is that we are going to be spending some of that as we move forward but I think that's more of wait and see related response based on how well the business is doing and what type of areas that we think that would like to invest in and I think you will get more color on that as we move through the back half of this year.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "And with respect to tax, should we look at this as just the start of what could be additional reduction beyond 2015? Or is this one step function and that's basically it?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, I would say, that we have made very good progress in the tax area to begin with. This project is just another big step associated with that and the improvements that we are expecting to get over the next couple of years, we are obviously still driving to maximize that level and it will take us kind of a couple of years to truly get the full benefit associated with even the projects that we are currently working on. Moving forward, beyond that, obviously while our efforts will be strong in that area, there is also many, many pressures around the world through a number of different jurisdictions and trying to increase different tax revenue in different areas. So that's a challenging environment, but I think that we are well positioned and I think we still have a lot of good opportunities.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Kevin, I was wondering on the extremities market, your comment of 10% to 15% market growth. I was wondering if you could maybe go even a little deeper in the weeds there on the ankle replacement market? Maybe how you see the ankle replacement market itself growing in the U.S. and Europe? And then on your comments on STAR, on that ankle product. We have been hearing about maybe some early revisions with that product, a decline in utilization because of that in some markets. Obviously you see a lot more of that business than the few anecdotal conversations we had. So maybe you could set me straight on some of the things we have been hearing out on the field on that product?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. So first thing I would say is, if you look at the total joint replacement in general, the ankle is one of the late bloomers. So you have knees and hips and shoulders and it took time before it really started to get traction before the growth really kicked in and a lot of people predicted the total ankle would take a much, much larger percentage of the procedures which today, as you know, is mostly fusion. People predicted that five, six, seven years ago. We now really see the market starting to be primed for a take off.", "Now predicting these take offs, as we have proven with our own foot and ankle, those other products, is not easy to predict when it will take off and what pace of take off. But we really believe that this is like the early stages of hips and knees. That's kind of what's been happening in the total ankle market. We believe the market is really primed to start to improve.", "This is the most published ankle on the market. It has tremendous data. So the anecdotes, as you hear a lot of the anecdotes at least from our point of view, it really relates to the sales force execution and the service and we really believe we are getting a fantastic product out there. It's the most published by far. The data is long-term in nature and very, very solid.", "You always hear anecdotes about different products. A lot of times, our competitors are the ones that will throw those anecdotes around and so we are not worried about it. We have done our due diligence. Believe me, we have known we have a gap in total ankle for some time and we have been very deliberative about making sure we make the right choice. We believe we made the right choice and having a cementless PMA approved total ankle, we believe, is a real competitive advantage and now putting it in our sales force's hands will change the story in terms of the growth trajectory that's currently being pursued in the market.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Yes, understood. Thank you. And then, Katherine, maybe for my follow-up. I just wanted to be clear on what you are saying on MAKO and your implants. You are saying jus the Stryker hip itself by 2015, I think is what you are saying, and I think that's a little bit of a change in the path. I think you have been little coy on whether it would be Stryker implant or the Restoration implant, what might get approved, not approved on MAKO. Can you just set me straight on Stryker implant, hip, knee, timing of expectations on that again?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, you correct. It's incremental information. We really tried to say that as we get better clarity, we will share information with you. So at this point, we do feel comfortable that we will be launching, Stryker hip on the MAKO system in 2015. We will probably get into more specifics at the Analyst Meeting, and regarding specific hip systems. The knee system, there is no change. The trial is underway. We continue to expect to launch a total knee on the MAKO in 2015. We haven't got any more specific on the timing of that yet. The trial is being done with the pipeline knee that was MAKO's knee system. We do believe there is a regulatory path that may not require a completely new trial to bring our own knee systems on to the MAKO robot in 2015. But I would say, the probability of that is less than pipeline which is the knee being used in the trial. So new information on hips, more details to come in September and no change to our thinking on knees.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matt Taylor - Barclays", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had two more strategic questions. So I guess the first one is, you made some comments over the past few months over the benefits of scale but maybe not scope yet. And I was just curious, over the past couple of years, you have made a lot of acquisitions to diversify away from recon. How do you view the benefits of scale in recon and how do think that the Zimmer. Biomet deal could impact your business positively or negatively, if it does close?", "Kevin Lobo", "So the characterization that we did a lot of acquisitions to diversify away from recon, certainly since I have been the CEO, it's really about strengthening our businesses. Strengthening our businesses within orthopedics, within neuro and within specialty surgery. And I am really agnostic about how we strengthen those businesses. So MAKO is a deal that's absolutely within reconstructive. Trauson is a deal that's a orthopedic deal. Then we have done deals that are outside in endoscopy and in another division. So I would say, certainly I wouldn't want anybody to think that our focus on acquisitions is to diversify away from. It's really to strengthen all of our existing businesses. Certainly, this consolidation within recon is something that we have been anticipating. It's not a big surprise, the Zimmer, Biomet, that that would happen. Having five competitors in a market that's not growing close to double digits normally would lead to some form of consolidation. So it's not totally surprising. The market has been pretty well disciplined thus far and we expect that that will add extra discipline to that. And I think that's about all that I would say on that.", "Matt Taylor - Barclays", "Thanks, and then just a follow-up. Your earlier comments on China, I thought were interesting and you have kind of a tiered structure there and some strong presence in both the premium and value segment. I guess I am just curious as you look out over the next couple of years, how are you going to continue to grow and defend your share? Are you concerned about emerging market players or your \"generic orthopedic devices\" or is that too small to be concerned with at this point?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. We feel really excited about the prospects within China, because certainly regardless of what happens with China's overall GDP, the healthcare market in China will be very healthy for the future and there's significant growth to be had both within the premium segment as well as in the value segment. Local players will continue to pop up in the lower-priced segment, but to have a well-rounded and very, very diverse product bag is critical. A lot of the business happens through tenders and to be able to win the tender, you need a strong brand, a strong local brand, which we have with Trauson, that has very, very broad product portfolio and registration times are not easy. The reason we moved towards acquisition was, we could have done it ourselves, it would have taken us six or seven years and we probably wouldn't have had products at lower price with the kind of heritage that we were able to get through the acquisition. So we really believe it has a long runway in front of us. Ramesh Subrahmanian, our Group President for International is going to do a deep dive on China at the Analyst Day Meeting and really our biggest opportunity, certainly in the next couple of years beyond China is taking Trauson to other countries which we are starting to do this year and which we will share more in the future, but there is markets like India that have big trauma markets where we don't even play in today. We are planning to launch into Trauson in 2015 in India and many other emerging markets where we have trauma markets where Stryker has not historically played. To us, that's a very, very significant growth potential for the long-term.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Mike Matson - Needham & Company", "Thanks. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the commission rate changes that you made in the recon business? I guess I am wondering, number one, was that limited to just recon or have you gone through similar moves in some of your other businesses? And then number two, how big of an impact has that had in the SG&A levers that we have seen this year? And is this something that you can continue to ratchet down in future years?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I would say, we did the commission rate cut for our recon sales forces in the U.S. at the start of the first quarter. We intend to do rate adjustment every few years. So it would have been three, four years since the last time. We recognize that we were above markets. So we moved in more line with the market and structured it to have a greater focus on growth. And that was one of the factors that we talked about the first quarter call that led to some of the softness on the recon business. It's clearly part of what's helping to drive the SG&A leverage. It's not all of it, but it's clearly a component of it. The rest of our businesses, MedSurg's does commission rate adjustments as well. They tend to do it more on an incremental basis, more frequently. Each of the businesses have their own approach to it. And there has been really no change that in fact was felt in some of the disruption around. It really was a first quarter effect.", "Mike Matson - Needham & Company", "Okay, and then just on the hedging program. Will that be fully in place by 2015? In other words, when we get into 2015, will these be pretty significant or potentially significant currency impacts on your gross margin be over effectively?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, they are obviously never over because the exchange rates are always moving, right. So the hedging program is really just meant to mitigate that risk. It just buffers the impact with between quarters and try to smooth those increases, all right. It doesn't avoid the increases. So as those increases change over time, obviously that's an impact that occurs over time. Should you at least eliminate the peaks and the valleys associated with those movements, absolutely. The full program will probably be in place by probably mid-year, next year where we have got full six layer hedges consistently in place moving forward from that point.", "Operator", "The last question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners", "Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. Kevin, can you talk maybe just about how you envision MAKO potentially creating advantages for Stryker's recon sales organization through efficiency or enhanced flexibility either in the OR or outside of the OR?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, I will go back to all of the comments we have made around the rationale for doing the deal is you deliver a delightful experience for the surgeon. The surgeon is able to produce consistent placement of the implant intraoperative adjustments and once they have that experience and we believe again the total knee will be the most promising. Certainly a bicruciate sparing knees becomes a big part of the market. We believe robotics will play beautifully into that. But it will be one of those situations, just like what happened with in the Uni market, where MAKO was able to take almost 20% share within a four year period. Once a surgeon does it robotically and has a delightful experience, they are not going back. So we will be the only game in town. So for us, it's a very differentiated approach that provides a meaningful benefit. A lot of those benefits, we believe, over time we are going to have to prove it with certain clinical trials, which we will be doing, but a lot of it's intuitive and obvious. It makes this procedure easier to do. It makes it more consistent. It makes it more reproducible and certainly once we put the Stryker implants with the robot, we have done a lot of research before we did the acquisition and surgeons were very interest in robotics. If you look at our manufacturing plants, you walk through Stryker's manufacturing plants, you see robots everywhere. And why is that? Well, robots can produce cleaner, more consistent results. It's just undeniable. And therefore we really believe bringing this to surgery is a logical extension and MAKO proved it already once with the Uni and we are going to now have to prove it in other procedures. And we feel very optimistic about being able to do so.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners", "So maybe just my second question to follow-up on the first one. I was talking a little bit more just about the selling model, so to speak, or does it provide you with increased flexibility to drive efficiency through your sales organization itself, the way they itself interact with the physician, et cetera?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, sure. So, the way it works for robotic procedures, is you have a technician that helps operate the robot and that technician is not a regular commissioned sales person. So they are paid at a much different price point than our typical commissioned salesperson. And once the surgeon is converted and actually does their procedures robotically, you don't really need that commissioned sales force person to be there all the time. They can go off and cover additional surgeons and go cover additional hospitals. So over time, with the adoption of robotics, if it grows in the trend line that we expect, you would assume that the average cost of people that are in the field will go down over time. It doesn't mean we are paying our reps less. Our reps will still be paid as high powered reps that are gaining business, but the actual people who are technically there to help manage the case are paid at a much lower rate. And today there is one price model. The rep, whether it's a rep servicing an accounts or whether they are selling, they are paid the same today. With robotics, we are going to enable a bit of a bifurcation of the model to case coverage people who are technicians, who are paid at a lower rate and sales force who are paid for selling at a higher rate.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Partners", "And does that lead to a bifurcation of the implant from the service cost eventually in your view?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, as I said before, you are going to have two different kinds of people. You are going to have this commission sales force for selling and paid at a high price and the technicians who are a lower price, but there be less need if we gain tremendous volume, there will be less need for high-priced commission reps to just service accounts. They will be out selling. So I really believe that will give us better productivity with our commercial resources.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. As you know it took a little longer this call and really part of the reason for that was to provide extra color on the acquisitions. We have been very busy on the acquisition front and we plan to provide additional perspectives on acquisitions every quarter. So thank you all for joining the call. Our conference call for the third quarter of 2014 results will be held on October 16. Thank you", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Please proceed.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Thank you, Keisha. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's third quarter 2011 earnings report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "Before passing the call over to Katherine and Curt to provide more specifics, we know there have been some investor concerns that we'd like to address, including the slowdown in elective procedures, capital budgets and gross margin. ", "First, with respect to elective procedures. The Recon market continued the softness that began last year in the second quarter. While we look forward to the day the market picks back up, we feel good about our Recon portfolio and our ability to deliver even in a slower environment.", "Second, turning to capital budgets and the potential impact of Medicare spending. We believe there has been an understandable but misplaced overreaction. While the current economic environment remains challenged, hospitals do have access to credit, a clear difference versus the 2008-2009 downturn. Our own third quarter MedSurg results, especially our Medical business, are evidence that these markets remain solid.", "It's also important to note that since late 2008, we have significantly changed the composition of our MedSurg businesses, including expanding our disposables product offering with the Ascent, SONOPET, and Gaymar acquisitions. Our MedSurg businesses are better positioned now than at any point in our history to drive share gains, engage with hospital customers, leverage new product offerings and expand geographically, a fact that we believe will remain clearly the case in the fourth quarter in 2012 and beyond.", "On the gross margin front, we have been negatively impacted in 2011 by a greater-than-expected degree from swings in foreign exchange rates. Although these same swings inflated our gross margin in Q2 and Q3 of 2010, the reverse has been true this year. Beyond FX, we are making the necessary investments to help unlock decentralized inefficiencies that represent a clear long-term leverage opportunity.  ", "With Lonny Carpenter now overseeing global manufacturing since the start of this year, we are investing in various aspects of this multiyear initiative, including our IT infrastructure procurement, vendor consolidation and numerous other aspects, all also absorbing the various acquisitions.", "Ironically, it's the strength of our P&L that's enabling us to make these investments that will yield dividends longer term while not deviating from the earnings targets we've provided at the start of the year. Looked at somewhat more succinctly, our underlying P&L performance is enabling us to manage through some unexpected pressures as well as M&A costs that often result in companies trimming guidance. You're not one of them.", "It's also worth highlighting the fact that over the past 24 months, we have bolstered our core franchises by leveraging the tremendous strength afforded by our solid cash flow and strong balance sheet via acquisitions. We have entered into key adjacent markets that are on track to help accelerate our organic growth in 2012 and beyond. ", "With 10 acquisitions completed in the past 2 years and 4 in 2011 alone, we are committed to further broadening our sales footprint with M&A targets. And it's important to note that we are not just buying one-off growth.", "Every one of these acquisitions is a platform that we fully expect to grow above the rate of our core markets or the foreseeable future. Our sales mix is also strengthened considerably within our MedSurg businesses, particularly through Stryker Sustainability Solutions and more recently Gaymar. These moves have provided our sales team with a stronger product offering and a greater ability to gain market share despite some ongoing challenges in underlying elective procedure growth. We also remain highly focused on ensuring we are investing in internally driven innovation as evidenced by the 23% increase in R&D in the quarter and year-to-date, on top of a 17% increase in 2010.", "Investments in R&D are balanced throughout our portfolio of businesses and include the necessary incremental innovation that's driving our ongoing market share gains in many of our businesses, while also making longer term investments in both product, procedural and service offerings.", "This level of R&D is a clear reflection of our confidence and the opportunities we still see for innovation in our markets. Our commitment to a three-pronged strategy relates to cash deployment is reflected in our Q3 results as we further leveraged our P&L via buybacks that totaled $289 million in the quarter, and our quarterly dividend represented a 20% increase year-over-year. We believe this balanced approach will drive maximum shareholder return, both the short and long term as we look to accelerate organic growth while also driving greater P&L leverage.", "Overall, looking back on our Q3 results and our financial performance to date in 2011, we are pleased with the unique strength of our company, both our products and our people. Although the global economic environment has proven to be more challenging than anticipated at the start of the year, it's clear that our unique business model is enabling us to navigate the challenges while further building on our strengths. Expansion of our sales footprint through our focused M&A activity will be an important driver of our revenue and earnings growth long term. ", "Near term, our strength is allowing us to modestly raise our EPS target for the year, while simultaneously absorbing a series of key strategic acquisitions and making meaningful investments in R&D.", "We believe this combination of funding our innovation pipeline, augmenting our business with higher -- with additional higher-growth franchises and achieving consistent double-digit earnings growth will ensure we are able to maximize shareholder returns in both the near and long term. ", "Net -- although there are always challenges and there will inevitably be things we don't like in any given quarter, we feel good about our ability to deliver and see lots of opportunity for growth in all of our businesses.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Steve. In light of the relatively high level of M&A activity that's occurred with us in recent quarters, my comments today will focus on some additional granularity around these transactions. As many of you on today's call are aware, our cash deployment strategy has focused on acquisitions along with buybacks and dividends. Our cash flow capabilities, we believe that the ability to execute on all 3 is an important competitive advantage that positions us well to deliver on both our short- and long-term financial targets.", "From a scorecard perspective, we are pleased with the performance to date of the various acquisitions. Although retrospectively, the 510(k) clearance of our shape-fitting technology obtained by the OtisMed acquisition took longer than anticipated, early read on the rollout is positive and we view the product as the key offering in our Recon sales force's portfolio. ", "We are also pleased by the reacceleration in Stryker Sustainability Solutions, which delivered strong double-digit top line growth in the quarter. ", "We completed a number of deals focused on our core markets in 2010, including SONOPET, Gaymar and MEDPOR, all of which are tracking at or ahead of our expectations. Although clearly still early, we're excited about the opportunity for us to leverage our considerable sales and distribution capabilities by adding the terrific product portfolios provided by both Orthovita and Memometal. ", "Overall, we look for the totality of our M&A activity to help us to generate solid top line growth despite the softer-than-expected orthopedic implant markets.", "Turning to the most significant acquisition we have completed recently. Neurovascular continues to execute on the launch of its new products, including the next generation coil and detachment system. We view the long-term growth potential in the treatment of stroke that represent one of the most exciting segments within medical technology, reflecting both the tremendous unmet need and opportunities for device space innovation. This was a key factor behind our move to further expand our market-leading presence in the interventional stroke market with the recent acquisition of Concentric Medical, which allows us access to the ischemic stroke segment. ", "Although today, the vast majority, nearly 90%, of neurovascular stroke sales are from devices to treat hemorrhagic stroke, this population represents just 13% of stroke patients. Over 80% of 85% of stroke incidents are from ischemic, and we're excited about the opportunity to leverage our core platform in neurovascular via the addition of Concentric, with its long history of device-based innovation and a truly exciting product pipeline. It's a latest generation stent retriever device designed specifically for the removal of ischemic stroke, is CE approved. And Concentric is currently one of just 2 companies with an FDA-approved IDE trial underway in the stent retriever category. We are targeting a late 2012, 2013 510(k) clearance and believe this technology will represent an important long-term growth driver for our Neurotechnology franchise.", "In sum, a recent series of M&A transactions reflect our stated strategy of both leveraging our core in order to drive sales and cost synergies while also entering key adjacent markets that can help improve our long-term organic growth rates.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. I'll start by saying we again delivered solid financial results based on the inherent strength of our evolving business mix, financial discipline in a diverse and expanding base of recurring revenue, all of which positions us well in today's challenging global economy and changing medtech landscape. ", "Overall, in the third quarter company sales increased 14.9% on a reported basis, 11.7% in constant currency, in line with the second quarter. Essentially, core growth excluding currency and acquisitions slowed in the quarter but was consistent with levels achieved in Q1, pushing it at 4.1%. ", "Despite the lack of any meaningful recovery in elective procedures, we are encouraged by our ability to sustain mid-single digit organic growth, which we are augmenting through our strategic business development activities. Drivers of growth in the quarter included solid MedSurg results, reflecting both continued strength in our medical, instrument segments and an acceleration in our Sustainability Solutions business. Additionally, we saw continued incremental quarter-over-quarter gains in our core Reconstructive business.  Although majority of our Neurotechnology and Spine franchises achieved solid growth, this was offset by sequential slowdown in our spinal implants. ", "Looking at earnings, we delivered encouraging results with adjusted diluted EPS before nonrecurring charges of $0.91, representing growth of 13.8% over Q3 of 2010. On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.84, a decrease of 1.2% versus Q3 of 2010.", "Overall, our 2011 acquisitions as well as those completed in recent years are performing as or better than expected and our integration efforts remain on track. The P&L continues to reflect our investment in systems to support acquisition integration, R&D expansion and the tax benefit driven from our focus on optimizing our operational footprint. Other factors in the quarter include the now typical movement associated with currency on a per share gain of over $0.01, associated with share repurchases and a favorable tax election. Finally, in the quarter, we generated $446 million of cash from operations.", "Reviewing the quarter, I'll start with the discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the third quarter, revenue growth was driven by volume mix, which contributed 6.1% to our top line growth. Company-wide selling prices declined 2%. Overall, pricing remained consistent and in line with recent quarters. Acquisitions added 7.6%. Currency contributed approximately $57 million and improved the company's overall reported sales growth by 3.2%. ", "Looking at our external reporting segments. Reconstructive products, which represented 44% of our sales in the quarter and include our Hip, Knee, Trauma and other reconstructive lines, recorded an 8% increase as reported and a 4% increase on a constant currency basis. The acquisition added 1.7% to the constant currency increase.", "This represents another sequential improvement in our Reconstructive segment, while acknowledging that gains have been marginal and the market remains challenging. ", "At the segment level, hip sales continue to perform well according to 10% reported gain and a 5% increase in constant currency. International markets accelerated in the quarter, delivering our best hip results since Q1 of 2009. Emerging markets and Japan pace the gains . In the U.S., market hip sales continue to benefit from our MDM offering and recorded 5% growth. ", "Conversely, new sales remained weak in the quarter with reported growth of 3% and down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis. International markets recorded 2% constant currency growth, mid-single to low double-digit gains in other international markets, offset by softness in Europe. U.S. market remains difficult as evidenced by the 2% decline in the quarter. However, the commercial launch of our ShapeMatching offering is going well, and we expect it to contribute to modest sequential improvement in the quarters ahead, resulting in tougher fourth quarter comparisons. ", "Globally, Trauma posted 17% reported growth, 12% constant currency growth. Acquisitions added 6% to the top line. Domestic Trauma results recorded a 20% gain, while in international markets, Trauma recorded 5% growth on a constant currency basis.", "Overall, we feel good about our Reconstructive results in a challenged market. We remain optimistic regarding our hip lineup, the OtisMed ShapeMatching solution, MMI acquisition and its influence on our broader trauma offering.", "Next, I'll turn to MedSurg, which represented 38% of sales in the quarter and is comprised of our instruments, endoscopy, medical and Stryker Sustainability Solutions segments. MedSurg has delivered another solid sales quarter, increasing 12% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis, with acquisitions adding 2.2%. Once again, the medical segment was the star of the show delivering 31% reported growth, 20% excluding acquisitions and currency. ", "From a market perspective, the bed and stretcher offering continues to perform well in a market fueled by the replacement and upgrade cycle as well as hospitals' increasing focus and the ability of certain capital purchases to improve efficiencies and facilitate better patient outcomes. Finally, our Sustainability Solutions business returned to mid-, high-teens growth, and this remains our expectation given all the opportunity we first identified in this market over 2 years ago.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represented 18% of the company's sales in the quarter increased 46% as reported and 43% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added 42.5% to the constant currency increase. ", "Highlights in the quarter include strong organic growth from our Interventional Spine and NSE offerings as well as a positive influence of the MEDPOR in neurovascular acquisitions. Obviously, continued pressure on the spinal implant market in terms of both volumes and price influenced core growth in the quarter.  Finally, on a positive note, our Spine business did begin its initial launch with lateral access fusion system. ", "I'll now turn to the income statement, beginning with gross margin performance. Gross margins finished at 67.1% as a result of acquisition charges totaling approximately $18 million. Excluding these charges, gross margins were 68.0% in the quarter, which was lower than the prior year by 140 basis points, which represented a 20 basis point improvement over Q2. Also recall, 2010 third quarter gross margins were favorably impacted by currency. ", "These comments aside, given our management and operational structure, our efforts remain focused on reducing our material and conversion costs in support of our long-term growth strategy, which we believe will drive operating margin expansion despite the potential for greater pricing pressure as the healthcare environment continues to evolve.", "Research and development continued as an area of investment priority, moving to 6% of sales, an increase of 23% versus the third quarter of 2010. In the first 3 quarters, R&D spend is up 23%, influenced by our commitments to increased innovation and the dollars now in the R&D category associated with acquisitions. Stated more succinctly, we believe innovation still matters as a catalyst of long-term growth and we're excited about the current and future flow of new products across our various divisions.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 37.7% of sales. Adjusting for acquisition and integration-related charges, SG&A finished at 36.6% of sales, a decline of 120 basis points versus prior year. Intangible amortization in the quarter was $31 million and represented 1.5% of sales versus the $14 million and 80 basis point of sales in the prior year quarter. Year-to-date, intangible amortization is $90 million and 1.5% of sales versus $42 million, 80 basis points of sales in 2010.  Clearly, the acquisition influence on this line is deleveraging our P&L and the EBIT margin this year. But we expect to see benefit here in the years ahead.", "Reported operating income decreased 5.7% over prior year and moved to 21.9% of sales, reflecting the impact of the inventory step-up in other acquisition and integration-related charges. Adjusted operating income increased 8%, while the adjusted operating margin decreased 150 basis points versus the prior year to 23.8% of sales.", "Other income and expense decreased pretax income by $13 million in the quarter. Components of this included investment income of $9 million, offset by $21 million of interest expense. The company's effective income tax rate was 24.1% for the third quarter. Excluding the tax benefit associated with acquisition-related charges, our effective income tax rate would have been 25% for the quarter. For the year-to-date, our tax rate excluding the acquisition-related charges, is 25.6%, and we are comfortable with this for the year.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.2 billion of cash and marketable securities, $500 million from the $2.7 billion at the end of the second quarter. We supplemented this balance on September 12 with a $750 million 5-year 2% coupon debt offering and offset the increase with working capital expansion, acquisitions and share repurchases. As a reminder, we now have $1.75 billion of debt on the balance sheet, associated with our January 2010 $1 billion debt offering and our September 2011 $750 million debt offering.", "On the asset management side. Accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 58, which represented a decrease of 1 day compared to the prior quarter and prior year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 176, which was an increase of 12 days sequentially versus the second quarter and 2 days against prior year level.", "Turning to cash. In the third quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $446 million and free cash flow of $389 million. Finally, in the quarter, market volatility created a buy-in opportunity. We repurchased 5.9 million shares totaling $289 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 9.9 million shares for a total spend of $539 million. We currently have open authorizations totaling approximately $286 million.", "In summary, we delivered a positive third quarter and in general are on track with our annual earnings goal. The objectives remain driving core business growth, continued acquisition integration, operational focus and a sharpened focus on cash generation.", "Turning to our outlook. Our guidance, as Steve noted, has been adjusted in a couple of areas. Starting with currency. If rates hold in their current levels, we would expect fourth quarter sales to be favorably impacted by approximately 0% to 1% when compared to 2010. Using current rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales will be an increase in the range of 2% to 3% when compared to 2010.", "From a revenue standpoint, we are now calling for a net sales increase of 11% to 12% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as acquisitions, our sales growth is now projected to be 4% to 5% for the full year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share range has been raised and is now anticipated to be in the $3.70 to $3.74 range, representing an increase of 11% to 12% for 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share and comparing favorably to our prior $3.65 to $3.73 target.  We anticipate acquisition and integration-related charges to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.33 to $0.35. ", "Overall, we think the year is largely in line with our expectations. With our continued actions to both leverage and further diversify our revenue base coupled with our ongoing investment in quality, significant uptick in R&D investment and more recently our efforts around operational simplification and alignment, we are highly encouraged regarding our near- and long-term top and bottom line growth prospects. Additionally, we've been supporting these efforts with disciplined capital deployment through share buybacks, dividend expansion and strategic acquisitions. We believe we are well positioned to maximize shareholder returns, with a highly focused and balanced approach. ", "With that, we'll now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Steve, maybe as a starting point, would like to focus on MedSurg. And given the concerns out there, I'd be interested in your comments in which you made earlier about the health of the various end markets. I'm thinking geographically, I'm thinking Europe and the U.S. as you look at the fourth quarter. And then the second part I'd like you to comment on is where you are in the product cycle for your various businesses. I think our understanding is that you have a new product cycle coming on the endoscopy side of the business in cameras in 2012. So any additional insights there will be appreciated.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Sure, Mike. I think we do continue to feel very good about our MedSurg businesses, both in the U.S. and particularly outside of the U.S. I will tell you, Europe was a little rougher in the third quarter, and that was probably our little spot of weakness for our MedSurg businesses in the third quarter. We think that's just a little bit of a market issue, nothing that's had us too concerned. And the bigger issue probably is our product cycle, particularly as it does relate to both endo and to some degree our instruments businesses. But we've got some very good things coming and particularly on the endo side, as you said, things in the pipeline there that we may be a little softer here in the next quarter or so. I'm feeling very good about what's in the lineup. And I would say probably feeling really good about what we have coming in 2012 across all 3 of the big MedSurg franchises.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And the visibility on that for the street, would that have to wait for AAOS?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes, in terms of...", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "In the pipeline.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "It probably  depends [ph] on the product.", "Katherine A. Owen", "It's probably as we get in -- Mike, as you know, historically, we haven't gone into a whole lot of specificity around exact timing of those launches both for competitive reasons as well as sales force focus. So these are 2012 rollouts. The exact timing, probably not going to be too specific on right now.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Steve, just to think strategically, we've seen medical device at markets become increasingly challenged this year or the last few years, and so it's hard to find end markets that are at this point, at least showing meaningful growth. With that reality, how do we think about your further appetite for M&A given how aggressive you've been over the last 24, 36 months?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Sure. I think what we've clearly tried to do, Mike, as you know is find additional growth opportunities within any overall market that you've got packets of strength and things like extremities, things like orthobiologics, things like surfaces in our medical business or SONOPET, which was great for our NSE, our Neurospine franchise. And I think we've been very active and opportunistic in what's going on there. So that really the way we look at it is those markets should grow faster than the overall markets. And continue to look for those -- dare we call it niches or smaller pieces and then look at the big things like the neurovascular that we feel we'll have a very good growth profile. Going forward, would you expect the same pace of acquisition? I'd tell you truthfully, we're probably largely focusing right now on integrating what we've taken. We've taken a lot on over the last 12 to 18 months. And I think you would probably see a slowdown. We're not going to be serial acquirers, but we are going to take advantage when the opportunities pop up. Katherine, I don't know if you want to add to that.", "Katherine A. Owen", "No. I think as BD engine flows, and right now we want to make sure that we leverage the opportunity we've had and not muck it up on the integration side. So it's not an on and off switch, but probably one right now, little bit more focused on innovation and execution.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes. Mike, to have one other comment to that, I think as a CEO, you have to be careful that you're paying attention to truly the organizational abilities to digest so many things. And we're probably, I don't want to say maxed out, but we're stretched and I think love what we've done, but would want to be careful not to take so much more on at this point.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Steve or Curt, just thinking about the quarter, margins came in actually better than we thought and actually sort of revenue in many respects. So just thinking about the fourth quarter change to the top line constant currency number, can you just talk about some of the factors in the fourth quarter that are resulting in incremental pressure? Is it orthopedics? Is it the international market?", "Curt R. Hartman", "David, the second part of your question was the fourth quarter change. Our outlook was the full year.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Agreed. So I'm just assuming, given this third quarter performance is actually in line, a little better than we were looking for, I'm just wondering what the specific slowdowns would be in the fourth quarter.", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think our overall full year guidance -- I can't overlay my guidance on your model, but I think our overall guidance is a statement of not seeing any meaningful recovery in the Reconstructive business, but we are personally, incrementally making gains as you look at our Reconstructive business, Hips, Knees, Trauma. That core business has improved each at the past 3 quarters, albeit very incrementally by our historical standards. But certainly that market has not recovered in a way that I think a lot of people would have assumed as we entered this year. And I don't think in the large European, broad European market we've seen any meaningful recovery as well. So those are probably the 2, #1 ,#2 areas that are driving a little bit of core business pullback and overall outlook pullback.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. And then Steve, you made some comments, and I appreciate Katherine's comments, giving us more detail about many of the acquisitions and the growth platform going forward. You talked about beginning to see the evidence of acceleration in the core business in the '12 and '13 timeframe. As you think about sort of mid-single digit organic constant currency guidance for this year, is it too early to think about acceleration from those levels heading into '12?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I think, David, we want to stay away from getting too far in the guidance for 2012. But I think that you should expect that -- and we feel good about the way we've been reshaping the portfolio this year. But the big question really is going to be do the markets come back much or not? But I think we're trying to position ourselves to have solid organic growth despite -- even if the markets continue right where they are. And we'll, obviously, come back with more specific guidance in January.  All right. Sorry, I can't give you more at that point -- at this point.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So 2 things I wanted to cover. One, I was wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the endo business because that seems to be the one within MedSurg that declined in terms of its growth rate the most from the trends you've seen over the last few quarters. So if you could talk about that a little bit. And then I wanted to ask a question on operating margins, but I'll save that for the follow-up.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes. On endo, I think it's really product life cycle related. And I would tell you Katherine, Curt and I were actually out for that business last week and feel really good about where they'll be headed next year.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Steve, did I hear you correctly when you said you should expect incremental softness in the fourth quarter?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "No.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the operating margin side, either Steve or Curt, this year we've seen declines in operating margin. We obviously all understand the R&D piece. But in terms of gross margin and SG&A, can you just talk from a top, down perspective about the pressures on those business, or on those line items this year? And as we look forward and then again, I'm not asking for 2012 guidance, but can we get -- at what point can those turn and what allows it to turn the operating margin back up again?", "Curt R. Hartman", "It's obviously a hot topic here in the last couple of quarters, Bob, specifically, as it relates to gross margins. Clearly, currency movement does impact gross margins. But I think in addition to that, when we look at our business, we really start with what's the revenue outlook and what's the earnings target that we're going for. And all the levers in between those 2 are at our discretion to use, to run our business in a way that we think will best help us in the given quarter, the given year, also as we look to the future and where we think the business needs to be. So as you look at gross margins specifically, there's clearly been currency influence there this year. And in addition, and Steve mentioned this in his opening comments, we now have a global executive who is focused on our global operations. Any time you do that, any time you align an operations team, a lot of projects come forward. Those projects all come with a price and you have to make those investments before you see the return. In addition, the M&A that's been discussed also brings cost that hit gross margin. Not all of those cost get called out as acquisition and integration-related charges because some of those costs are investments that we'll use across the company for further leverage in the out-year, specifically as it relates to SG&A. I honestly feel decent about where SG&A is right now. We've had some ups and downs over the last 3 quarters. But in general, I feel pretty good about what we're doing there. I think everybody in the med device base is looking at distribution-related cost and trying to figure out where those are going to move, over what period of time, and that includes Stryker. But in general  I think we've got the right approach and the right focus on those right now.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "If I could just add one other thing. I think we clarified when we did Boston Neurovascular acquisition. What we're doing is there absorbing a division from a company that was structured very differently than ours. And again, one of the things we've had to do this year is invest in some of the back-office support areas as well to absorb that acquisition and let them focus on what they do well, which is drive the top line, drive the innovation. So there has been additional cost in the SG&A line supporting that this year that we should start to see leverage in the future as well.", "Curt R. Hartman", "And just from a metric standpoint, year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is identical to what it was a year ago. So that my comment about I think we're doing okay, given everything we put in through the P&L this year to be equal to where we were as a ratio, 37.3% of sales actually feel okay, and think about that in the future periods how we can leverage that as we expand the sales base.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart", "Just wanted to go over, I guess, the reduction in underlying sales growth. Curt, I think you'd said the new guidance assumes 4% to 5%. I think the old guidance was 5% to 7%. Just want to kind of clarify that.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes. We started the year with core business growth of 5% to 7%. We're moving that to 4% to 5%, and I would just tell you it's a reflection of where we are in the year through the first 3 quarters and the size of core growth we have to deliver in the fourth quarter to stay within our 5% to 7% range. Number one, it doesn't feel realistic after 3 quarters being under our belt. Number two, we think the 4% to 5% is a realistic reflection that some of the core markets i.e., reconstructive, have not returned to a level that we had originally assumed as we started this year. We're as optimistic as anyone and we want to continue to drive our teams to higher growth levels. I think the 4% to 5% more accurately reflects the first 3 quarters and where we see the year finishing up.", "Kristen M. Stewart", "Okay. And then I guess just kind of the changes mostly you would say is attributable to the slower performance within Recon, mainly Hip and Knee?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes, and Spine. Spine is recorded in our Neurotech and Spine segment. And as I mentioned in my comments, we did not have a good spinal implant quarter. It was, frankly, disappointing. And I think it just reflects the broad pressure in the overall reconstructive market, even though, we report those in a different segment than our Reconstructive business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "You talked about the slightly better performance in Hips and sort of acceleration in the second quarter in the U.S. Is this -- the new product you've launched? Is that the primary driver? And should we expect a continued gradual step-up as you've talked about the freight train image in the past? Should we expect that gradual increase going forward despite the tough market?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes, I think the freight train analogy is a very good one, Rick. We're seeing MDM take off. I would just remind you, we're going against a tough fourth quarter comp. But overall, the trend here is looking up. And I think we're feeling -- we're hearing very good stuff out of the field and out of the surgeon community on MDM. I think we're in the right place at the right time with that product.", "Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "So it's all about the new products?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes.", "Frederick A. Wise - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Ascent, Kathy, if I heard you correctly, did I hear you say strong double-digit growth? Or I think it's your exact language, if I understood you correctly. J&J has now bought SterilMed. Maybe, Steve or Katherine, you could talk about the dynamics of that business. And is this going to be a more important growth driver, small still, but going forward as we're processing gains, more traction?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes. Rick, to clarify, we did have double-digit growth. It was a clear step-up in the quarter, business bouncing back very nicely, and we feel we've got that back on track, continue to feel great about the fundamentals. And frankly, we think J&J's entry into it is going to, a, further validate this is a market. To an enormous degree, I think it's wonderful when you have Stryker and J&J both as now the #1 and 2 players in the market. And I think the underlying fundamentals and healthcare cost and everything else we continue to feel really good about having identified this one a couple of years ago and picked up the market leader with big growth potential in a market that's probably going to become more validated now than ever.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Wanted to follow up on an earlier question on strategic interest. I know you had taken on a lot recently in your organizations, integrating those acquisitions. But one of the questions on the call earlier today raised a question in my mind about your business. You're pretty much fully exposed across your business lines and sort of government and private pay reimbursed products, maybe with the exception of hospital equipment. And I'm wondering if you've contemplated, if you would contemplate diversifying that, especially given the regulatory and payer environment that we're in to include something that's a little bit more patient pay, commercial pay, self-pay-oriented. And then I have one follow-up.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Matt, I wouldn't say that, that's got to be a strategic driver. We do talk about that a lot, and I would tell you we have looked at some markets that are more exposed to a bigger private paying component. But we feel good still about the markets we're in. And I think over time, ultimately, we would also believe there may become more of a private pay component even to some of the businesses that we're in and ultimately where innovation will continue to drive the business. We think about it, but wouldn't expect a big move. We're pretty good sticking close to our core, as you know.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then the follow-up was on Recon and some of your launches there. Even though you're not calling here for a recovery in orthopedics or reconstructive, it does -- halfway through the reporting cycle, it does seem like you're coming up kind of in the top quartiles of performance this quarter. And I'm wondering , with respect...", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "As we should.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Pardon?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "As we should.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "As you should, that's what I like to see. But in these new product launches, just to set the right expectation, used to be that it would take a good solid couple of years to be into the meat of a new rollout. Given the environment -- I guess what we're hearing is maybe even those timelines had become more a little bit stretched out in the way that you deploy instruments, the way that you train and roll these things out, just maybe because of the market's capacity to absorb new products has changed. Any color on that? Is that something -- should we think about these products that way?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Matt, I think you have to -- it's going to be difficult to make a blanket statement. So if you look traditionally in Hips and Knees, those are typically longer, couple years as you fully rollout. And not just the instruments but you train the sales force, train the surgeons. But if you take, for instance, right now MDM, which is our key Hip product launch. It really benefited from a lot of the heavy lifting that went on around both the philosophy and the instrumentation, et cetera, from ADM. So that's probably had a little bit better of initial uptake than you'd see with a traditional Recon product. And also OtisMed, there was familiarity with that shape-fitting technology as it was on the market a few years ago. And there's general familiarity with it. So I don't think you can make a blanket statement. It's going to depend on the type of product and the type of launch, but I wouldn't say from a macro-environment we're seeing stretched-out product uptakes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Collins Stewart.", "Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division", "I had a question on the 1% to 2%, your change in sort of the core growth, is that something that you kind of realized throughout the quarter, you looked into Q4? Or it's been a little bit light throughout the year and there's been some sort of expectation that things would get better and now you kind of just need to readjust expectations?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I'd consider the borderline adjustment at the end of the day when you look at it, 4% to 5% versus the low end of 5%. We're seeing how the year is playing out, clearly the markets have not materialized, but it's a very modest incremental adjustment.", "Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division", "What I'm trying to, I guess, figure out is that are things appearing worse than they had in the Hip and Knee market? Or they're just not getting as good?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "It's really seeing where things shook out in the third quarter. And being this close to the end of the year, we've got, obviously, more data at this point, and just recognizing the comps for the fourth quarter and product life cycles and everything else. So do not read it at all as a signal that we're concerned about where we're headed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dave Turkaly with SIG.", "David Turkaly - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "I know you mentioned the pricing was down 2% in the quarter. And just curious, as you updated the guidance, how is that relative to your expectations? And is that kind of what we should be expecting us we look forward for the company ahead?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Pricing this year has been in the 1% to 2% down range. So it somewhat fits right in with where pricing trends have been in the last couple of quarters. And I think we're comfortable saying that it will remain in that category, that range as we look forward. I think it's kind of the same old, same old.", "David Turkaly - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division", "Okay. And then I know you mentioned OtisMed and having to customize the product coming. Can you tell us what you think with the size of that market is or what the opportunity might be for you? How big that is as a percent of kind of the overall knee market? So what kind of opportunity you have ahead as you launch that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. It's tough to get really firm data on penetration rate. Some of the numbers hover around 10% of knee procedures using customized shape fitting. But we obviously think there's opportunity for further inroads. And longer term, some of that may be required to have clinical data that really demonstrate some of the benefits that we believe exists as it relates to higher throughput, et cetera. So no specific target we would put out there, but clearly, we think it's going to be an important part of the sales forces' arsenal of offerings in the  knee side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "Topher Orr - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "This is actually Topher Orr in for David. Just a follow-up on some earlier questions. I was looking at acquisitions over the past year, and I was hoping you could just give us an update on which of those acquisitions have kind of the biggest overhang on gross margins currently? And over the next few quarters, how you see further integration of these acquisitions kind of shaking out from a gross perspective?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I don't know if we're going to go acquisition by acquisition here and evaluate gross margins. But I think the key focus here on all the acquisitions is executing well defined integration plan. And as we said in our commentary, we feel good about acquisition integration plans as it relates to most recently Orthovita, Memometal, Neurovascular business at the beginning of the year, and going back into last year the acquisitions that we completed then. We feel good about our integration plans, don't want to overburden the organization with additional integration. So that's a key focus is a focus on the integration, so we don't run into problems and then do image to the revenue outlook, which is really where you bring the P&L pressure. So I think being focused on integrating. Doing it right and doing it in a comprehensive fashion is where our focus is.", "Topher Orr - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Another for Neurovascular specifically, could you provide an update on where you guys stand now and maybe not gross margin specifically, but just kind of overall where you see the timelines for that?", "Curt R. Hartman", "As Steve said, it's a complicated integration because you're going from a culture that was highly centralized in terms of the back-office support. With company and Stryker that's a little more decentralized in some of the back-office support. It's got 3 facilities that have to be brought over from Boston Scientific to Stryker, and I think we originally stated this would be a 2- to 2.5-year acquisition integration, and we're pretty much right on track with that. Now, obviously as we go country by country, there's different regulatory approval pathways. Some of those are online, some of those stretch out. Those don't materially impact selling revenue. What they do impact is employees who are waking up every day saying; \"At some point, I'd become a Stryker employee.\" And so we're very sensitive to that. The business, we feel very good about the business. The Target Coil, a detachment system rolled out early in the year. We've effectively got a global launch at this point. We recently introduced that to the Japanese market, which was really our final core market there. So I think we feel really good about the team at NV and what they're doing on a global basis and now they're both playing out and winning in the commercial market while dealing with challenges that are inherent with every integration.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities USA.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I have a question just regarding the ischemic stroke market and the Concentric Medical acquisition. I understand that they're studying their new Trevo product. But I'm just wondering what's really kind of held that market back because their sales so far have been somewhat disappointing.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I guess a couple of comments. So a big part of the rationale behind that acquisition was their excitement around the ischemic market. The use of device-based innovation for ischemic is in the very, very early stages. And so they have launched in some markets outside the U.S. But candidly part of the rationale for becoming part of Stryker is to have the considerable benefit we bring from sales and distribution capabilities that they were not able to tap into just given their size. And we're really excited about the pipeline there and the potential we see and the early adoption, quite frankly.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just one question on the share count. I'm sorry if you've already given this, but given the buyback, what share count should we be modeling for the fourth quarter and the full year?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Let me get back to you on that one. I don't have that right in front of me.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Starting with a higher-level strategic question. The markets are clearly slowing, you're facing an environment of increasing cost pressures. Some of it may be cyclical, but I think no one would argue that a good portion of it is secular in nature. Given that context, have you thought about -- or what are the opportunities to further reduce your cost structure and in particular I'm thinking about your selling cost by perhaps altering your selling model here in the U.S. to something more similar to that in -- like what you're doing in Europe? Is that possible at all? Or is that just kind of out of the realm of possibility for this point in time?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "You should assume we are constantly looking at all kinds of options, and we operate with different models within our company. Our MedSurg businesses are different than the orthopedic implant businesses, and they give us some different avenues to call upon. And I think it actually creates a competitive strength for us to think about some different models. We've got some lower gross margin businesses with lower SG&A, but still deliver very good operating margins and we kind of know how to play different ways, and you should be assured we're thinking along those lines as we head forward.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess turning to your international markets, it sounded like what's kind of keeping some of that growth going right now is your Asian sales and your emerging markets there, and you're seeing the continued weakness in Europe. I guess could you kind of split each of those 2 apart and how much of the emerging markets benefit that you're seeing or the Asian markets benefit that you're seeing, how much of that is transient versus sustainable? And then if you can give us a little bit more detail on how bad is Europe really? Is it getting worse? And maybe some examples of you what you're seeing there.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I'll take it on a big picture basis. We've got a lot of really good things going on in our international markets, beyond emerging markets. Our Japan business, Australia, Canada, a lot of our businesses are really performing very, very nicely right now. And I'd say as you think about our international business, we got to think about is Europe from both a market standpoint as well as some of our own issues. We can do a little bit better, and that's a clear focal point, and emerging markets from a growth standpoint that we're focused on sustainable growth as we go into those markets. And we've probably been a little more cautious. Again, trying to build for the long term not just going in and grabbing tenders or this or that in certain markets. So we're very much building to the long haul as we always do within this company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vivian Cervantes with Kaufman Bros.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "I wanted to drill down a little bit more on beds and the performance in medical. Understanding the move towards increased efficiencies and the hospitals wanting to invest in that, can you drill down a little bit on what the minutia might be? Is it helping nurses out a little bit? Is it reimbursement-related? Is a quality compliance? Anything that will give us something to bite onto on what increased efficiency means.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Really a combination of all of, Vivian. Certainly some of the -- the way we put some of the software into the beds, there's great opportunity for nurses to operate the things more efficiently, but also the never events. We are helping reduce never events, which from a reimbursement standpoint, as you know, under the new healthcare laws and everything else, the hospitals are a big deal. And there's still a lot of hospitals with very outdated beds and stretchers that we are clearly capitalizing on.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And my last question, heading into North American Spine Society, you do have that new lateral product. Wondering what else we should keep an eye out for, particularly from the orthopedic side with some of the new products, I think, that may have recently introduced or even pipeline products that may be coming out?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I think you want to see it there. But in the meantime, obviously, the lateral in Orthovita a couple of our big things.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Caris.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I actually wanted to tack onto the medical question about bed. Is that specifically new products that you're offering? Or is it the new sales approach where you're basically going in there and doing an economic calculation to take advantage of new reimbursement rules?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "It's primarily product. And I would say the '08, '09 downturn taught us how to probably sell better and sell value. So it's a bit of both, Jason, as well as frankly, Gaymar and selling surfaces along with our frames now. We used to sell the frames without, really, the surface revenue.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And in terms of the Ascent, which is also part of that segment I believe, are you focused on reprocessing your own products? Or have you sort of opened it up for pretty much anything that you can handle?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Remember, Jason, that the time of that acquisition, the vast majority over -- well over 95% of the revenue that they were achieving was from products that had nothing to do with Stryker. So there are some Stryker reprocessed products. And we do think longer term, there's opportunity to leverage our MedSurg offering. But the bulk, the vast majority of what they reprocess is not Stryker.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Charles Chon with Stifel.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "First question is just a follow-up on pricing. So I can appreciate that there are some moving parts as the company plans 2012, and while you wouldn't wanted to provide a glimpse into next year, but the things that we do know, can you verify for me whether the biennial reimbursement cuts in Japan are expected to take effect in 2012?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And now is it coming in the April timeframe?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Usually, yes.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then the second question is I'd like to dig a little more into the performance in Spine. We were expecting a significant contribution from just the Orthovita acquisition. Maybe you could just give us a little bit more color as to what exactly happened during the quarter there?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Well I think the Orthovita acquisition performed as we expected, my comments were more specific. Spine as it relates to Memometal, the implant piece of that business. So I think we feel very good about Orthovita broadly speaking because as we said in our acquisition announcement, that product offering will be sold by multiple parts of Stryker selling organization be it CORTOSS, Vitoss, Vitagel. And we've, in fact, done that and feel very good about the distribution patterns right now across all of those franchises. Because it relates specifically to the Spine business and our hardware franchise, it's a little tougher going in the third quarter than what we had anticipated, and it's probably a combination of both some market dynamics and perhaps some self-induced factors. So disappointed with that growth rate overall. Excited about lateral access fusion product and reenergizing that organization.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Just curious on the Trauma business. It was again pretty strong on an organic basis in the quarter. I know you said last quarter that there was some exuberance around Memometal really driving that performance, are we seeing a carryover of that effect? Or are you seeing some benefit from the proposed, this J&J deal? Just some more granularity on the performance will be helpful.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I think it's actually neither. I think it's just the core blocking and tackling still of our Trauma franchise. That I think that team has been winning really, frankly, for 5 or 6 years now, and continuing to have good momentum there. There is some excitement around the Memometal acquisition and that helped the overall numbers. But the core Trauma business still posted some good growth. And I think the Memometal is a nice, certainly a nice add-on, and we're excited about where that will be going for us. And on the J&J, seeing this thing, I think it's still too early to really tell, and we know they're going to be a formidable force.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then the follow-up question I had. Steve, 6, 7 straight quarters now some pretty accelerated R&D spending, when should we start to see some more of these new product flow out, I don't know if you want to call it bolus, but new product is coming out. But when should we start to see more and more of those products coming in? How would you characterize them? Would you say they're more product iterations. I know there are some M&A additional spend associated with the deals that you've been doing, but would it be more product iterations or additive new products adding to the bag?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "It'll be a bit of both. And I think, obviously, as we commended 2012, you'll see some new things coming. But a lot of that -- we talk a lot about hitting a lot of singles and doubles. We're certainly making some other investments, but it should be the stuff that we've been really good at.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just on gross margin, is 68% about the way we should be thinking about it for the fourth quarter? And then in the past, I think, you've talked about gradually increasing gross margins over time, and I was just wondering if that was contingent on \"normalized\" Recon growth? Or is there an opportunity in near to intermediate term to see gross margin expansion based on mix or perhaps other in this -- excuse me, efficiency initiatives that might be underway?", "Curt R. Hartman", "So the gross margin in the third quarter was 68% adjusting for all the acquisition-related costs. And I think going back to the second quarter at the end of that call or somewhere during that call, we said that we anticipated gross margins to be in the 68% to 68.5% range as it relates to the full year, and I think we're still comfortable with that guidance. As it relates to gross margins longer term -- my commentary in the gross margin discussion was around our operational focus and looking at everything from procurement cost, material cost, manufacturing cost independent of which franchise the product falls into. And really, as a company, this is our first time taking a hard look, broadly speaking, at our manufacturing operations. So that's what gives us confidence that there's a lot of opportunity in the years ahead. Again, keeping in mind, as the business expands, be it in the emerging markets or there's additional cost pressures, which everybody likes to talk about, you may need those gross margin points to offset that. You may want to fuel those gross margin gains into R&D or other areas of investment for the business. So I think our walking around sense is gross margin expansion remains an opportunity in the quarters and years ahead. Keep it in mind, we have areas of investment within manufacturing that do influence gross margin. So I don't want to lock people into this steady stairstep. We're going to manage the business across the entirety of the P&L. We strategically make investments where we believe there are most important at a given point in time.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And if I can follow up on SG&A. It's sort of a similar question, but SG&A margins held flat year-to-date, inclusive of a lot of things going on at the company. Would you expect to see some leverage there going forward, I guess particularly in '12?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think we're very focused, broadly speaking, on financial disciple across the company. And whether that's in SG&A or gross margins, we're taking a hard look at every dollar we spend and how we spend it and whether there's leverage opportunities across multiple parts of the company or a shared services opportunity, things of that nature. So we continue to look and be very diligent, ensuring that we don't disrupt the culture of this company that's made us so great over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman with Oppenheimer.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Two questions. First, is the company taking advantage of your diversity versus some of your peers in terms of getting more hospital business and certainly more -- talk about approaching the C-Suite more broadly? Can you talk about how you guys are getting synergy across your business line? And I have a follow-up.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I'd say we're still at the very early innings to that. I think we've been building the capabilities to do that. But there's still -- a lot of our businesses are still hand-to-hand combat down in the operating rooms. So I think what you should think is we're positioning ourselves for when that day really comes. I think we're well poised to capitalize on that. We're having some discussions with the certain hospital systems on that, but I would call it very early innings.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then on MedSurg, the EU markets obviously soft today and your exposure there in MedSurg is just small, which is good today. But when should we think about the international expansion for MedSurg being a growth driver for Stryker in the coming years?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I think it has been -- really for the last couple of years, our endo and instruments business has been growing pretty nicely outside the U.S., and they continue to win a lot of the market. So I think you should expect those to grow pretty nicely here and probably be growing faster than some of the domestic markets for a good period. There's always going to be some quarterly bounces as you well know on our MedSurg business as well over the years.", "Operator", "And your final question will come from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Curt, just wanted to follow up on maybe Charles' question on the spinal implant side. You described that as maybe some self-induced issues as well as market-driven. Do you feel like that there's a step-up at all in payer pushback issues and some of the commercial payer issues on the self-induced side? Was it product-driven? I know you've lost some sales reps there over the last few quarters, any more color you could provide there?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I don't think we saw a meaningful change in payer pushback. I think that's been tough going back to the fourth quarter of 2009. So there's not a new dynamic there. I think, again, the self-induced challenges are more than right products, the organization waiting for products, and we're getting encouraged by our lateral access to buy skidding out. But self-induced stuff is probably internal execution. And before we wrap up, I do want to get back on the share count question. We finished the quarter at 386 million shares, so I think people from a modeling purpose should use that for the fourth quarter and then again heading into 2012.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then can I ask my follow-up question there? Steve, just for you, on organic growth. I know you don't want to get into 2012 guidance, understandable at this point. But is it fair to think as target in some of this roll-off from being acquisition to then in your organic growth number, even if your end market, especially ortho implants, don't really change at this point. I think I understand that low single-digit growth range. Your natural company-wide organic growth maybe picks up 0.5 to 1 point, maybe even a little more than that next year just based on some of these higher growth areas now layering into the organic side?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I think we will probably hope that, Jeff. And again, we will give that guidance in early January. ", "And to that end, we want to thank everybody for joining us today, and we will report our fourth quarter results and talk about 2012 on January 24.

And welcome to the Second Quarter 2007 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Annie and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. We will be conducting a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator Instructions). As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "Certain statements made in today's conference call may constitute forward-looking statements. They will be based upon management's current expectations and will be subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. In addition to factors that may be discussed in this call. Such factors include, but are not limited to: pricing pressures generally, including cost-containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the Company's products, regulatory actions, unanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and eventual United States Food and Drug Administration approval of new products, changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payers, a significant increase in product liability claims, changes in economic conditions that adversely affect the level of demand for the Company's products, changes in foreign exchange markets, changes in financial markets, and changes in the competitive environment. Additional information concerning these and other factors are contained in the Company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. ", "Today\u2019s conference call will also include a discussion of adjusted net earnings from continuing operations from the comparative quarter and six month period ended June 30th, 2007 and 2006. ", "For the discussion of this non-GAAP financial measure including a GAAP reconciliation appears in the Company\u2019s Form 8-K filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which maybe accessed from the full Investors page on the Company\u2019s website at www.stryker.com. ", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today\u2019s call Mr. Steve MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed, sir. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thank you, Annie and good afternoon everyone and welcome to Stryker's second quarter 2006 earnings report. With me today are Dean Bergy, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. ", "Simply put, we are very pleased with our second quarter results and about our prospects going forward. We emphasized, coming into this year, that we were focused on executional excellence and should also begin to see the results of increased commitment we made to R&D a few years back. We think these results show that we are meeting these goals. ", "Specifically, net sales in the quarter of $1.464 billion were up 16% as reported and up a strong 14.2% operationally; our best growth rate in the last eight quarters. We were particularly encouraged because both our Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg franchises delivered accelerating growth rates over last quarter in both the U.S. and globally. ", "In the U.S., our growth was broad and quite balanced, with Orthopaedic Implants up 17%, MedSurg up 18% and total growth of 17%. ", "Internationally, our operational growth of 9% was up modestly versus last quarter, as accelerations in hips, knees and trauma all led to slightly stronger orthopedic implant growth of 7%, while MedSurg again posted mid-teen growth rates. ", "While Dean will give additional details, I'd like to highlight the particular success of our U.S. spine and trauma businesses, each of which achieved growth rates of 30% or better in the quarter, and drove total sales growth above our expectations. ", "In the case of trauma, this is the second straight quarter at 30% or higher and 6th straight quarter at over 20%. And, while we do not expect these franchises to perform at such high levels on a sustaining basis, we are certainly pleased with the current results. ", "We would also highlight that both our Endoscopy and Instruments franchises grew significantly faster this quarter compared with the last, with Endoscopy up 20% globally and instruments up 18%. While the quarterly numbers for these businesses may bounce around somewhat due to the nature of hospital capital expenditures, we are clearly seeing great customer acceptance of the new 1188 camera and System 6 power tool lines and expect this momentum to continue for a few more quarters. ", "Given our strong performance over time and the lofty expectations placed upon us, a persistent question posed to us is, how can you keep this growth going? And believe me it is constantly front and center on our minds, perhaps even more, when reporting such a strong quarter. To that end, we also took a number of strategic actions during the quarter to ensure continued strong growth in the quarters and years ahead. ", "Among these actions were, one, we divested our non-strategic physiotherapy business, which will clearly have a positive impact on both margins and growth rates going forward. ", "Second, our instruments business made two small product acquisitions in the quarter while sales were minimal in the quarter; we believe these products; a tourniquet system, and level of consciousness monitor, will continue to help our instrument franchise grow at above market rates in the years ahead. ", "Three of our medical businesses, which consist of beds, stretchers and EMS equipment, signed an agreement to enter the rental business. We have also just launched our new in-touch critical care bed. ", "These initiatives should allow our medical business to continue to grow at above market rates. With 15 straight quarters of double-digit growth in a market with single digit growth, we feel good about where we are, where we are headed with this franchise. ", " Fourth, our spine business filed the FlexiCore PMA and also completed an agreement with Regeneration Technologies to distribute spinal allograft implants beginning later this quarter. Combined with healthy new product flow, these efforts should also keep our spine business growing at above market rates. ", "And finally, on July 3rd, we were very pleased to receive clearance from FDA to market the Cormet Hip Resurfacing product in the U.S. We have just initiated the training and education legs for this program and believe it will provide a nice and well needed boost to our hip franchise in the quarters ahead. ", "We have been very focused on executing, not only for today, but also for tomorrow. Each quarter we, invariably, remind ourselves that we are also far from perfect. And one of our obvious disappointments this quarter was in receiving a warning letter from FDA, regarding one of our hip manufacturing facilities in Ireland. It is increasingly clear that FDA is raising its expectations, and we are focused on elevating our abilities as well. ", "I will now turn it over to Dean, for more details. ", "Dean Bergy", "Thanks, Steve. I will begin with the impact of foreign currency and sales. ", "International sales in the second quarter were favorably impacted by $23 million boosting the company's overall sales growth by 1.8%. In the second quarter, the dollar weakened approximately 7% against the Euro and strengthened about 5% against the Yen, compared to the prior year. And if currency rates hold near current levels, we expect the impact of foreign currency will increase third quarter 2007 sales by about 1% to 1.5%, when compared to the prior year. ", "And next I\u2019ll turn to the price volume analysis in the quarter and I will tell you there are just two things making up our 16% total growth: the foreign currency translation impact that I just talked about at 2%, and then the volume mix growth of 14%, which means that price was flat in the quarter. ", "Prices in Japan were negatively impacted by the January 1, 2007 and April 1, 2007 MHLW reimbursement cuts with prices in that geographic market, up by about 5% in the second quarter. Slight increases in various other markets contributed to negate this impact for the company as a whole. ", "The second quarter sales increase was nearby growth in overall volume mix of 14% as I said with the domestic volume mix up 17%, and the international growing at a 9% equal. ", "Now taking a look at sales in our various categories. Orthopaedic Implants sales, which make up 60% of our sales, increased to 15% in the second quarter on a reported basis and 12% of constant currency basis. The sales growth rates by product line are included in our press release and I\u2019ll reference those rates as I provide more detail on performance in the category of these products. ", "So within implants, starting with hips, that category was up 8% in dollars and 6% in local currency in the quarter. Global hip growth was up 2 points on a sequential basis with hips posting their best growth rate in two years. ", "U.S. hips sales grew 6% in the quarter lead by sales of X3 polyethylene inserts and our Accolade cementless hip products. Sales of hip fracture products were about flat in the quarter. ", "European hip sales posted mid single-digit operational growth in the quarter lead by Trident, Exeter and Accolade products. Europe is also getting a bit of traction with the MITCH resurfacing hip. ", "In Japan, Hip sales declined at high single-digit levels in constant currency. MHLW price reduction were responsible for about 5 points of decline. We, again, saw a minus volume growth in sales of our secure fit hip offset by slight declines in bipolar units. ", "Local currency hip sales posted high teen\u2019s growth in the Pacific led by MITCH resurfacing product X3 polyethylene and Accolade. ", "Now turning to knees, they were up 15% in dollars and 13% operationally in the quarter. Knee sales in the United States were again strong registering 16% growth in the second quarter. Primary knee sales grew at mid-teens levels with Triathlon and X3 Polyethylene continuing to lead the way. ", "Provision knee sales bounced back from a softer first quarter to post low double-digit growth led by Scorpio. In Europe, knees grew mid to high single-digits operationally led by extremely strong growth in Triathlon and steady Scorpio sales. ", "In Japan, second quarter knee sales posted a very slight decline in constant currency terms, and prices factored in unit sales of our Scorpio NRG product were above flat with the prior year. Pacific's knee business posted another quarter with operational growth above 20% led by excellent growth in Triathlon and a good quarter in Scorpio. ", "Now turning to trauma that was up 20% in dollars and 18% in constant currency in the quarter. Our U.S. trauma business found the way to tap the exceptional 31% growth rate posted in the first quarter growing 35% in the second, a percentage that is 36% when military sales are excluded. ", "This marks the sixth straight quarter of better than 20% growth in U.S. trauma sales. Domestic trauma sales were strong across all categories led by Gamma3 Hip Fracture devices, T2 Intramedullary Nails and our VariAx Distal Radius product. ", "International pharma sales grew 7% in constant currency in the second quarter. A very solid performance when Japanese price reductions are considered. European local currency trauma sales grew at low double-digit levels. Japanese operational trauma sales declines were held to mid single digits with solid volume growth offsetting a 12% price decrease. ", "Trauma sales and growth in Pacific topped 30% in local currency. Now, turning to spine that was up 26% in dollars and 24% operationally in the quarter, obviously, our spine business had another excellent quarter. ", "In the U.S., sales growth reached 30%. Growth was strong across all categories and was led by XIA thoracolumbar products in the interbody space centers. Constant currency spine sales growth was 13% and international market was strong growth in thoracolumbar and interbody devices. Operational growth was relatively consistent in Europe, Japan and the Pacific, ranging from 12% to 17%. ", "CMF was up 20% in dollars and 18% in local currency in the second quarter. CMF sales also accelerated the United States market reaching 27% growth in the quarter. U.S. growth was again led by neuro products and our hydroset injectable bone substitute. Sales outside the U.S. grew 4% in local currency led by Europe and the Pacific. ", "Now turning to our MedSurg group that represents 40% of our sales. The MedSurg group had an excellent quarter with accelerating growth from instruments and Endoscopy and balanced growth across the domestic and international categories. As a reminder, MedSurg is comprised of three significant product category: instruments comprises 17% of the company sales, Endoscopy 14%, and medical 9% making up that total 40% of company sales. ", "Our MedSurg group sales were 18% for the quarter in U.S. dollars and 17% in constant currency. Domestic growth picked up nicely for instruments and Endoscopy on a sequential basis and the international growth for these product lines continued to be strong. ", "Now, for some categories on the individual categories. Sales of our instruments' product line increased 19% in the second quarter as reported and they were up 18% in constant currency. Our instruments' business had a strong second quarter with consistent performance, both in and outside the United States. U.S sales growth of 18% was lead by extremely strong growth in heavy duty power tools, with System 6 and Precision Blades serving as the catalyst. ", "Sales of other surgical products were also strong in the quarter and sales of Navigation and Interventional Pain products were very solid. International sales of instruments products were particularly strong for Neuro, Spine and ENT products, along with the Navigation and Interventional Pain categories. ", "On a geographic basis, growth map has exceeded 20% operationally in Europe, Pacific, Canada, and Latin America. Our endoscopy business was up 22% in the second quarter as reported and 20% operationally. Endoscopy also delivered a great quarter with solid geographic balance. ", "The U.S. business rebounded to grow 21% in the quarter. Video sales were exceptionally strong, paced by the 1188 HD Camera and accessories. In the Communication and Imaging, Arthroscopy and General Surgery categories, all posted growths somewhere in the mid to high teens range. International sales were particularly strong in Europe and Japan, with our Arthroscopy and General Surgery product categories again leading the way. ", "Then turning to our medical business, they were up 11% in the quarter on both reported and constant currency basis. Medical put up another solid quarter. U.S. sales growth was lead by an excellent quarter from our EMS products, and strong stretcher sales. Net sales were softer, particularly in Critical Care, in advance of the new product launch mentioned by Steve. ", "International sales were extremely strong in Canada but this was offset by softness in other international markets. ", "Now I\u2019ll make some comments on the remainder of the income statement. In most cases I will be discussing amounts from continuing operations which reflect the divestiture of physiotherapy associates, as can be seen in our press-release physiotherapy results of the collapsed discontinued operations in the financial statements. We have also provided supplementary historical operating results as part of the release reflecting the discontinuance of this business. ", "The first place the PT impact is evident is in gross margins, which are now around 69% levels versus 66 to 67% previously. Gross profit margins in the quarter were up 40 basis points on a sequential basis and 80 basis points compared to the prior year. ", "We continue to benefit in the quarter from stronger relative growth and by our higher gross margin U.S. implant business. We have also been running the plants a bit faster than normal as we work toward new product launches leading to higher absorption. ", "We expect this phase will follow us somewhat in the second half for the corresponding hit to margins. For the upcoming third quarter we would also remind you the gross margin percentages generally drop off, as the business mix shifts more heavily to MedSurg during a slower elective surgery season for implant products. This phenomenon didn\u2019t occur in 2006, primarily because we benefited from reduced royalty costs attributable to royalty agreement expirations that we should plan for this year. ", "Now, turning to research and development expenditures. Research and development grew by a healthy 21% in the quarter and reached 6.3% of sales; a pace in line with last year\u2019s annual rate. R&D spending is growing at most of the locations as we continue to develop certain acquired technologies and invest for the future. ", "SG&A cost increased 18% in the quarter, slightly higher than the rate of growth in sales. Sales related cost accounted for the majority of this increase; these costs include compensation and higher instrumentation amortization cost associated with our orthopedic implant products along with continued overall investment in our sales forces. ", "This quarter also includes an impairment charge to write-off patents associated with the spinal interbody fusion cage products obtained in the 2002 surgical dynamics acquisition. ", "The U.S. FDA recently downgraded the classification of these products, making approval for potential competitors easier and triggering our impairment review. ", "In addition, interbody spacers have supplanted the use of cages by many clinicians. Our spine business is red hot, but sales of cages are not. ", "We continue to be pleased with many other aspects of this acquisition. That concluded, the patents associated with the acquired cage products were impaired and should be written-off. ", "After adjusting for the impairment charge, operating income increased 16% in the quarter and operating margin increased to 22.9% of sales. ", "Now, I'll give you a quick breakdown of the other income and expense category for the quarter that was $16.9 million of income in the quarter, that's comprised of $19.5 million of investment income and a foreign currency transaction gain of $400,000. Those two items are offset by interest expense of $3 million in the quarter. ", "But the company's effective income tax rates were 27.6% and 27.9% for the second quarter and first half of 2007 respectively. These rates are down from last year's second quarter first half and the year ended December 31, 2006. However, the rates for last year's first half and year reflect the impact of the non-deductible charge for Sightline purchased in process research and development. This year\u2019s second quarter rate is also favorably impacted by a higher than average rate on a tax benefited associated with patent impairment charge. ", "And then turning to the balance sheet, we continue to believe that that\u2019s in very good shape. Asset management information has been restated to reflect our continuing operations only. This has had a very negligible effect on accounts receivable days, but restated inventory days generally jump up 15 to 20 days in any given period. Accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 58 days, up one day compared to the prior quarter and the prior year. Inventory days finished the quarter at 149 days, up three day in the quarter and just one day above the June 2006 level. ", "We would look to slow down the plans and drive these comparative inventory levels down as we complete the year. For perspective purposes, the restated inventory days for December 2006 finished at a 138 days. And then just real briefly on the rest of the balance sheet, we do have a $17 million of debt outstanding and that\u2019s all in the currency category at the end of this quarter. ", "And just briefly on cash flow. We are having a strong year from a cash flow perspective. We are pleased to have generated $364 million cash from operations in the first half compared to $217 million at this time last year, an increase of 68%. We are obviously in great shape to deliver another excellent year in cash and from operations. ", "With that I will turn it back over to Steve. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks, Dean, and now just a few additional comments on our 2007 outlook. Halfway through the year, we feel good about delivering on our sales and income commitments. On the sales front, we are clearly on track to deliver a seventh straight year of double-digit sales growth. ", "With the divestiture of Physiotherapy, our full year sales are likely to be towards the higher end of the 11% to 13% operational guidance that we initially established for the year. With $1.19 per share, in first half adjusted earnings, we are also on plan to deliver 20% EPS growth of $2.40 a share for the year. And we are doing this, we might add, with a slightly higher tax rate and share count than we had planned. ", "With strong cash generation and the sale of our Physiotherapy division, our cash balance is now about $1.8 billion and becoming a source of more questions and speculation about the potential for acquisitions and/or stock buybacks. Simply put, we are biding our time. With the strong underlying performance of our business, we are in a position of strength and can afford to be patient, a trait which has served us well over the years. ", "We will now open it up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan. Please proceed, sir. ", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Thank you. Good evening and congratulations on a fantastic quarter. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks, Mike. ", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "And happy birthday, Steve ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thank you very much; it had to be a good quarter, right? ", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "It had to be, you know it. Couple of things I think I would like to focus on, one is both the Instruments and Endoscopy pieces are so strong in the U.S. and obviously we are all aware of the products you have launched over the last six to 12 months. Can you just talk a little bit about the uptake of the few product, that you have launched and where you think those launches are in their adoption cycles, for those two businesses. And then I think the other question I would focus on would be on the spending side and it's mainly the amount that you increased your SG&A and R&D lines was pretty remarkable. I would just like to hear a little bit more about where you are spending those incremental dollars, because I would think it's hard to spend that much money definitely and would love to hear where the R&D dollars are going and where are those extra dollars from the SG&A are going? Thanks. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. Thanks, Mike. Let\u2019s start with the Instruments and Endo. We clearly saw the 1188 camera and System Six, both generating growth for those segment well north of probably 20-25% in the quarter. And we are probably in about the fourth inning Dean would you say. ", "Dean Bergy", "That\u2019s right, sir. ", "Steve MacMillan", "In terms of where we are in those launches, in other words a lot of trialing going on certainly in the first quarter and we started to see clearly the order started to come through in the second quarter and think there is still a lot of life that both products are being very well received. ", "In terms of the R&D and SG&A lines. I would tell you on the SG&A front we are continuing to build out sales forces really around the world and I think you are seeing some of the impact on that, some of that in our trauma business in the U.S., other parts is the MedSurg business outside the United States and so we will probably continue to invest where things are coming in well. We are still putting additional bodies on to the street and that will continue to payback here in the future. ", "On the R&D front, I think as Dean mentioned also we would tell you we feel pretty good about the pipelines across every division, and the spending really is very broad-based, almost division-by-division to keep the product flow coming in. And I think we probably feel better about our continued ability to generate product flow coming in over the next few years on a broad basis than probably we have felt in sometime. Now, again, the proof is going to be in the pudding, we're going to have to deliver it in the quarters ahead, with things like hip resurfacing just starting to come through. Certainly, the System 6 precision, 1188, we're already working on next generations of those and things like that. ", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "And Steve, just an update, but maybe at some point you could give us a breakdown of how you allocate your R&D spending between different programs, not how the men are talking across the businesses but within businesses between innovative projects and new technologies and so forth. I think that given the increase in R&D dollars the company has allocated over the last few years and I think that would be helpful and if you can give us that today that would be great. ", "And then just coming back to last question, on the incremental fees, the people you are adding on the SG&A side. Anything you can give us there to give us a sense of how meaningful that is? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. Let me take the R&D piece first and it probably a deeper discussion maybe at a future analyst meeting where we can give you a little bit more, but I'd say again on probably a high level basis for R&D, we are continuing all the blocking and tackling, what we call the incremental innovation within each division and most of the divisions have taken on what we would call is probably one or two double or triples in the pipeline, some of which make, hopefully all of which will come to fruition, some of which may or may not. ", "But we're really looking at each R&D budget division-by-division: Can that division handle it? Can the company handle it? as well as do they have the people in place to try to bring those things through? I think to your point, we will try to give a little more elucidation around that, maybe at next year's analyst meeting. ", "Regarding the additional feed on the street, I think it's been again probably incremental, both geographically and franchise vice. It's not like we've gone and heaved up a dramatic huge impact in any one geography or any one business, but it's back to just like our product flow, adding a lot of singles here around the world seems to be paying off for us. ", "Mike Weinstein - JP Morgan", "Okay. That\u2019s great and thanks, Steve, Dean and Katherine there congratulations. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Great, I'll thank you Mike. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Lehman Brothers, please proceed sir. ", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks very much and again congratulations on a great quarter. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks Bob. ", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Just want to follow-up Stephen your comments about M&A and buyback. Because it seems to me there is a little bit of shift from the way you have been communicating earlier. I mean earlier in the year at a conference for example, you were talking about potentially adding a division. You had also, I think on a last conference call mentioned that, towards the year end this year, you would communicate further about, what you might be dealing with in terms of cash that\u2019s a piling up on the balance sheet. So just wondering, should we read comments that M&A is kind of off the table this year and that the cash is just going to accumulate on the balance sheet. I just wondered if you could clarify those comments about bidding your time? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, Bob. I think probably the best way to say is, may be as people keep pressing me for particular time frames, may be I haven\u2019t been as good at clarifying. ", " We are working at stuff, but as you M&A, we are not going to be held with time table, and not going to do a deal this year, just to try to do one. ", "So, I think, with the underlying strength of our business we are certainly looking, and I think that the broad comment that we would love to add a division is a great one. Whether that is going to materialize this year or next year or the following year, probably not as clear, so I probably want to make sure that I am indicating, there is nothing imminent, we are clearly looking in with Katherine on board, stepping up our game in that area. But I probably do want to temper expectations and we are more comfortable, we are very comfortable, continuing to build even though people want better answers and want more specific time tables for what we might do in this area. ", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks and then two other little ones. On the hip resurfacing side, when do you think you will be in full launch mode after you got a critical mass trained and when should be kind of think about that? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. It's probably helpful to put in perspective the way we are going to go about the training. First off, we think the FDA put a lot of trust and confidence in us to make sure that we do the training right here. And we are really going about doing the training the first program actually starts tomorrow, where we are training 14 surgeons. And we are going to have a series of lots of programs around the country, training 15 or 20. This is not the kind of thing you bring 200 people in for a weekend and send them off the next week. ", "We are very committed to wanting to make sure that surgeons are properly trained because as will know the placement and particularly the angulations in getting these things right are critical for the long-term success of hip resurfacing. So we are going to be really focused over the next three months particularly on training and even beyond that. ", "In terms of meaningful impact, therefore certainly would not expect much this quarter in the U.S., probably starting to see some impact in the fourth quarter. And I would tell you for a purely commercial basis, the demand is there. We could drive sales faster and given our performance in hips over the last couple years, I would tell you its pretty tempting, but having said that, we are really thinking about the long-term here. ", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then just lastly quickly I\u2019d like you know what you are feeding your spine sales force? Very strong numbers out of you guys and just curious if you could provide a little more detail on what\u2019s going on there? Do you think you are dealing with the healthy market? Do you think this is primarily share gains, just any other color that would be great? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. I would tell you we are really, really proud of the leadership we have of our spine division and of that sale force and have a great people. I think if you take out a 50,000 foot level, think about it from four years ago. Four years ago we were nothing in spine, we were a Recon company that dabbled in spine. And so the thought leaders didn\u2019t really view Stryker as a serious player in spine. ", "And I think when our leadership of our Spinal division, combined with dramatically expanding our product flow, this has been one of the areas we have been over investing in R&D and we have dramatically broadened our product line in spine over the last few years from really being a just a thoracolumbar business to having now a good presence and surgical presence in the interbody spacers and everything else. So we have been filling out the bag and getting a lot of confidence and frankly a lot of surgeons who really are seeing Stryker I think as a company that really is starting to be on the leading edge in Spine and it's all sort of feeding on itself, creating a lot of confidence and support and belief that we want to continue to certainly feed that beast. ", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thanks so much guys. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks Bob. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marc Mullikin with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed sir. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon. Nice quarter. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thank you, Marc. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "I guess I would like to push a little bit more on the plans for the Cormet here in the U.S. Can you give us an idea of how many surgeons you would expect to train in total maybe in the first year? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Marc, as you may know we tend to not get into the specifics of numbers because we are going to focus on quality, and we don't like to play the game as saying, we are going to train 300 and then come back and say, we beat our expectation and trained 400. We are really still developing those plans and probably I'll just let the result, the sales results ultimately speak for themselves. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And I guess, with respect to the protocol for training here. Is it substantially different from the protocol being followed by your competitors? ", "Steve MacMillan", "I am not aware of it being significantly different. ", "Dean Bergy", "One thing I would say Marc, as Steve I think alluded to, we do feel like our instrumentation should help to set us apart here in this category. I don't know that the protocol of that is different necessarily. But the instrumentation we think has been very reactive to the information that came out of the clinical study that was done in the U.S. and should help to really focus U.S. surgeons as they get involved here. And what needs to be done and we have taken that really in to account in terms of how we design the instruments and that carries over obviously into how the procedure is done. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And do you expect this to maybe reinvigorate your total hip business or what do you need to do to really reinvigorate the total hip side of the business here? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure Marc, we would call it a step in the reinvigoration and we think frankly a very importantly step that probably more than anything psychologically is a huge boost to our sales force. We've been very enamored with the success we had on Triathlon and for the last really a year or two its been a lot easier if your Stryker sales reps to just focus on knees because Triathlon has been going so well. This gives them a great avenue to get back and to start talking about hips again. And I would say you should expect that we also know that there will be additional products coming in our hip portfolio here over the coming years. Probably nothing else this year, but as we go into next year, hopefully starting that to also reinvigorate the primary hip line. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Is the total metal-on-metal replacement in the pipeline? ", "Steve MacMillan", "We prefer not to talk about the specifics of what's in the pipeline. We are looking at it at a number of different things. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, fair enough. And then just finally, on the U.S. trauma growth, to me that\u2019s even more phenomenal than the spine. And I was wondering if you could provide some color, maybe in terms of price volume mix or any color you can provide as to what's really driving growth north of 30%? ", "Steve MacMillan", "It is mostly volume mix. There is a little bit of positive pricing in there, but its tremendous volume and mix games, a chunk of that is volume. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Do you have a sense of where you are getting the market share, because clearly the market is not growing at that rate? ", "Steve MacMillan", "We prefer not to take steps that way. I think we just feel good that we're obviously growing faster than the market. ", "Marc Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Very good, thank you. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Great, thanks Marc. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jared Holz of Bear Stearns. Please proceed sir. ", "Jared Holz - Bear Stearns", "Good afternoon. Nice Job, guys. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks, Jared. ", "Jared Holz - Bear Stearns", "Just want to add to the first question on hip resurfacing. You see, in Europe and Australia, the penetration rates of hip resurfacing, compared to total hip procedures is roughly 15% to 20%, high teens, and that\u2019s being generated by two, much smaller, companies. So with your presence in here, do you think you can get that penetration rate to over 20 and what's your thought and what you have been hearing on that? ", "Steve MacMillan", "We think over time that would be a very aggressive number. I think we are probably planning in the 10 to 15 range and we would say though that we do think most of that is incremental. Because you are largely appealing to patients today, that aren\u2019t going to necessarily go in and have a total hip, and ultimately I think where we will be and we are now, it ultimately settles out, we are not sure. Could it be as high as 20 or 25 down the road if there is lot of success? Maybe, but I think that is going take certainly a long, long time. So our mindset is really more in the 10 to 25 range for the market. ", "Jared Holz - Bear Stearns", "Okay, great. And then just gross margins, meaningfully higher than they have been obviously because of the divestiture, but going forward, ending the year at roughly 68%. Is that where you guys think you can be? ", "Steve MacMillan", "We think we will reach up a touch over last year, probably not as strongly ahead to second half of the year has been than the first half. As Dean mentioned, the third quarter we have slightly tougher comparables from last year. But we feel good about continuing to try to make again what we would very much call as incremental progress here. Dean, do you want to add to that? ", "Dean Bergy", "No, I think that\u2019s good information, Steve. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Okay ", "Jared Holz - Bear Stearns", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Dean Bergy", "Great, thanks Jared. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes with Leerink Swann. Please proceed sir. ", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Hi. Thank you very much. Just have some more follow ups on the hip resurfacing product. Can you explain with that in terms of profitability? Is this a more profitable product in your traditional hip line or do the royalties and manufacturing cost eat up some of that profitability? ", "Dean Bergy", "Yeah, Jason, the gross margins on this product are going to be lower, we have talked about that and that\u2019s solely from the standpoint that it\u2019s a license product. We do have an agreement to buy it at a transfer price but as Steve said because it\u2019s incremental market opportunity, we view the total gain as being incrementally targeted overtime as we start to get into it. ", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "So basically we should be thinking, you are thinking that's sort of is potentially 10 to 15% of the market that could board over to hip resurfacing, that\u2019s largely incremental or I mean I assume there would be some cannibalization from the traditional markets. ", "Steve MacMillan", "We think that would be more incremental than what people are factoring. I think the way we first look at it, there will be a lower gross margin on this thing but on a penny profit basis it should grow our total profitability. ", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And then the trauma growth was certainly impressive and if I recall, my memory is not being 100%here, about a year ago you started hiring somewhat aggressively in that division. Can we assume that this has taken about a year but now you are getting some pay offs there? And then secondly, it sounds like you are going to continue to invest in that sales force still. Is that the way to think about trauma from an ongoing basis? ", "Steve MacMillan", "We think your memory serves you very well Jason and you are dead on. Its clearly paid off for us and therefore we think there is additional opportunity to continue to expand somewhat and that\u2019s\u2019 what we have been doing and again our SG&A is running pretty hot, we would expect to see that starts to slow down as we really do start to realize some of the gains from the investments we have been making there. ", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "But it does sound like for the rest of the year you are going to keep it hot or is this sort of key quarter for you in terms of SG&A? ", "Dean Bergy", "I think it could slow down a little bit, Jason. I mean the thing it goes hand in hand with is the gross margin debt related to the shift and mix of business and the next quarter is a little bit lower in SG&A percentage usually too. But I think we'll also take advantages of opportunities to invest in the business where we can get them too, if the price comes down a little bit on a percentage of sales basis. ", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "A final housekeeping question. Could you provide the impact of acquisitions for this quarter, if you are on it? ", "Steve MacMillan", "On sales growth? ", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Yes. ", "Steve MacMillan", "It's zero. ", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann", "Okay. That's easy. Thank you very much. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Great. Thanks, Jason. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch of, BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed Ma'am. ", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Good afternoon. In regards to acquisition I can't seem not talk to an investor that doesn't think you are buying almost everything in orthopedics. Could you narrow down the scope a little bit for the way for what you maybe looking at? I am not going to ask when, but what you maybe looking at and what criteria in regards to dilution etcetera you may consider? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, Joanne. We continue to look really at product based acquisitions. I mean, I think the Cormet hip which is a licensing deal. We continue to look for products that might fill voids and we would look at other subcategories and things are revolving, so we continue to look. ", "Also, frankly, out of a lot of that looking, we often are seeing ideas that are opening our eyes. And I'll give you a very real example of that. We looked at hand innovations a couple of years ago and our team said, we have a great Distal Radius product, what we need to do is invest in a sales force because we have the product and we chose to pass on that acquisition and make an internal investment in our selling organization, which is part of our trauma business, and built up a little bit of a dedicated force there. So, part of what we look at also makes us smart to realize there are other things that we can do organically and that\u2019s why it's kind of a back and forth process. ", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Is there anything you can update us on the department of justice investigations? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Nothing at this point, we continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice. ", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "And then one last question, how tight are you feeling these days to that 20%. ", "Steve MacMillan", "We continue to feel, that certainly over the short and medium term, that it\u2019s something we can clearly deliver and we take a lot of pride in that. As you know we set the bar high, we don\u2019t play the game of, set the bar low and jump over it. We set the bar high and then try to hit it and feel pretty good about our ability to do that. And we're constantly focused. It very much focuses us to not get complacent, after a quarter like this it will be pretty easy to sit there and pat ourselves on the back I think, and we're already nervous about how we keep it going and that\u2019s part of magic of the 20% for us. ", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Well, happy birthday and congratulations, Katherine. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Thank you, Johanna. I am sure Katherine, see that. ", "Katherine Owen", "Many thanks. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line Michael Matson with Wachovia Securities, please proceed sir. ", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Yes, I was wondering if you could give us your perspective now that we've got Medtronic coming into the spine market with Cervical Disk product. Are there any concerns there that, that might steal a little market share from your spine business in terms of the cervical plating area. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure great question. Obviously Medtronic is such a strong force in the spinal marketplace and we are still a small player relative to them, we have tremendous respect for them and we are sure that those discs, they will do a good job with. Having said that, our Spinal business is still really only a small portion, and is in cervical. It has been part of the business we have been building and developing and I think the good part for us is, it's not like we have a huge cervical business that will get beaten up. Will it get dented and I would say, with growth rate slow, probably a bit, but we still see opportunities for us there. ", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Okay. And then, I know that you have been making a push in Europe with some of the MedSurg businesses and we have seen some very strong hospital capital expenditure in the U.S. I was just wondering, how things look in Europe in the hospital capital budgets, and trends there? ", "Steve MacMillan", "I think we continue to see pretty good trends in Europe in the CapEx side. If anything we see some tightening on the implant side, in this and that, but there is still some reasonable upgrading going on in the hospital spending there. ", "Dean Bergy", "And I think, like if you look at it, a category like i-Suites - which who knows if the potential will be in Europe as it would be the U.S, but certainly in relative penetration terms - we are seeing a little of that and even some of our navigation equipment. I think there are some opportunities that we are seeing start to take hold in some of those markets. ", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Okay, and then one question. You mentioned, the overall pricing was roughly flat for the Company. I was just wondering if you could comment on U.S. pricing specifically with regard to the hip and knee or the Recon portion of the market. I am assuming it was probably roughly flat, but I mean if that\u2019s wrong? ", "Steve MacMillan", "No, that\u2019s a fair assumption, it\u2019s in line pretty much. ", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "And you kind of expect that trend to continue in the near-term? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah, I would say so. ", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Securities", "Okay, that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got, thanks. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Clearly, thanks Mike. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ed Shenkan with Needham & Company. Please proceed sir. ", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "Thanks, Steve. Regarding the cage devices, tell us when you come out with your cage devices? Is that more an add-on for the strength of your spine business or is it really a differentiated product that we are looking at here that's in its own is going to really drive revenues? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Ed, as it relates to cages, the cages really were an acquisition we made of SDI in 2002 that candidly have not materialized all that well. We've really moved that business more towards in interbody spacer part of our business and we are seeing great growth in the interbody space that really has largely supplanted a lot of the cage stuff for, so we wouldn't expect any additional cage volume going forward. ", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "Thanks for clarifying. Thanks, Steve. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Great, Thanks, Ed. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Morgan Stanley. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, Hi Matt. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "So I think we have sort of turned over all the rocks and I just had a couple of follow up questions on couple of areas, one was spine again very strong and kudos to you and team. In terms of productivity I am wondering, you obviously have some strong product cycles driving that business but are you still coming up the curve in terms of the productivity of your sales force, and kind of think as when do you get there? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, we have made a lot of progress on the productivity and sales force still some opportunities. We've still been hiring, we still had some younger folks that are coming up that curve but I would say we are a lot further up that curve today than we were 12 months ago. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. So, I mean, through the end of the year or is this something that continues until next year where you still see this? ", "Steve MacMillan", "It will probably, continue. I would say the rate at which we're improving productivity is clearly that which will be a slower rate. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, quick just follow-up on DOJ everyone continues to work with the DOJ, but there was some specific announcements from some of your competitors and I am sure you saw the article a couple of months ago that seems to just indicate that things were more active now say than they were six-months or nine-months ago in terms of a dialogue. Is that consistent with what you are seeing or is this something that visibility is sort of starting to maybe improve? ", "Steve MacMillan", "It's hard for us to really comment on that. The DOJ they are obviously working with five different companies and we only know what is going on with us and we are continuing to work with them, and the rest is all hearsay also but again, I think because it's across an industry, its harder for us to comment and then it would be probably the U.S. Attorney. Sorry, we can't give you more on that. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "It's okay. And then, just one final follow-up on trauma, I mean, it kicked-off quite a bit earlier and faster than we were expecting. Is this the rate we are looking at sort of service sustainable high-teens, double-digit kind of rate or is this something we should expect to moderate in the next couple of quarters? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Clearly, we don't expect our U.S. business to continue. The 31% in the first quarter shocked us. I would tell you that as we were seeing the second quarter unfold to 35%, it shocked us even more, and where obviously just the sheer size and magnitude of that business, have gotten very big, very quickly. So, we would clearly expect those growth rates to come down. Having said that, we would hope to continue to grow our trauma business at above market rates going forward. But that clearly would come down into the, call it, mid to high teens as opposed to up where we are now. I think in the U.S., we're not going to be in the 30's again. We all wouldn\u2019t expect it to be. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "And then one final follow up on the hip re-servicing, is that something that where Smith & Nephew obviously have seen pretty generous price premium over a standard hip system. I mean is this, we've seen in the past when new technology hits the market, two or three other players join that leader and then price starts to kind of come in. Is that kind of phenomena we should expect here or is there something like revisions are obviously paid at a higher level and have sustained a higher price over time. How should we think about resurfacing? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Our hope would be that it could sustain the higher price. There is a lot in this between the training, the product, the instrumentation that\u2019s all new and unique. So, I think we would expect it to be there for a while hopefully. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. That\u2019s helpful. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Great. Thank you, Matt. ", "Matt Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Robert Faulkner with Thomas Weisel Partners, please proceed sir. ", "Robert Faulkner - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thanks, good evening gentlemen. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Hi Rob. ", "Robert Faulkner - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I wanted to know if we could focus on mention the macro drivers of about the orthopedic business in hips and knees. I even heard you comment recently on the pricing environment for hips and knees from a hospital perspective. Obviously, the numbers speak for themselves, but I feel like it is getting better, getting worse, stable. Do you see any warning flags on the horizon, on the MedSurg side, or you can both side of the way here. What do you track to see, what demand might be if anything, is it hospital construction, how far out do you look, that kind of thing? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. On the Recon pricing, we continue to see it being fairly flattish, which is what it's been all the last probably five, six quarters and I think, consistent with about what we expected, as it relates to MedSurg. We really look at two things, one is procedure by procedure, what are the opportunities for us in our MedSurg business. And some of that business goes frankly with orthopedic surgeries such as our heavy duty power tools, in the case of our Arthroscopic Equipment, it clearly goes along the lines of some of the minimal invasive surgery and sports medicine procedures. ", "So there is both the procedural component and then clearly as it relates to the hospital beds, stretchers, or the Endo Suites, which are the big capital items. That tends to near a little bit more, both new construction of hospitals as well as refurbishments. So really, each of our MedSurg business\u2019s tracks a little differently. If you line up our medical business, our instruments business and our Endo business, each have different components, related to both, what we call base and capital. So we are really tracking both across franchises and across geographies. ", "Robert Faulkner - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great, and finally, maybe you said this before, what do you think the ultimate penetration potential for hip resurfacing is in the U.S? Do you think it\u2019s higher or lower than Europe? ", "Steve MacMillan", "I think we are figuring at ultimately it will probably near what we probably call some of the other Anglo countries, if you look at Australia, the U.K. and Canada, which is where its to figure and its probably in that 10% to 15% range. I would tell you we also want to make sure it happens right. I think our big theory is it could take off really quickly and potentially you could have some complications down the road. We will want to limit that and that\u2019s why we really want to emphasize the training, so we get it right. ", "Robert Faulkner - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great, and I know you don\u2019t normally break this out, Dean but do you have any sense of for Stryker profitability, I mean do you have any sense how much mix is contributing to the market overall in the U.S. and hips and knees? ", "Dean Bergy", "In wide specific part in U.S? ", "Robert Faulkner - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hips and knees? Or you don\u2019t\u2026? ", "Dean Bergy", "Yeah, I don\u2019t have those numbers at the top of my fingertips, but it\u2019s no more than just 1% to 2% somewhere in that range.

Please proceed sir. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Hey, guys, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, Jeff. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Just a couple of small things here left for me, I apologize if these are repeated, I don\u2019t think they are. But on the sideline product that we are still shooting for a late 2007 launch there and if you can just kind of maybe remind us about the challenges and the opportunities and going into the flexible endoscopy market? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, we are still shooting for late 2007. I will tell you we are in that stage now of really trying to make sure that the commercialization is there. So it's fine tuning the product and making sure that it\u2019s scalable to produce and running into our usual issues there along the way that we continue to work through the knock off one by one as we proceed close to the market. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Great, any challenges there, I would assume that this is just kind of dropping to your current sales force bags if you will? ", "Steve MacMillan", "We actually will probably have a more dedicated sales force focused on the GI audience, and I think that the product should be well received once we know full how to make it, we want to make sure we've got the quality of that product since its a new category for us. We want to make sure that we've got that totally nailed before we come to market. So the challenge is probably more internal at this point and then the next challenge will be external once we take it out there. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Great. And the last question then, is any update at all on your conversations with the FDA regarding OP-1 and where that might be going in spine fusion? ", "Steve MacMillan", "I think our comment on OP-1 overall, as we continue to be very committed to the product and are continuing to spend behind it, but frankly just because we don't want to disappoint, we'd encourage everybody to take that in your models and we will be back to you at a future point. ", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "All right. That's all I got. Thanks guys. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Great. Thanks Jeff.

", "Steve MacMillan", "Hi, Steve. ", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America", "Just a couple of follow-ups. In MedSurg, can you give us maybe a little bit more detail on the new product that you acquired in instruments and the opportunity there. And then also little bit more on the new product launch you mentioned in medical, I guess from the second quarter? ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, Steve. The products we acquired at instruments, one is essentially a tourniquet system. We think it's a competitive and potentially a better tourniquet system that will be sold really via our instrument sales force. And then also we acquired a level of consciousness monitor, which we think is going to be one of those categories that will become much more prominent to and take-off more in the years ahead. ", "There is a company out there today. You may know that Aspect Medical, they are by far the leader in that space. We think we have a product that may have some advantages and we will be going into that really with the anesthesiologist and bringing that product to market here. So, they will be both built overtime. But we think that the kind of things that just like Neptune and other things. We will look back in four or five years and have some very nice franchises out of those. ", "And your other question. And the bed, we basically just want to take critical care bed at medical which are bed franchises much slower in the second quarter, we see that will be probably bouncing back. The initial reviews on this critical care bed is called the in touch, its got a lot of software, really makes the nurses life easier, allows for some remote patient monitoring, other things. We think it will be a very nice product in the marketplace. ", "Steven Lichtman - Banc of America", "Great, thanks. Steven and just quickly, you mentioned on the tax rate may be coming in a little bit higher this year than you expected. Dean, what should we be looking for the tax rate looking forward here? ", "Dean Bergy", "Well, we are comfortable, with where it is right now, though we've continued to say that there is downward bias and if that could happen this year it could push into next year. But we certainly think overtime there is continued downward bias. And I have said kind of up to 50 basis points is the way to think about it in the near to mid term.

", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Real quick, can you give us the names of either the companies or the products that you acquired in the MedSurg with the tourniquet system and the consciousness monitor. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, the tourniquet was instrument and the level of conscious monitor was a company called Everest. ", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Everest, okay. And then, I know I am beating a dead horse here now I apologize ahead of time, but how important to you is the level of dilution in regards to potential acquisitions. ", "Steve MacMillan", "That still is a good question. I think the way we think about dilution is we would be willing to tolerate some dilution in the shorter term. I don\u2019t think we would want to sign up for two or three years of dilution, but clearly dilution in a year that was going to accretive in the out years, even diluted year one, breakeven year two, accretive year three, we would think about that. ", "I think probably the biggest issue for us, as it relates to acquisitions, everybody keeps asking us is, we are going to continue to be patient, we are absolutely looking at acquisitions, but we are in a real great position right now, and I think we can afford to be picky and selective. ", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. And how hard is it to get one of your division managers or presidents, group presidents to sign off on a dilutive deal on their division now? ", "Steve MacMillan", "They are all primed and ready, they do. I mean frankly, the sideline deal is a dilutive deal. We have actually done several over the last couple of years that we have actually been able to cover and then the next ones could be, if we go buy a company that could become it's own division, that would probably have a higher degree of dilution and that would be something we handle more at the corporate level and probably would be able to cover. So we would take that dilution short-term. ", "But we also recognize, we don\u2019t want to do anything that is going to spook people. But we are also going to continue to run the business well and continue to be on the prowl. But hopefully, what people are used to and comfortable with is, knowing we are not going to something stupid. ", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Okay. And then two and then just on the TDR's, where are you with the CerviCore program at this point in time and then on Flexicore, I believe the endpoint was a non inferiority end point considering Medtronics push on their lumber disc for a superiority end point. Do you think it might be disadvantage considering that and if you surely have. Thanks. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, first on your CerviCore question, we are probably in the 8th depending on the terms of enrollments on our CerviCore trial and on FlexiCore it is non-inferiority. We think the product itself will ultimately have some meaningful points of difference and then some of the other stuff we will be able do around. It should still provide for a meaningful advantage.

Guys I had a few questions, one was concerning U.S. hip and knee unit growth. `06 was sluggish to us about 2% to 3% unit growth and prior five years, before that it was 7%, 8%. This `06 or `07 rather showing return to the ago more robust 7%, 8% unit growth. ", "The second question in terms of Flexible endoscope opportunity, isn\u2019t it fact you\u2019re your looking for such flexible endoscopic market is on the order of $2 billion, looking at five years, what\u2019s the scale of that from Stryker\u2019s point of view. Could it be $200 million business or $500 million business? Any help there would be great. ", "And the third question really pertains to in BioMed\u2019s press release regarding the DOJ settlement Steve kind of spoke about the risk of a fundamental change in business practices, selling practices. Do you see from Stryker`s point of view, do you seen any fundamental sea change in how business is conducted in relationship with doctors? Thank so much. ", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. Thanks Bruce. I'll take those in order. I think on the hip growth, we probably see '07 being a little bit better than the trough year, probably not quite as strong as it was in, called as golden age years of '03,'04. ", "On Sightline, I think we see the category very close to $1 billion in terms of the flexible world and I think we'd be quite happy to get to a $100 millionish business over time in terms of expectations and we will see where that goes. It's obviously, going to be a tough and new market for us, but I think we would be taking more along that line than certainly the 500 million number that you mentioned.

Please proceed.", "Steve MacMillan", "", "Thankyou, Katrina. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Stryker's third quarter2007 earnings report. With me today are Dean Bergy, our Vice President andChief Financial Officer, and Katherine Owen, Vice President of CorporateStrategy and Investor Relations.", "From start to finish our results this quarter were fundamentallyvery strong, while additionally benefiting from currency, as well as one extraselling day in the United States. Net sales of $1.45 billion were up 18% and up15.7% operationally, while net earnings also grew over 20%.", "We stated at the start of the year that our primary focuswas on executing against what we felt were strong organic growth opportunities.As we began to realize the impact of our R&D and sales force investmentsfrom the last couple of years, we believe this quarter's results, on top of twoalready strong quarters, demonstrate that this exceptional focus is serving uswell.", "Overall, the 15.7% operational growth was our strongest inthe last several years and represented another sequential up tick from lastquarter, as the breadth and depth of our unique set of businesses, once again, contributed to strong growth.", "A few highlights, which includes an acceleration ofinternational sales from single-digit growth last quarter to low double-digitlevels this quarter. This growth was widespread with hips, knees, trauma andour endoscopy franchises all showing accelerating international growth in thequarter.", "Our growth was again broadly based and balanced. On areported basis, growth rates for U.S. and international were both18%, with the international growth up 11% operationally.", "In the U.S.,Orthopaedic Implants were up 16% while MedSurg reached 20%. Globally, OrthopaedicImplants were up 13% operationally, and MedSurg was up a strong 20%.", "Our U.S. spine and trauma businesses continue to performexceptionally, both growing around 30% in the quarter. Seven of our eightglobal franchises again generated global double-digit operational growth.", "We also know that a number of you often wonder about thesustainability of our MedSurg businesses. Well, we are pleased to report thatthese important franchises continue to post stellar growth. In fact, for thefirst time this decade, our endoscopy and the instruments franchises bothposted 20% or greater growth in the U.S. and globally in the samequarter. And medical reached 17% domestic growth in the quarter.", "While each of these businesses accelerated versus lastquarter and are clearly running above their long-term expected growth rates,they continue to deliver strong underlying and sustainable growth. To provide alittle context here, this represented the 33rd consecutive quarter ofdouble-digit growth for our global endoscopy business.", "Instruments have generated double-digit growth in 21 of thelast 22 quarters. And medical posted its 16th consecutive quarter ofdouble-digit growth. While this quarter may have been exceptionally strong, wecontinue to feel very good about our ability to deliver strong and sustainableMetSurg growth.", "While the quarter brought a lot of highlights, there are alwaysthings we can do better. At the top of this list remains our hip franchise,making the July FDA clearance of our hip resurfacing product very welcome news.", "We are currently focused on conducting comprehensive surgeontraining, and therefore do not expect the meaningful contribution fromresurfacing until next year. But, it is very nice to now have this in our bagheading into 2008.", "Secondly, while our Japanese business showed some stabilityin the quarter, the price cuts continue to take a toll.", "And finally, we continue to work on enhancing our qualityand regulatory systems to better meet the increasing standards at FDA. When westep back from it, however, we are encouraged that despite the softness in oneof our largest franchises and year-to-date declines in our second largestcountry, Japan,we are posting very healthy growth rates.", "Finally, the quarter also brought a welcome resolution tothe DOJ investigation, which began in 2005. We have now wrapped up two of theseinvestigations, orthopaedic as well as physiotherapy in the last two quarters,and are pleased to be looking forward.", "In conclusion, it was a very nice quarter, and while wewould like to celebrate, we very much feel the pressure of the highexpectations which we have established, and therefore our investors have forus. Our team remains focused on delivering today, while investing and planningto keep the growth coming.", "I will now turn it over to Dean for more details.", "Dean Bergy", "Thanks, Steve. I'll begin with the impact of the foreigncurrency and sales. Our foreign currency was again favorable this quarter,adding $29 million to international sales and boosting the company's overallsales growth by 2.3%.", "In the third quarter, the dollar weekend approximately 8%against the Euro and strengthened about 2% against the Yen compared to theprior year. If currency rates hold near current levels, we expect the impact offoreign currency will increase fourth quarter 2007 sales by about 2.5% to 3%when compared to the prior year, which would bring the projected favorableimpact on the total year of 2007 sales to just over 2%.", "And now looking at price volume in the quarter, its prettysimple here. Foreign currency, as you have seen in the press release,contributed 2 points of growth in the quarter and the remaining growth all camefrom volume and mix, so there was 16% volume mix growth or 18% total growth.", "Selling prices were flat in the quarter, domestic priceswere up modestly, but this was offset by a hit to our international sales volumefrom the price declines in Japan.Japanese pricing was down 7% in the third quarter, reflecting the impact of theJanuary 1 and April 1, 2007 MHLW reimbursement cuts.", "Volume mix growth, as I said, was 16% in the third quarter,a 2 point acceleration from the second quarter. Domestic volume mix came in at17% and did benefit one extra selling day in the quarter compared to the prioryear. International volume mix growth of 12% accelerated from 9% in each of thefirst two quarters.", "And now turning to our business segments. Orthopaedic Implants,which represents 60% of our sales, saw increased of 15% in the third quarter ona reported basis and 13% operationally. The sales growth reach by product linesare included in our press release and I'll reference those rates, as I providemore detail on performance in each products category.", "So turning to hips, hips were up 9% in dollars and 6% inconstant currency in the quarter. The global operational hip growth ratematched that from the second quarter. US hip growth finished at 6% andwas led by sales of X3 Polyethylene inserts, Accolade cementless hips andRestoration Modular Revision Hip products.", "Although we officially launched the Cormet Hip Resurfacing productline in the U.S.in the quarter, it did not contribute meaningfully to the sales volume, as ourprimary efforts in this arena were focused on training and education.", "In Europe, hips grew at lowdouble-digit operational rates, led by Trident, X3 Polyethylene, MITCHresurfacing and Accolade products.", "In Japan,local currency hip sales declined in mid-to-high single-digit levels. MHLWprice reductions were responsible for all of the decline, with volumes up justslightly.", "A Secur-Fit Hip product saw reasonable volume growth, butthis was partially offset by declines in BiPolar, Omnifit and Centaur products.", "Operational hip growth in the remaining internationalmarkets came in at low double-digit levels, led by strong in Latin America.", "Now turning to knees, they were up 16% in dollars and 13% inlocal currency in this quarter. Knees posted another very good quarter. U.S.knee sales were up 14%, with primary knees registering mid-teens growth and therevision category growing at low double-digit levels. Primary growth was againdominated by Triathlon and X3 and Scorpio led the way in revision.", "In Europe, local currencygrowth came in at low-to-mid double-digits, led by exceptionally strongTriathlon growth and steady sales of Scorpio.", "Japanese knee sales grew at mid-to-high single-digitsoperationally, with the growth attributable to our Scorpio NRG product line.The remaining international markets posted aggregate mid-teens level, localcurrency knee growth with Triathlon posting excellent results in the Pacificand Canada and Scorpioleading the way in Latin America.", "Now turning to trauma, that product line was up 19% indollars and 16% on operational basis in the third quarter. Our trauma businesshad another great quarter led by continued strong success in the United States.", "The domestic trauma business grew 29% in the third quarter,28% of military sales are excluded. This represents the seventh consecutivequarter of greater than 20% in the U.S. market. All categories werestrong with Gamma3 hip fracture devices, T2 intramedullary nails, and VariAxDistal Radius the leading products.", "Despite being weighed down by Japanese price reductions,international trauma sales grew 8% in constant currency. Europe grew its traumabusiness at mid-teens levels operationally, Japan experienced mid to high single-digitlocal currency sales declined a solid volume gains will shoot up by anapproximate 14% price decrease.", "Trauma sales growth was around 30% operationally in theremaining international markets, led by Canada and Pacific.", "Now turning to spine, that was up 24% in dollars and 22%operationally in the quarter, our spine franchise obviously had a great quarterled by the U.S. business, which recorded its four straight quarter with growthover 20%. U.S.spine sales were up a robust 31%. Growth was pretty consistent across allproduct categories and was again led by Xia Thoracolumbar, interbody spacers,and our posterior and anterior surgical products. Outside the U.S., spinal growth was just 4% oflocal currency with interbody devices, the strongest selling product category.", "On an operational basis, specific in Canada have excellent quarters in spine, growingabove 20%, the results in Japan,which had mid single-digit growth in Europewhere sales declined slightly below our expectations.", "Now, turning to craniomaxillo facial products, this was up20% in dollars and 18% in local currency in the third quarter. CMF salescontinue their recent strong trend in the United States market growing 24% onthe quarter, their best rate quarter over 20% growth. U.S. sales performance was againled by neuro products and our HydroSet injectable bone substitute. Salesoutside the U.S. grew 4% onconstant currency, specific in Europe, theleading growth markets.", "Now, turning to MedSurg, they had an excellent quarter withaccelerate growth from all three product franchises and in both the domesticand international categories. MedSurg is comprised of three significant productcategories, instruments makes up 17% of company sales, endoscopy 14% andmedical 9% leading to the total 40% of our sales that come from MedSurg.", "MedSurg group sales were up 22% for the quarter in U.S.dollars and 20% in constant currency. Domestic growth picked up nicely forinstruments in medical on a sequential basis and international growth forinstruments and endoscopy demonstrate continued strength.", "And now looking at the businesses individually, sales forinstruments product line increased 22% in the third quarter as reported andwere up 20% in constant currency. Instruments had a great quarter, particularlyin the U.S.were sales growth came at 22 %.", "Domestic sales were again led by exceptional growth of heavyduty power tools, as well an excellent quarter in navigation. Neuro, spine andENT products also registered strong growth in the U.S.", "International sales of instrument products were up 16%operational with growth overseas led by neuro, spine and ENT product and heavyduty power tools.", "On a geographic basis the story was much the same as thesecond quarter with Pacific over 20% operational growth and Europeposting mid teens local currency growth.", "Now endoscopy, which was up 26% in the quarter as reported,and 24% in constant currency had a tremendous quarter, its best since lastyear\u2019s exceptionally strong fourth quarter. The U.S. posted a second straight 21%growth quarter paced by strong i-Suite and general surgery sales.", "International sales were up 35% in local currency, with allproduct categories exhibiting exceptional strength, in geographic growth led byEurope and the Pacific. And then last, butcertainly not least, within our MedSurg group our medical business was up 16%in the quarter as reported and 15% operationally.", "Medical put up another solid quarter with acceleratinggrowth on a sequential basis. U.S.sales growth was led by an excellent quarter from our stretcher products, andstrong EMS sales. International sales werevery strong in the Latin America and Pacificregions.", "Now, I'll make some comments on the remainder of the incomestatement. As expected, the gross margin percentage declined slightly comparedto the prior year. As discussed during the last call, our 2006 third quartergross margin benefited from reduced royalty costs attributable to royaltyagreement explorations. Year-to-date margins are up 40 basis points versus lastyear and remained in good shape to continue our trend of year-over-yearexpansion.", "Spending on research and development grew by 20% in thequarter and reached 6.7% of sales, their highest percentage levels since thefourth quarter of 2005. We continue to develop both internal and acquiredtechnologies and increased R&D spending across most of the businesses at avery healthy rate.", "SG&A costs increased 16% in the quarter, slightly lowerthan the growth rate in sales. Sales related costs accounted for the majorityof this increase. Selling costs include compensation and higher instrumentamortization costs on with continued overall investment in our sales forces.Operating income increased 22% in the quarter and operating margins increasedto 21.1% of sales.", "And now for a brief breakdown of our income expense for thequarter, the investment income came in at $23.2 million in the quarter that wasoffset by interest expense of $11.4 million and a foreign currency transactionloss of $1.2 million, bringing the overall other income in the quarter to $10.6million in the quarter. Interest expense was higher in the quarter as wereported the higher level of tax interest expense associated with our taxapproval balances.", "Company's effective income tax rates were 28.1% and 27.9%for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 respectively. The rate forthe first nine months of 2007 is impacted by higher than average rate on thetax benefit associated with the patent impairment charge recorded in the secondquarter.", "Now we\u2019ll take a quick look at the balance sheet, whichfinished September in very good shape. Accounts receivable days ended thequarter at 59 days, up one day compared to the prior quarter and consistentwith the prior year.", "Inventory days finished the quarter at 155 days, up six daysin the quarter, but down four days from the September 2006 level. Inventorydays are normally reached in a high water mark in our third quarter, given theslower orthopaedic implants surgery schedule in the quarter. We expect to seethese days measure decline markedly during the fourth quarter, as surgeryschedules falls back, and we continue with our normal second half slowdown inplant production pace.", "And as of September 30th, we do have $17 million of debtoutstanding, that's all classified as currents.", "And then just briefly on cash flow, we continue to have agreat cash flow for the year, with $661 million cash from operations in thefirst nine months, that's a 33% increase from last year's $497 million.", "So with that, I turn it back over to Steve.", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks Dean. With three quarters down 2007 is headingtowards the finish, even a little better than we planned at the outset of theyear. We are in great shape to deliver our seventh straight year ofdouble-digit sales growth. As it relates to fourth quarter, many of you willrecall that we are facing difficult year-over-year comparisons, given theexceptional growth achieved by several of our franchises in last year's fourthquarter.", "However, with a bit stronger than expected third quarter onthe Board, we have raised our sales guidance for the year and believe we willhit constant currency top line growth of 13% to 13.5%.", "On the bottom line, we continue to forecast 20% adjustedearnings growth, with $2.40 as the projected target for the year.", "We've also continued to invest in R&D and sales forceexpansions this year, while every project doesn't always develop exactly asplanned, we believe we benefit from broad approaches in these areas.", "Similarly, our business has been built as a unique footprintover time, with measured acquisitions and R&D investments. We would expectthis methodology to continue to serve us well, as we evaluate potential usesfor our growing cash balances.", "We'll now open it up for questions. We will hand it back toyou, Katrina.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from theline of Mike Weinstein representing JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Taylor Harris - JPMorgan", "Thanks a lot. Hey, it's actually Taylor Harris here forMike. So, my question is obviously the top line growth was very, very strongthis quarter, and perhaps surprisingly so, and not just MedSurg, but some ofthe orthopaedic businesses outside of hips and knees. So, just to focus ontrauma, spine, CMF, was there anything there that is surprising you this yearin terms of how strong those businesses are performing?", "And then secondly, I know you made a lot of sales forceinvestments in those areas, is any of the strength you think one time in naturethis year due to the sales force investments you are making?", "Steve MacMillan", "Taylor, I think if you lookat particular trauma and spine businesses, historically we probably beenunderdeveloped from a market share standpoint in the United States. And a few years agowe made a strategic commitment to really strengthen those businesses and it\u2019shappened through both the sales forces expansions, as well as frankly a muchstronger focus on R&D and just focused leadership. And the same frankly forour craniomaxillofacial business.", "And I think we are seeing the impact of the leaders thatwe\u2019ve put in place there and really having great impact and while we don\u2019texpect those numbers to continue, certainly trauma and spine at 30%. We thinkwe can be growing significantly faster than the market here still for manyquarters ahead, again we would not expect it to continue up close to 30, butcertainly can they be better than the market, we certainly think so.", "And candidly outside the U.S. we still have someopportunities. Our Spine business in Europewas pretty soft this quarter and so are always looking at the opportunitieswhere we can do better. But it is important to note that those businessescollectively will be well over a $1 billion this year and have probably beenkind of quietly overlooked in the aftermath of hips and knees they have becomessizeable and very profitable and high growth businesses for us and clearlyplaying a bigger part of our overall growth.", "Taylor Harris - JPMorgan", "Okay, great. And then one additional question. Youreferenced the tough comp you have in the fourth quarter. You are guiding, Ithink organically the growth of 10.5% to 12.5%, which is it\u2019s certainly lowerthan what you have done in the past two quarters. Is that really just acomparison issue or should we read anything into that as you look forward to2008 and what type of growth we should expect next year?", "Dean Bergy", "Purely a comparison issue, do not worry about a slowdown.Here is, as a remainder, the number is probably on closed deal, Last year inthe fourth quarter four of our five implant businesses grew 20% or greater.Knees, trauma, spin and CMF globally were all up over 20 and endo justabsolutely blew it our with 27% growth.", "Frankly, it looks like there is a lot capital that needed tobe spent probably in hospitals in the fourth quarter as we had launched the 1188. Last years fourth quarter was clearlya blow out and just as we are going up against that we continue to feel very,very good about the direction, but we just want to be candid in that.", "Taylor Harris - JPMorgan", "Sure. So as we think about 2008 should we expect performanceroughly inline with '07 other areas where you expect to do better or worse andthen I will drop.", "Steve MacMillan", "Well hips will better. I think what we'll give guidance for'08 in January. Let us finish this year first, but I would say on a high levelbasis what you should probably expect is, things like trauma and spin areprobably going to slow down a little bit. Hips will probably accelerate alittle bit.", "And all in hopefully, Japan won't be quite a drag, thatit has been this year, but it may not be a star next year and we'll give youguidance. But I would clearly -- we feel pretty good, there is alwayschallenges, we are always nervous, but we feel pretty good about what you willable to expect in '08.", "Taylor Harris - JPMorgan", "Great. Well congrats on a very good quarter.", "Steve MacMillan", "Great. Thanks, Taylor.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkinsrepresenting Lehman Brothers. Please proceed.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "", "Hi good afternoon, thanks for taking the call.", "Steve MacMillan", "Hi Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "", "Hey guys, just a couple of quick question here. First, Steveyou mentioned in your prepared comments that how did MedSurg above long-termexpected growth. I think we've probably asked this before, but would you tellus what you think expected growth rate is longer term for this group of businessesas you look out the next two or three years?", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure Bob. I think we continue to think about medical as alow teens growth business. If you look at the medical marketplace, candidlyit\u2019s probably a high single-digit growth market. But we continue to seeopportunities to grow at least a factor above that, that which puts us in tothe low double-digits.", "For instruments I think we think about that as roughly a midteens growth business. Again that market is probably growing in 10 to 12ish, butwe continue to kind of broaden our product line and move out.", "Plus again, as we remind you is, our both our endo andinstruments businesses have been under developed outside the U.S. and part ofthe sales force expansions have been investing in those businesses outside theU.S., which should allow instruments to grow really we think in the mid teenslevel.", "And endoscopy, longer terms we think of it as a mid to highteens growth businesses. So I think the 20% are typically going to be theoutliers, but we are going to throw a few twenties on the board from time totime, but I think those are probably the best longer term expectations.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "", "That\u2019s very helpful, now in the endo part mid to high teens,is that for you or for the market or both?", "Steve MacMillan", "That\u2019s for us. Again I we think we \u2013 we think we aresignificantly outgrowing the market and its probably marginally in the U.S. or modestly in the U.S. And again, significantopportunities outside the United States,again those two businesses endo and instruments had been focused really just onthe U.S.market for a long, long time and we are seeing that opportunity.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "", "Okay. And then on Japan,if pricing were flat, where would, and I am sure I could do this math, but ifyou have it, if pricing were flat this year where would have you have grown in Japan?", "Steve MacMillan", "Well, we're down about 7%, so off in pricing.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "In pricing.", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "So, what I mean that be. In other words, I am just trying toget a sense for once pricing anniversaries, what kind of growth out of Japan we canexpect?", "Steve MacMillan", "We will see where it plays out. Keep in mind, there is yetanother round of price cuts coming. This was sort of a biannual thing thatusually just hit any even numbers years. This year because they or the pastbiannual one because it was so draconian and they spread into three pieces overtwo years.", "So, unfortunately, we are going right back into another onenext, but we hope that it will not be as significant as what we've beenthrough. We also have been probably getting better about trying to get someproducts registered and some other things to ultimately do a better jobourselves in Japangoing forward.", "So, I don't think there is going to be a dramatic turnaroundbut we feel a little bit better about where we are heading, but there will bestill more price cuts on the horizon in a more likelihood.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "And then just really quickly on the spine, do you think youhave the critical mass to really take on the top three share players?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yes.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "Okay.", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah, we feel very good about where we are there.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "Great, thanks for your time.", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - LehmanBrothers", "Yeah.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Marc Mullikinrepresenting Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "Good afternoon.", "Dean Bergy", "Hi, Marc.", "Steve MacMillan", "Hi, Marc.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "Hey, just to start off on actually the bed's business, yousigned the agreement with Universal Hospital Services a few months ago, andjust wanted to find out how that agreement is structured and what sort ofimpact you would expect it to have?", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, I don't think we will give any details on how itstructured. We would tell you that overtime, we think it opens up a very niceplay into the rental market, where we've never historically played. We wouldalso tell you we are probably still in the top of the first inning in terms ofany real impact as that goes out. It's a new business for us. It's a little bitnew for them in terms of being partnered with us.", "We feel very good about all the initial feedback, but theimpact really hasn't yet been felt and we think that's one of the reasons thatwe will be able to grow our medical business again faster than the overallmarket, because we are entering a market that we are not in today.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "What portion of the bed's business is rental of the marketoverall?", "Steve MacMillan", "Mark, I don't think it\u2019s a big portion today. A lot of whatyou see in rentals really have to do with surfaces. This is a little bit of anew avenue. So I think we\u2019ll have to see how it develops. But we like ourrelationship and we think it will be a broad perspective to allow us along withUHS to talk about a broader offering to products with the ability to rentproducts as well as volumes.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "Okay, fair enough. And then on the hip resurfacing businessin Europe with the MITCH product, can you just give us an idea of what sort oftraction you are getting with that and maybe any lessons learned for the launchof format in the U.S.?", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure, where it is going, it's going reasonably well. I thinkthe challenge candidly and the differences in the U.S. were number two to market andwe come from a strong position. And mostly in the European and foreign markets,we've been sixth or seventh player and so it's doing okay for us. It's been anice round up, but probably hasn't had the impact that we would hope and expectthat it will in the U.S.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "Okay. And then just one final one and I\u2019ll hop off. It lookslike the instrument sales in the U.S. jumped quite a bitsequentially. I don't know if that's just artifact in my model or not, but ifthat's correct, is there anything a product launch or anything that's drivingthat?", "Dean Bergy", "System 6 heavy duty power tools are really driving thebusiness right now.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "And how long does that been out on the market?", "Dean Bergy", "We initially launched it in the third quarter of last year,but I would say it's really hitting its traction, it's kind of I would tail endthe third, it was probably September. It's really hitting our traction and wesee it usually hit the traction a few quarters after it's been out and I thinkthat's right the sweet spot that we just hit this last quarter.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "So you would expect it to continue for another couple ofquarters then?", "Dean Bergy", "Probably whether it's a quite that level, we never want toplan that is quite that level, 20% plus growth in our instruments business isclearly a little more stratospheric, but I think we do see it being healthycertainly coming forward here for a few quarters.", "Marc Mullikin - PiperJaffray", "Hey, very good. Thank you. Nice quarter.", "Dean Bergy", "Thanks Marc.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Tao Levyrepresenting Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Tao Levy - DeutscheBank", "Good afternoon.", "Steve MacMillan", "Hi Tao.", "Tao Levy - DeutscheBank", "Hey, two couple of quick questions, first maybe you couldshare about that on the U.S.side on the orthopaedic implants looks specially in knees you guys areperforming very well. Can you comment how you think you guys are doing relativeto the market growth and if you taking share who is most vulnerable out of yourcompetitors?", "Steve MacMillan", "We'll answer the first part, not to say this. The firstpart, I think we continue to be very pleased with Triathlon, particularly goingagainst multiple years now a very difficult comparables.", "And at a stage in the life cycle when typically a productwould have slowed much more significantly than where we are and I think thatspeaks to the overall traction in interest that Triathlon has had.", "So, I think again, we preferred just to really talk aboutprobably how we are doing relative to the market. We know there has been a lotof buzz and a lot of talk about a lot of other knee systems, but we continue tofeel very, very good about Triathlon.", "Tao Levy - DeutscheBank", "You can get that share in that in the quarter?", "Steve MacMillan", "Probably not much. I think we probably grew ever so modestlyfaster than the market, as we have here, I think for a number of quarters, butits just on the margin.", "Tao Levy - DeutscheBank", "Got you, okay. And maybe you could comment a bit on thepipeline product, is that, I recall that\u2019s supposed to be a Q4 launch, if wascorrect and what are the expectations that we should be thinking about forthat?", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. We are still working through some finalcommercialization issues on that and it may or may not be fourth quarter, I'dsay candidly its probably going to shift in to next year, and the great part isthat business is strong enough, healthy enough that we have the patience.", "I think the key here is because we are going in to a newmarket we want to make sure, and we are going against a very formidablecompetitor, we want to make sure that we really had everything buttoned up froma complete manufacturing, product execution, as well as the customer trials andfrankly have the sales force and everything geared up.", "And I think in all likelihood it's probably shifting lateenough end of the year, that will probably move in to next year to be moreeffective.", "Tao Levy - DeutscheBank", "So like a second quarter '08?", "Steve MacMillan", "Probably a reasonably, we are still sorting out, that\u2019sprobably a fair.", "Dean Bergy", "Yes, I think sometime in the first half is fair.", "Tao Levy - DeutscheBank", "Okay. And then for Dean, in the third quarter you talkedabout the interest expense that you had on, I guess you tax accrual. Is thatsomething that\u2019s going to continue going forward or do you pay that down, youjust every quarter other line have been progressing increasing, this quarter itsdown about $6 million. I am just trying to think going forward you obviouslyhave a larger cash balance, how should we be modeling that?", "Dean Bergy", "Yes, again it does relate to our tax reserves and itprobably was a little heavier this quarter than I would anticipated being, butit is a more specific calculation than it used to be under the new accountingsrules that we adapted at the outset of the year under the FIN 48 pronouncement.So, its probably going to be more volatile than its been in the past, but Iwould expect that this quarter is probably a little heavier on the margin inthat category, than you might normally see.", "Tao Levy - DeutscheBank", "Great. Thanks a lot. Good quarter.", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks Tao.", "Operator", "The next question comes from line of Raj Denhoy representingBear Sterns. Please proceed.", "Raj Denhoy - BearSterns", "Good evening, guys.", "Steve MacMillan", "Hey, Raj.", "Dean Bergy", "Hi, Raj.", "Raj Denhoy - BearSterns", "I wonder if I could ask little bit on the strategy behindthe spending. You guys put up a really good quarter again, on the top-line. Andyou increased spending sort of across the board in selling and marketing aswell R&D, and your returned just 20% again on the bottom, which I say just(inaudible).", "Steve MacMillan", "Just 20, come on.", "Raj Denhoy - BearSterns", "Where I get, when it comes right down to it, if you guyskeep doing this well on the top-line we come a point where, you start allowingmore to fall through in the sense, because you are really not to get out of thepark in the top-line here?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah, Raj, our goal is to keep this going for as long ashumanly possible. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is, we continue to find moreideas on the R&D front to be able to spend and little pockets of sales forceshere and there. And when times are good, I think we want to continue fuel this,so that we've got more and more things to carry us into '08, carry us into '09in the 2010. And so, I probably would expect more of it to continue to bereinvested, given that we've already set such an aggressive earnings goal. Ithink relative to most same companies. And we\u2019re thinking about just trying tokeep it going for as long as possible.", "Raj Denhoy - BearSterns", "Fair enough. Then if I could just ask one on the resurfacingside. You mentioned your training surgeons this quarter, is there any matrixyou can give us around that, how many surgeons you have trained and if we canexpect these guys to start ordering implants here in the fourth quarter?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah, the numbers so far are very small, and we tend to notgive specific numbers. But I\u2019d remind you that the product was cleared in July,by the time we got our final labeling and all of that and then prepared to dothe sales training, it really didn\u2019t start until the end of August. And we\u2019redoing a lot of fairly detailed training so that, it was almost insignificant inthe quarter. I think here over the fourth quarter we will certainly start tosee a little bit more.", "And, Raj if I go back to just elaborate on your previousquestion too. Again, what we probably remind is this healthier than usual topline growth that you are seeing right now is really the reflect of some of theadditional investments we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years. Again, well, timeswere good so that we could keep investing and that\u2019s what our hope really ishere.", "Raj Denhoy - BearSterns", "Right, well, fair enough it does seem to be working. I guessjust lastly another kind of product question on MedSurg, when I think whatthings are sort of distinguishes you guys is your very broad offering in thatsegment and we are hearing some rumblings in hospitals signing exclusivecontracts and things that you guys sort of outfit hospitals and in those sortof things. Is there anything to that, the fact that you guys are able to offersuch a broad product sweep and so that\u2019s allowing you kind of really outpacethe market here?", "Steve MacMillan", "We think that is a key part of our success. I mean it\u2019sstart\u2019s product by product but when you collectively put together our variousbusinesses we do think it\u2019s helping us.", "Raj Denhoy - BearSterns", "Great, fair enough, thanks.", "Steve MacMillan", "Great. Thanks Raj.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jason Wittesrepresenting Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Jason Wittes - LeerinkSwann", "Hi, thank you very much.", "Steve MacMillan", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "Just wondering first of the general question, I know we allyou gave the general impressions on pricing for the reason that I know wealways pick on hips and knees, but clearly your are coming out as morediversified company especially this quarter. Can you give us an indication ofwere pricing actually be strong quickly in your implant business and yourMedSurg business. I'd love to get sort of landscape in terms of where you thinkyou have some decent pricing and all that stuff?", "Steve MacMillan", "Jason, it's really not that distinguished, it's in areasonably tight range. So I don't -- obviously we wanted to be a little morecircumspect with our comments on pricing and I think it's in a tight enoughrace that it's not even really fair to distinguish.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "So, I mean, are you implying that there is not a bigdifference between the hip and knee business and say spine or trauma businessat this point?", "Steve MacMillan", "Not a real significance. Obviously, the one thing that we docall out is Japanand that's the one area where we are seeing significant price decline, as youall know, but the rest of our businesses are in a reasonably tight ranges.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "Okay. I guess I won't push further on that, but I guess youimplied that you think you have enough critical mass to go after the spinemarket in a big way and certainly that seems to be the case looking at thenumbers. For trauma, it's been the last couple of quarters you really took off,and is that also a situation of critical mass, or is it largely because youhired, I would say quite a few sales people about a year ago and they arestarting to finally pay the dividend?", "Steve MacMillan", "Its pieces above, I think we really had six great quartersover 20% now.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "That's right. I'll correct myself.", "Steve MacMillan", "Over the last two, we had a couple of 30 there, so you arein good [shape]. I think it's seven straight quarters right at 20. I think weprobably moved into the number two position we think in the U.S.marketplace and have a pretty good offering and yet we still have some gaps inour product line that we are working to fill here in the coming years.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "Okay.", "Steve MacMillan", "So I think we feel good both about where we are come fromand still feel like there is one way ahead of us.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "In terms R&D, can we assume that the focus of yourR&D projects over the next year are certainly need to be still in thoseareas that are really growing fast right now, spine, trauma, and (inaudible),is that the way we should think about the focus or?", "Steve MacMillan", "It's everywhere. It's all going to be in hips and additionalthings in knees and across our endo and instruments businesses. We really arereinvesting in everyone of our franchises right now. And again we remind peopleconstantly that a lot of our success is build on singles, not home runs and alot of this is just quietly introducing another product, whether it's acervical plate in spine or different spacer for the interbody space or a handplate, a Distal Radius plate for example and trauma.", "One of these things are, this incredible breakthrough that'sworth highlighting, but collectively across the business, they really add upand they start to load the basis and constantly bring some runs in for us.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "Okay. And in terms of next year, I guess for more guidancewe're going to wait till January, but I suppose we can assume that you arestill sticking to the 20% role on the bottom line?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yes, I think it's probably a reasonable assumption.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Steve MacMillan", "Great, thanks Jason.", "Jason Wittes -Leerink Swann", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch representing BMOCapital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMOCapital Markets", "I am still lost again the 20% being reasonable.", "Steve MacMillan", "Thank you, Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMOCapital Markets", "Anyway, your spine business in the U.S is quite strong andoutside United Statesin the single digits. What do you need to do to get your OUS business sort ofpumped up?", "Steve MacMillan", "Get better. It's I think greater focus and we've been, weprobably shifted the balance a little bit towards the U.S. and I think it'sbeen a little bit quicker to launch products in the U.S. Candidly, we probablyhave some opportunities to strengthen our sales team dedicated to spine,particularly outside the U.S.", "I think we still had not as dedicated resources in outsidethe U.S. in lot of cases the spine people being carrying some other productsand we're probably where we're in the U.S. several years ago when we Recon peopleand spine, Recon and spine under the same rep. And so, there is probably someopportunities there to do what we do pretty well which is better focused.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay. So, it's fair to say we should see U.S. salesgrowth temper close to the markets, mid-teens growth rate and OUS growth may bestrengthened over the next period?", "Steve MacMillan", "Probably though, I would say international may take a littlebit of time. I wouldn't expect that in the fourth quarter. I also wouldn'texpect us to revert to the mean to the market in the U.S. quite as quickly either.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay. And someone has asked, how are you feeling aboutacquisitions these days?", "Steve MacMillan", "We continue to be looking and frankly since Katherine hasjoined us, she is surfacing a lot of good ideas, and I would tell you we'vebeen fairly active poking around and yet we're in such a position of strengththat we feel very patient and comfortable not to overpay.", "We still think there is a lot assets out on the market thatcandidly are premium priced or priced to perfection at this point in time. Andwe are going to buy out our time and still look at to broaden our footprintovertime and we will see where it plays out. But we don't feel any burningurgency to have to deal with deal this year or whenever.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay. And the last, when might we see some clinical data onyour artificial disc program?", "Steve MacMillan", "On the artificial disc, we have filed the FlexiCore, thelumbar disk. So that is\u2026", "Joanne Wuensch - BMOCapital Markets", "And probably cervical, sorry.", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah, the cervical, we are close to wrapping up that study.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMOCapital Markets", "Okay.", "Steve MacMillan", "And that hopefully the enrollment on that certainly shouldbe completed this quarter. So then we\u2019ll be in a position start to analyze.That was also the two year follow-up as you well know.

Most of my questions havebeen taken, but I just wanted to ask, now that we are closer to the 2008, if youmight be willing to give us any sort of progress on your OP-1 product?", "Steve MacMillan", "I think what we continue to say with this Brian is justtaking out your models. It may be quite a while. And as we\u2019ve given that mostof what we have said over the last 10 years is probably not been -- probablybeen rosier than what we expected.

And we don\u2019t mind building up the cash position at this point to beready to pounce when the time comes, but obviously, if that would have continueto build we'll certainly be thinking about possibly both dividend, buybackthose kinds of things.", "Brian Wong -Broadpoint Capital", "Okay. And then given the fact that you guys have settledwith the department of justice on the hip and knees side, I was wondering ifyou would heard any rumblings in terms of the similar source of investigationson spine across the industry?", "Steve MacMillan", "Not that I am aware of.", "Dean Bergy", "No", "Brian Wong -Broadpoint Capital", "Okay, fair enough.", "Steve MacMillan", "We know there was one a few years back with one of the othercompanies.", "Brian Wong -Broadpoint Capital", "Right.", "Steve MacMillan", "But have not heard, we are not aware of anything now.", "Brian Wong -Broadpoint Capital", "Okay.

Please proceed.", "Michael Matson -Wachovia", "", "Hi thanks for taking my question. It looks like you hadobviously really strong growth in your more capital intensive part of yourbusiness. I am just wondering given what we've seen in the credit market overthe summer, the late summer here, if there is any risk that hospitals may havea more difficult time in financing their capital budgets over the next 6 to 12months?", "Steve MacMillan", "We've asked ourselves a question Mike and frankly we thinkthat our stuff is enough under the radar screen that lot of our stuff is as youknow smaller relative to major, major expansion. And we think we are inreasonable shape there, but it\u2019s a great question one that we've been kind of wonderinga little bit ourselves, but we think that the fundamentals of our MedSurgbusinesses are still in good shape.", "Michael Matson -Wachovia", "Okay. And then just in your spine business, I was wonderingif you've seen any kind of an impact from or if you are concerned about anykind of impact from Medtronic's cervical disk products, because it seems likethey have \u2013 the numbers they put out for their training program seem prettyaggressive, it seems like they've trained a lot of surgeons in a short amountof time and there may be some risk of cannibalizing some of the cervicalproducts?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah. They are obviously the 800 pound gorilla in this spaceand a company we have tremendous admiration and respect for in the spinal role.I think we still see enough opportunities. We are obviously little concerned byit and I think its probably why our, we are probably not going to be posting abunch more 30% growth quarters. But I think we continue to feel good about ourunderlying strength and where we are going with our own portfolio, to be ableto grow at greater than market rates.", "Michael Matson -Wachovia", "All right. And then in the knee area are there any plans topursue an approval for a mobile bearing knee. And then just any updates onwhere are the reclasiification of mobile bearing knee stands at this point?", "Dean Bergy", "Mike, we do have a trial that\u2019s underway with our mobilebearing knee, it's actually our mobile bearing knee which is called a ScorpioPlus, does extremely well overseas and we have a trail that\u2019s underway in the U.S.So we are not completely enrolled at this point in time.", "Relative to down classification, I haven\u2019t heard anythingmore recently and I think we are assuming that may not happen, so we are goingto continue along the path that we have been on. But, obviously there isreasonable follow-up here so reasonable it will be some reasonable period oftime before we would have that product on the market in the U.S.", "Steve MacMillan", "And we also don\u2019t feel a need to have every offering thatevery competitor has.

You talked about improving your growthand penetration trend on overseas in Europe and Japan.", "Can you give us an idea, may be what has been the dynamicsthere, what you changed, if anything, and over the long run, is there anything,what's the penetration look like, is there anything different about that marketthat, what kind of legs does that have? No pun intended?", "Steve MacMillan", "Probably nothing dramatic Matt, I think to be candid wethink the international markets probably were little healthier this quarter andI am not sure we did anything really and we are seeing some uptick certainlyfrom Triathlon as people shift over. We've also got a lot of very loyal Scorpiousers.", "Dean Bergy", "I think just as a point of clarification, the product is notapproved in Japan.So, the main results in Japanare coming Scorpio energy product.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Got it.", "Steve MacMillan", "So, I think its -- but I think we will continue to seecertainly uptick from Triathlon, more surgeons would see it, the acceptance iscertainly very good. But I wouldn't say we did anything magical this quarter byany stretch.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "So, in terms of your innings analysis, I mean where are youin terms of innings in Europe and then does this get approved and when in Japan?", "Steve MacMillan", "Obviously, the product has been well received in the marketwhere it's launched, but I think we're still probably in earlier innings inEurope Matt. In Japan,I think we would certainly see approval there although.", "The energy product, which was designed specifically for theJapanese market and the Japanese anatomy, is doing very, very there. So, Ithink we're very comfortable with our offering in the market today.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Okay. And just on Japan, follow-up to some of the questionsearlier on pricing, did you mention what exactly the cuts going to be, is itcome again in January, or does it come again in April and we just don't know?", "Steve MacMillan", "We think it will be in April, but we don't know who they areyet. They have not been resolved yet and that's really a lot of chewing andthrowing that will happen over the next few months.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Okay. And if I remember correctly, if this is the typicalbiannual cycle, it's like we start to hear noises in like January, February andMay be a final number at the end of February and March something like that?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yes, and so it usually kicks in April 1st.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Got it. A follow-up on spine, you talked about havingcritical mass and it's certainly looks like the investments in the line and everythingelse is paying off. Is there anything in particular that's really stands out,that's driving the business, and then maybe also is there anything in your bagof products in spine, that you feel like you don't have gap that seem like youdon't have much, the way you are performing, but what else do you think youneed to have a full bag in spine?", "Steve MacMillan", "I think we are there now. I think it's really what's drivingthe growth. When you think about what's happened in spine, again we've gone fromfour years ago having a spine division is essentially sold alongside our Reconfolks. We have some dedicated spine reps.", "We had some multi-baggers and we basically had athoracolumbar business. And so a lot of our success over the last few years hadbeen dedicated sales people. And then filling out the line and I think thereare now a lot more spine surgeons who feel comfortable being able to walk intothe OR, knowing that Stryker can serve all of their needs and instead of justbeing a specialist, therefore just a scoliosis surgery.", "So now as we have gotten much more of a cervical line, muchmore of an interbody line, we've put ourselves I think in a much betterposition and there are no gaping holes. There are still products improvementsand ideas obviously ultimately the disks will be there, but most of the holeswe feel we've done a pretty good job of filling or have plans to continue tofill in and round it up. But I call it now there is no gaping holes, now it's amatter of icing on the cake.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Okay. So waiting for sort of the total disk replacementsmotion, dynamic stabilization might be another area that we could expectsomething from you?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yeah, that will be one of the obvious ones. Again that's anarea that was incredibly hyped a couple of years ago. It's there and it'll bewill certainly and should be there with a lot of other folks.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "I have been waiting for this for a while, but do you thinkwe'll see anything new in that area at last, are you going to keep us waitinguntil the very last minute?", "Steve MacMillan", "Probably not much this year, I wouldn't expect anything frommuch this year.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Okay, that's good to know. Just couple of follow-ups onhips, you talked about the resurfacing having an impact sometime next year. Inbetween, now and then, do we get domestic hip growth up to market, or is thathappened in concert with resurfacing like second quarter say next year?", "Steve MacMillan", "Probably it happens in conjunction with resurfacing. But welike it to happen a little faster. Yes, will it actually happen, I wouldn'tcommit to it until we have resurfacing.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Okay, fair enough. And then on trauma just last question,you obviously doing great there as everyone has noted and it's an area where Ithink we have a industry meeting this weekend. A similar question to spine, Imean is there any place there that we can expect a new push in products or gapthat you are filling or is it just you feel its like execution, you are justgoing to keep hitting with the bag you have got?", "Steve MacMillan", "Well its going to be a lot like spine, which is continuingto introducing singles in terms of product lines and continuing to fill out thebag, to also be able to serve the trauma surgeon as we are now serving thespine surgeon, which is them having the confidence that they can go in to anytrauma case. And we have the products there for them. And we are close to beingin that situation, but I wouldn\u2019t say we are a 100% there yet.", "Matt Miksic - MorganStanley", "Okay.

Please proceed.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just, about two of theMedSurg markets. I had a question about trauma. We've actually countedprocedures where we actually blend in kind of codes. And there has beenvirtually no unit growth for the last five or six years across the states wemeasured.", "Could you explain, is there enough mix shift left in thatcategory to keep the underlying market growing at 10%? And the second questionI have is about the instrument business. It would seem to be fundamentally areplacement business where you have never won market share, is it just sodominated by surgeon preference that you come up with a better drill or otherpower tool and the surgeon has the wherewithal to basically purchase off,basically guarantee mix up shift every year? Thanks a lot.", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure. I want to take the second one first, I think thesurgeon still is very critical in the instruments precision. Now these are the productsthat are in their hands, while they are cutting into people and everything elseand it really does matter, they are the ones who need to make those decisions.", "On the trauma side, I think we continue to see some mix,opportunity is clearly with introduction of lot compression place and all thatstuff over the last few years, probably drove it, that mix piece higher thanmaybe long-term sustainable growth rate. So, we might be even thinking about itas certainly high single-digits maybe right around 10. But that\u2019s probablywhere our general thinking is.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Thanks so much.", "Dean Bergy", "Yeah, Bru, if I could add just a little bit to that. Ontrauma, I would that, at least relative to the mix up shift and unlike plentywe haven\u2019t a lot of that in our business specifically, because it is not goingto be a -- as bigger part of our offering.", "And then on instruments just one follow-up point there, Iwould remind you that a reasonable proportion of that business is a disposablebusiness that\u2019s blades and attachments that go on to the capital equipment thatsome its used in the procedures everyday. So, that part of the business isreally based on procedural growth and is very repeatable.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "So in terms of the disposable component, what is the unitgrowth? The underlying surgical unit growth, is it the mid single-digit?", "Dean Bergy", "Its very comparable to what you are seeing in hip and kneesurgeries because its primarily used there and in other procedures.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Thanks a lot.", "Steve MacMillan", "You are welcome. Thanks, Bruce. Yet a few more, it lookslike Katrina?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. Your next question will come from the line of JeffJohnson representing Robert W. Baird.

Couple of things here,MHLW reps what, two weeks ago seem to be stepping up the radar a little bit onpricing in Japan next year in that. Do you have any feeling that those commentswere directed specifically at orthopaedics and other parts of devices? I guessthat\u2019s the first part of the question.", "Then second, any insight into, are these price cutssomething that are just going to continue to go on over the next decade, orthey are going to continue to reduce the overall percentages at lower pricemarkets for the market basket or, is it something where we finally could reachan end at some point in a year, in two years, in three years?", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure Jeff. Regarding their comments I think they are directedmore broadly at all medical device companies. And regarding the price cuts, Ithink we are assuming for our strategic planning purposes that they pretty wellgo on in perpetuity. And we'd hope that it will be just another year or two,but I wouldn\u2019t plan on it.", "Jeff Johnson - RobertW. Baird", "So, they just always find a way to meet those percentagesdown or add more countries to the market, basket or something?", "Steve MacMillan", "We think they do and frankly we continue to feel that theyare not really dealing with some of the underlying issues in their healthcaresystem. For example, the average sick patient is spending 20 to 25 days in thehospital.", "Jeff Johnson - RobertW. Baird", "Right.", "Steve MacMillan", "Whereas as in the U.S. that\u2019s two to three days, butthere are certain parts of their healthcare system they are not yet wrestlingwith the fundamental realities. There\u2019s only so much we are going to be able tochange that. We certainly are trying as an industry and, but I can\u2019t promisethat we\u2019ve got nail and having corrected quite as well as we like to yet.", "Jeff Johnson - RobertW. Baird", "All right thanks. And then just qualitatively I guess, onvolumes for large joints in the U.S.hips and knees specifically. Obviously, some questions on where volumes were in\u201906 and it seems like in the early part of \u201907 you were talking about volumesseem to have picked up. Do we still see volume trends stable or improving inthe U.S.this year?", "Steve MacMillan", "I think modestly.", "Jeff Johnson - RobertW. Baird", "Yeah.", "Steve MacMillan", "Nothing breakthrough, but seems to be a reasonable year.", "Jeff Johnson - RobertW. Baird", "Okay, great. And last question just on spine with the[exploit] product over in Europe, is there any opportunity to bring somethinglike that in the U.S.,is that kind of stay European product?", "Steve MacMillan", "Jeff, I can't comment specifically on that, it's obviouslyvery, very new to Europe and something we're exploring, no comment on what itmight look like in the U.S.at this point.", "Jeff Johnson - RobertW.

First, just in termsof the level of investment, obviously you mentioned continuing to plow back,but is it fair to say that the level of investment on the SG&A and R&Dside may be a little wider here looking forward than it has been over lastcouple in that, so we think about the P&L, the leverage will be more thereand may be on the gross margin side a little flatter in terms of that leverage?", "Steve MacMillan", "Great observation, yes I think that's how we probably seeit.", "Steven Lichtman -Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay, great. And then in terms of the couple of acquisitionsyou made in MedSurg to turn a consistent level of consciousness, I mean wouldyou characterize those as single opportunities and will they begin tocontribute next year, just trying to get a scale for those acquisitions?", "Steve MacMillan", "Yes, they are again singles and I think the tourniquet probablybe a little bit more meaningful next year than necessary level ofconsciousness. I think we think the level of consciousness monitor will be aslightly longer ramp, but I think it's those kind of things that probablyallows us to have our instruments business growing a couple of points fasterthan the market, and again probably get us into that mid-teens range instead ofcall it 8 to 12ish or whatever that the market might be growing.", "Steven Lichtman -Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Okay, great. And then last one Dean on the tax rate, is thisa good tax rate to use for the fourth quarter, do we see a still downward biasmaybe into next year?", "Dean Bergy", "I think we would see downward bias for the longer term, butprobably it is fair to say at this point in time in the year, the rate will bevery close to where it is year-to-date at 28.1.", "Steven Lichtman -Banc of AmericaSecurities", "Fair enough. Thanks guys.", "Dean Bergy", "Great, thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Larry Keuschrepresenting Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Larry Keusch - GoldmanSachs", "Hey guys.", "Steve MacMillan", "", "Hi, Larry.", "Larry Keusch -Goldman Sachs", "Just want to ask one sort of big picture question, and thisis sort of thinking over the next several years. This industry obviously hasbeen characterized a lot a by service levels among sales organizations andclose ties to physicians and who's going to get up in the middle of the nightto deliver the product et cetera.", "But I want to explore a little bit about how you guys arethinking about the importance of innovation. And what makes this challenging isobviously the long timelines that physicians major outcomes in this space, I amtalking primary large joint Recon.", "So maybe you could just talk a little bit about howimportant innovation in that space is going to be over the next several years,and just an update on how you are thinking about whether we are going torevisit types of cost reduction modalities, maybe not gain sharingspecifically, but where is that ultimately going to, to go to that resurface aswell?", "Steve MacMillan", "Sure Larry, I think we continue to see the service componentas a very important part of this business and really ultimately, we think thekey to success is a combination of clinically relevant innovation and greatservice levels.", "There will be innovations and as you know with us, we arenot always going to be first with the innovations and orthopaedic surgery,particularly total joints are very successful. So, we are trying to do is to becareful that anything we bring really is enhancing the surgical experience andthe patient experience.", "But I think there will continue to be opportunity foradditional innovation as we get better design, better materials. But there isalso going to be candidly probably some marketing stuff out there and, we probablywon't be on the leading edge of that kind of stuff. But again, its going to bea combination of both service and innovation and we think we\u2019re pretty wellpoised to cross all of our businesses to deliver against that model.", "Regarding pricing, we just assume its going to be long-termpricing pressure. The unit growth is going to be there. There will be pricingpressures, certain meaningful innovations. We will probably continue to be ableto garner mix upgrades and some of that.", "Larry Keusch - GoldmanSachs", "Okay. That\u2019s terrific. Thanks very much guys.", "Steve MacMillan", "Great, thanks Larry. And I think that wrapped it up therefor questions, Katrina?", "Operator", "Yes, sir.", "Steve MacMillan", "All right, we will just make a couple of final comments. Ourconference call for our fourth quarter 2007 operating results will be held onJanuary 23rd, 2008. And at that point, we will discuss our outlook for 2008sales and earnings.", "We also wanted to make you aware that we are planning achange of timing and venue for our annual analyst meeting, which istraditionally being held in conjunction with the American Academyof Orthopaedic Surgeons meeting. We now plan to hold our 2008 analyst meetingon May 8, in New York City,and hope that you will be able to join us at that time.", "And again, we feel good about where we are and we are very,very focused on delivering a solid fourth quarter and wrapping up the year andmoving into 2008.

My name is Denise and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. Before we begin, the company would like everyone to know that certain statements made in today's conference call may constitute forward-looking statements. They will be based upon management's current expectations and will be subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.", "In addition to factors that may be discussed in this call, such factors include, but are not limited to: pricing pressures generally, including cost-containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the company's products; regulatory actions; unanticipated issues arising in connection with the clinical studies and otherwise that affect the United States Food and Drug Administration approval of new products; changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payors; a significant increase in product liability claims; change in economic conditions that adversely affect the level of demand for the company's products; changes in foreign exchange markets; change in financial markets; and changes in the competitive environment.", "Additional information concerning these and other factors are contained in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "I will now turn the call over to your host for today's call, Mr. Stephen MacMillan, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please proceed sir.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Denise. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's first quarter 2008 earnings report. With me today are Dean Bergy, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations.", "Despite a few challenges, our results in the quarter once again demonstrate the overall strength of our business and our people, as we delivered our 29th consecutive quarter of double-digit sales gains, and once again delivered 20% earnings growth. Specifically, sales grew almost 15% as reported and up 10.3% operationally to $1.63 billion and net earnings from continuing operations grew a strong 20% in the quarter despite significant investments in quality and compliance initiatives. And we also delivered these results with an even slightly higher tax rate than planned.", "When you step back and look at the current global environment, we think these results stack up pretty well. Simply put, our unique footprint and broad areas of strength once again allowed us to absorb a few body blows, underscoring our ability to deliver in the face of challenges. While hips were disappointing in the quarter, knees were solid. And once again, spine, trauma, and CMF generated growth rates well above their markets, while our dependable MedSurg businesses, Instruments, Endoscopy, and Medical all posted double-digit operational sales growth in the US and globally.", "Against a backdrop of concerns about slowdowns in hospital capital expenditures, our MedSurg businesses again posted very healthy 16% growth in the US and this was following very strong results in the previous quarter. This quarter's results really follow the same pattern of the last few years, as strong above-market growth in Spine, Trauma, CMF, Instruments, Endoscopy, and Medical more than made up for slower reconstructive growth. Make no mistake about it though we do look forward to having our hip business join the other high performing franchises, and we will be looking for improvement in the coming quarters.", "At this point, we would also like to give you an update on our quality and compliance initiatives. In a nutshell, we are currently making major investments of money and people to upgrade and harmonize our quality and compliance systems across the company. In simple terms, we\u2019ve embarked on the journey from decentralized plants with different QA systems to a system with more common standards and greater consistency. This is clearly what FDA expects, and frankly it will make us an even better company. This journey will take time, but we are fortunate to have both the financial strength and organizational commitment to make these investments now. We are mobilized and we are on it.", "As Dean will discuss in more detail in a moment, the financial results were again strong, sales, profits, and cash flow were all very healthy, which also allowed us to announce a share buyback authorization in the quarter. While we have not yet initiated this, we see our ability to sustain our growth going forward linked to continued strong operational performance, while also using our cash for prudent acquisitions and modest buybacks to offset dilution.", "I will now turn it over to Dean for more details, but before I do we wanted to remind everyone that we will hold our 2008 Analyst meeting on May 8th in New York City, which is only a few weeks away. With that Dean.", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Steve. First we will take a look at the impact of foreign currency in our top line. As anticipated foreign currency was again very favorable this quarter. Weakening of the US dollar added $62 million to international sales and increased the company's overall sales growth by 4.3%. In the first quarter, the dollar weakened about 15% against the euro at approximately 12% against the yen compared to the prior year.", "The currency rates hold near March 31st levels, we expect the impact of foreign currency will increase second quarter 2008 sales by about 4.5% to 5.0% when compared to the prior year. And now turning to a brief analysis of our price volume impacts on the quarter, price actually added one point to sales growth as rounded up, FX as I said impacted sales favorably by 4% and volume mix was up 10% for the 15% growth that we reported. Selling prices were up slightly on a worldwide basis in the quarter with the exception of Japan where pricing continues to be impacted by reimbursement cuts.", "Japanese pricing was up 3% in the quarter as a result of the April 1st, 2007 MHLW reimbursement cuts. We expect the April 1st, 2008 MHLW price reductions to unfavorably impact our Japanese price by about 5% to 6% as we look to the remaining three quarters of 2008. Volume mix growth as I said was 10% in the first quarter. Domestic volume mix growth was 12% in the quarter while international volume mix growth came in at 5%.", "Now turning to our business segments, Orthopaedic Implants represents 59% of our sales and the sales of those products increased 12% in the first quarter. On a recorded basis, it\u2019s 7% operationally. The Orthopaedic Implant businesses were slightly impacted by one less comparative selling day in the international markets and the fact that Easter fell on the first quarter in 2008 compared to the second quarter last year.", "As we said last quarter, we would encourage a balanced long-term perspective on evaluating market growth in these categories where we expected to see continued favorable demographics. The sales growth rates by product line are included in our press release and I will reference those rates as I provide more detailed on our performance in each product category.", "So, turning to hips, they were up 4% in dollars and down 1% in constant currency in the first quarter. Our overall hip business in the quarter was negatively impacted by the Trident cup recall that we announced in January. Sales of hips were 2% in the United States. Domestic sales growth was flat by incremental Cormet Hip Resurfacing sales and growth in the Accolade cementless, X3 polyethylene, and Restoration Modular Revision Hip products. These gains were largely offset by significant declines in the Trident-related products. European hip sales declined mid single-digit levels on an operational basis. Exeter, Accolade, X3 polyethylene and our resurfacing hip, all did well but could not offset the decline in Trident sales. Japanese constant currency hip sales growth checked in at mid-single digits, a pleasant uptick from this businesses\u2019 performance in 2007. Adjustment for price reductions for hips, volumes gains were even higher with our Secur-Fit products leading the way. Local currency hip sales in the remaining international markets were off about 10% with the Trident recall having a significant impact.", "Turning to knees. They were up 14% in dollars and 9% in local currency in this quarter. Overall knee business was solid in the first quarter. US knee sales were up 12%, a 32nd straight quarter of domestic double-digit knee growth. Primary knees grew a low double-digit levels led by Triathlon and X3 polyethylene. Revision knee growth was over 30% as our new Triathlon TS revision product got off to a strong start. European constant currency in knee sales grew low single-digit levels paced by Triathlon.", "In Japan, our Knee business registered mid-teens operational growth. Our Scorpio NRG product continues to lead the way here. Pacific also posted mid-teens local currency knee growth with Triathlon starting to emerge in these markets. The knee growth in the remaining international markets is basically flat. Trauma was up 24% in dollars and 16% on an operational basis in the first quarter. Our trauma business had an extremely strong all-around quarter. US trauma sales were up 23% in the quarter and this growth is unchanged when military sales are excluded. This represents the ninth straight quarter of US trauma growth over 20%. All product categories provided nice growth with Gamma 3 Hip Fracture, VariAx Distal Radius, and Hoffman II External Fixation devices leading the way.", "International operational Trauma sales growth was 11%, the first time double-digits for the international contingents as to the first quarter of 2006. Europe was a standout with high teens constant currency growth and Canada was also extremely strong in a much smaller base. In Japan, local currency sales were up just slightly but grew at mid-to-high single-digits on a volume basis. Upper extremity products led our international Trauma growth.", "Spine was up 22% in dollars and 18% in local currency in the quarter. The Spine business had a very strong quarter with the US paving the way to this 18% operational growth. Domestic Spine sales grew 25% in the first quarter or 6th consecutive quarter over 20% growth. All product categories grew at 20% or above in the US with inter body and thoracolumbar devices at the top of the heel.", "International Spine sales were up just 2% operationally while going against the tough comparable from the prior year, which is up 18%. The major international markets opposed to local currency Spine growth and a reasonably tight range from low to middle single-digits. And then last, but sorry not least our CMF business was up 25% in dollars and 21% in local currency in the quarter. Our CMF business had an exceptional quarter in the U.S. posting 30% sales growth, strong sales of our Hydroset injectable bone substitute along the neuro products. Sales outside the US grew 5% operationally with neuro products posting the strongest growth in these markets.", "Now I will touch on our MedSurg group. This represents 41% of sales. MedSurg had a very good quarter. Instruments and Medical had nice quarters in the U.S. and Endoscopy was stronger in the international arena. MedSurg is comprised of three significant product categories, Instruments, which represents 18% of company sales; Endoscopy, which represents 14% of total company sales; and then our Medical business, which represents 9% of total company sales. MedSurg group sales were up 18% for the quarter in US dollars and 15% at an operational basis.", "And then turning to the businesses, sales for our Instruments product line increased 18% in the quarter as reported and it grew 15% in local currency. Instruments had a good quarter with 16% growth in the US and a solid performance overseas. Domestic sales were led by excellent growth in both our System 6 heavy duty and Cordless Driver 3 Micro Power Tools, as well as, incremental sales from the acquired instrument Tunica [ph] clinical product. We also registered solid growth in our Steri-Shield and Neptune Waste Management products.", "International sales in Instruments products were up 12% operationally with growth overseas led by System 6 and interventional pain products along with Micro Power Tools. On a geographic basis Pacific and Canada exceeded 20% constant currency growth and Europe had a very solid quarter.", "Now turning to Endoscopy, that business was up 16% in the quarter as reported and 15% and on an operational basis. Endoscopy had a solid quarter led by the international portion of the business. Domestic sales growth in the key product categories range from high-single digits to mid-teens and we are led by sales of arthroscopy products. International sales were up 18% in cost currency led by sales of our 1188 HD Camera, an excellent growth in general surgery products.", "And our Medical business was up 20% in the quarter as reported and 18% in constant currency. Medical had an excellent quarter around the world. US sales growth was led by strong sales of beds in the EMS products, the stretchers also posting solid growth in the quarter. International sales growth was led by Pacific in Europe with EMS, the top product category.", "Now, I\u2019ll provide some commentary on the rest of the income statement. Gross margins in the quarter were up 20 basis points compared to last year. We ran the plants extremely faster in the quarter with new product introductions and the ramp-up in production to refill the Trident cup pipeline giving us higher absorption in the period. This leverage was partially offset by higher excess and obsolete inventory costs associated with the implant businesses. We anticipate the cost of some of our quality initiatives, which are also hitting this line to ramp up a bit more in the second quarter and still project annual gross margins will be closer to flat with the prior year.", "Growth in spending on research and development was up just 1% in the quarter. Growth was tempered slightly by the timing of the approval of our Orthopaedic division\u2019s needs assessment by our corporate monitor with many activities scheduled for this quarter being cancelled or deferred. The remaining spending in this category is pretty much in line with our plans. SG&A cost increased by 15% on the quarter, primarily as a result of increases in cost associated with compliance activities in growth and sales-related costs. The compliance costs are not insignificant with our legal fees up more than $6 million in the quarter. Selling costs include compensation and instrument amortization costs are growing about in line with our rate of sales growth.", "Operating income increased 19% in the first quarter and operating margins increased to 23.5% of sales. Now for a quick break on other income and expense, investment income was $27.9 million in the quarter. That was offset by interest expense of $7 million in the quarter and a foreign currency transaction loss of $600,000 to get to the total other income of $20.3 million in the quarter. We were able to deliver our budgeted diluted net earnings per share of $0.70 in the first quarter with an effective income tax rate of 28.1%, a rate that was higher than we planned. This rate was similar to those for the 2007 first quarter and year and we still believe we will see these rates decline for 2008 likely by as much as 50 basis points for the year.", "Turning to our balance sheet, we truly believe that\u2019s in excellent shape. Before moving on to accounts receivable and inventory days, I wanted to touch briefly on one category of our investment balances. As many of you know, we hold a small portion of our investments in auction rate securities. We have a $160 million of such securities, all of them relating to student loans, the vast majority of which are guaranteed by the US government. Although we do not believe there is an issue of credit worthiness for these assets, there was currently an issue with liquidity. As a result, we have classified these assets as non-current assets in the March 31, 2008 balance sheet.", "The market valuation reserve in securities has been included as a direct reduction to the equity since we consider any impairment in their value to be temporary.", "Now, turning to accounts receivable. Accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 60 days, up three days from a year ago. We are not overly concerned by this bump up as the impact of the weakening US dollar has a slight negative impact on the calculation and we have not seen any significant deterioration in our US receivables days. Inventory days finished the quarter at 162 days. This is a big jump from the prior year and is also impacted by currency. In addition, that reflects a number of new product introductions. Despite these factors we expect we will be able to drive these inventory levels down over the next several quarters.", "And then finally quick comments on cash flow, we had a great start to the year from a cash flow perspective. Cash from operations up 25% to $191 million. The first quarter was most often our lowest in terms of cash generated and we are well positioned for another outstanding year on this front. As a final note, we want to let you know that we were advised during the quarter that the US Department of Justice has closed its investigation of potential anti-trust offenses, offenses in the Orthopaedic Implants industry. That investigation had been opened in June in 2006.", "And with that I will turn it back over to Steve.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Dean. Now, a few more comments on our 2008 outlook. So, what should you expect from us for the rest of 2008? As we look to the balance of the year, we continue to feel good about our ability to deliver an eighth straight year of double-digit revenue growth and deliver on our 20% EPS goal, all while funding the significant investments we are making in quality and compliance and while recovering from the hip recall, which will still carry over into the second quarter.", "We have nice momentum across a number of businesses and believe that our underlying sales growth will accelerate in the coming quarter. Though we remain mindful of the numerous challenges and unexpected pitfalls, which could lie ahead.", "Once again however, we believe our commitment to ongoing improvement and our strong and unique footprint of businesses will allow us to continue to deliver strong results for the balance of the year and beyond. Also as our cash position continues to build, we see this as an additional tool in our arsenal to continue our strong earnings growth in the years ahead and we continue to look at acquisitions as the primary vehicle. As stated over the last 12 months, we have ramped up our M&A focus and continue to actively evaluate on number of areas. What we would like to again underscore the given the strong underlying performance of our business and our own focus on return on investment not just EPS accretion, we continue to have the luxury to be both patient and choosy and we will continue to operate in this way.", "We all know there are an increasing number of companies being shopped and with our cash position there is a natural speculation that arises, but many do not need our parameters.", "So to wrap it up, we have challenges ahead of us, sure as we all do, but given the very many positive things we also have going for us, we continue to like our challenges. With that we will now open it up for questions and remind everyone that we will take one question from each person with only one follow-up. Thank you.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] From JP Morgan, your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein. Please proceed sir.", "Michael Weinstein - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you, Steve. Thank you, Dean, for taking the questions. A couple of areas that I would like to touch on, I want to cover the FDA issues that that you guys had been addressing and then maybe talk about some of the recent discussion generated by other companies by GE and J&J and so forth. Maybe we start with your FDA relationship and the update there that you can provide today. And I guess there is two things that I would like to know. One, do you have an update on the timing of the Cork and Mahwah anticipated inspection? And two, since we talked to you last publicly in January, have you had inspections, normal course GMP inspections at other facilities where you have gotten either A, a clean bill, or B, have gotten some poor degree?", "Stephen P. MacMillan - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Mike. The -- let\u2019s start on the overall part. I would tell you as we think about our relationship with the FDA right now, we feel like our tone\u2026 the tone of communication has improved certainly over the last 90 days. But I would tell you, we have a lot of work to do and I think we've hopefully very adequately communicated to the agency that we know we have the work to do and we are very focused on it and that when we as an organization get focused on it, we deliver. But ultimately it comes down to... they will be looking for the results. As it relates to specific follow-ups with Mahwah and Cork, I would tell you, we are probably more focused at this point on making sure that when they come back in, we are in great shape and we are probably not pushing for it quite as quickly, we think we are ready, but frankly everyday that goes by we think, gives us a little bit more time and we are more focused on getting it right. Then on... it\u2019d be nice to get that lifted certainly and get that little cloud over us, we really want... just want to make sure we are doing it right and not just rushing it. On the final part, we don't really disclose the specifics on that, but I'd probably go back to feeling that... we feel we are definitely showing some progress, but again still some work to be done.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Lehman Brothers from the line of Bob Hopkins. Please proceed.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thank you. I have a question on hips and then a question on knees. First question on hips, I was wondering if you guys could quantify the impact of the hip recall. By our math, we are thinking that it may be impacted you maybe $15 million to $20 million in the quarter and I\u2019m wondering how much of that would bleed over into the second quarter?", "Stephen P. MacMillan - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Your math is remarkably good, Bob. That's the exact number that Dean and I have, and I don\u2019t know maybe half of that into the second quarter probably.", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Second quarter, yeah.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay.", "Stephen P. MacMillan - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Probably in that range.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Great, that's very helpful. Thank you. And then on the knee side and I ask this about knees just because knees are relatively clean versus hips. Did Easter have any impact... was there a couple of points of growth, just curious there?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Couple of comments, we think Easter did. We'd continue to say as we said in our first quarter call, the first quarter this year was going to be a little funny because of the Easter last year being in April and this year in March. We still generated 12% in the US, our real bugaboo was probably Europe, where frankly we saw technically it\u2019s only one day less, but we saw a lot of vacations and everything else in that. So, I think the overall comment we probably make to everybody is there seems to be a lot of obsession about looking at specific quarters and everybody is looking at fourth quarter versus first quarter. I would say we ought to continue to just keep looking at the overall trends of several quarters together. Because I think that gives you a better overall read. So, thanks, Bob. By the way it just occurred to me that, I think Mike had asked kind of a second question and let me try to cover that, and I am sure somebody else may ask it. Mike, I recall you asked question by GE and J&J, and I would assume that's related to particularly the CapEx expenditures of GE. We would tell you that, we haven't really seen anything different within our MedSurg businesses that we\u2019re always watching very closely there.", "Operator", "Joanne Wuensch is on the line with your next question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you. Could you please give us the status of Cormet Hip Resurfacing product? I know that you\u2019ve delayed the launch of that and the training of that given what happened in the quarter, but some commentary on that would be helpful?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Joanne. Yeah, Smith & Nephew is in a great spot, because of the whole monitoring situation, which is clearly pushed out our training by about six months. We are pleased to say we actually held a training course this month finally. And all of the training that we had scheduled for the first quarter on resurfacing got cancelled because of the monitors and the needs assessments and the reviews. We are now, finally, we got those approved by the monitors and just had our first legitimate course earlier this month. So we think obviously it's clearly delayed our ramp-up on that. We continued to be hopeful about it, but it will start to ramp here we think in the second quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And as a follow-up, do you see any impacts and changes in either cobalt chromium pricing or other materials pricing on your expenses on a go-forward basis? Thank you.", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Great question. Yeah, cobalt chromium, we are absorbing a big, big absolute price increase on that over the course of over the course of the company. Again it's one of those, we would call one of those little body blows that we absorb. But it's a meaningful increase, but we don't see a deterring our ability to deliver our overall numbers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mack Miksic from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Matthew Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I did have one follow-up on the MedSurg business that was asked earlier, the capital equipment or GE-related business and then I had a follow-up on recon. So, I just wanted to make sure I understand what has been driving, we\u2019ve gone through this ad nauseum in the past, but the bed and stretcher business in Medical, is this hospitals making new bed purchases, is it tied to new hospital construction, is there some seasonality in this business around capital budgets, any color you can give us at least what's driving it?", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "On the Medical front, Mack, it really is combinations, but I would say it's both hospital, new\u2026 it's new hospital openings. It's also that we have been broadening out our bed line. You think about it, again you go back five, six, seven years, we were largely a stretcher company and as we have gotten stronger and stronger in the beds, we keep finding new niches to expand into. And so we are getting in the game of as hospitals are either adding or replacing their previous ones. We are just in more and more deals than we ever were and it's why I think we continue to feel pretty good about this. Another point I\u2019d point out as it relates it to our medical and just in general our MedSurg business. Most of our orders are relatively small by standard, we are not selling the kind of capital that a GE is, and I think that clearly keeps us probably at a different level.", "Matthew Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay and then also as we look at recon and knees and hips, in Q1, I mean you showed another pretty strong quarter in knees against pretty strong 17% growth comps, I think in the US last year. Do you see\u2026 did you see any sort of knees picking up some of the slack maybe for hips and as we go into Q2, do you think we\u2019ll see any reversal of that?", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, I\u2019d love to tell you that we did. I would almost tell you it may have been more the office, and I think our hope was exactly as you surmised but I will say that the hip recall took more energy and time out of our sales reps having to really do a lot of explaining. We have realized we are in a new world now when these warning letters go out, immediately on to the Internet and there is all kinds of misinformation out there. Our reps had to do a lot of handholding and a lot of blocking and tackling to get things explained and everything. I think it actually hurt or at least it didn't help our knee business either, so I think we just continued to feel very good about Triathlon, and as Dean mentioned the revision product is off to a very nice to start there.", "Operator", "And from Bear Stearns, your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy. Please proceed.", "Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns", "Hi, good afternoon. I was curious if I could ask a little about the hip recall. I think when we talked back in January you mentioned that you thought that could be result in a matter of weeks, you know, now here we are three months later and you are talking about extending even further now into the next quarter or here in the second quarter, what's behind this having much longer tail than you originally thought?", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Raj. Fair question. I would tell you when, when we are with you in January, the whole thing was just coming down and we were able to get back into production very quickly, certainly within a matter of weeks. It was actually, we were able to get new stuff back into production in a matter of days. But when you actually go through that the global distribution chain and you start to think about all the different sizes and everything else we certainly underestimated the complexity that is here, pull stuff out of every market in the world, get it back in with the right size in the right fits, in the right number of sets. It's been a much more challenging logistical piece than what we hit, we clearly underestimated the complexity.", "Raj Denhoy - Bear Stearns", "So is it fair to say then your [inaudible] mostly are primarily on logistics and really there's not much competitive action happening?", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, it's\u2026 I would tell you our competitors are clearly taking advantage of our that the time that it will take to get us back into the fray. So have we lost some surgeries and two competitors absolutely in the quarter, we certainly hope to get those back over time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mullikin from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Good afternoon. Steve, can you expand on your comments on M&A a little bit more, you had mentioned looking at ROI as opposed to just EPS accretion and I was just wondering if there is anything more to read into that if you have changed how you look at deals at this point versus in the past?", "Stephen P. MacMillan - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have absolutely not changed, that's probably one reason we have been very disciplined acquirers. Let me just give you a real world example. It\u2019s something like a Kyphon. We look at Kyphon, that could have been EPS accretive to us in a fairly quick form, but we couldn't justify that kind of a purchase price. And so as we look at everything, it's [inaudible] we\u2019ve looked a lot of things over the last year, two years and end up passing on them, because we really don't think they hit our capital hurdles, but it\u2019s just a probably a little more clarity around that and probably the other reason we are saying that is we know there's been a lot of speculation more recently. We just got a lot of calls about in \u201880s, this company is for sale, this one is for sale and a lot of rumblings that we're the obvious buyer for so many of these things, and again you are saying don't worry folks, we're not to going to lose our heads just get some things for sale, doesn't mean we are going to jumping and grab it.", "Mark Mullikin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Fair enough and then one follow-up on the knee business, BioMed put up an extremely strong number and had a DTC ad campaign, going on during the quarter and I was just wondering with the DOJ monitors in place now, etcetera, do you think the ETC will start to play a bigger role in driving share shift within the industry?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we are not so sure about that. Keep in mind their quarter didn't line up with the rest of us and I think it\u2019s why these focuses on that quarter, March was probably a very bumpy month, and I\u2026 if I recall their quarter ended in February. Having said they had a great recon quarter. I\u2019ve sent Jeff Weiner a note saying, you guys obviously had a heck of a quarter. Whether it\u2019s the DTC or not, I think we continue to dabble and see what's going on there, but continue to try to focus on the surgeon as well. So, I think it's too early to speculate too much on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Hi. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on the R&D side, as to the reason why\u2026 you mentioned some of the issues with the monitor and [inaudible] you could just explain that a little bit much [inaudible] going forward?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I think to a large degree, Kristen, we\u2019ve filled a fair amount of the R&D pipeline, we have got\u2026 just about every division has a fair amount going on. Having said that some of our R&D resources are devoted a little bit right now to working on some of the quality. I\u2019d say the quality we have and the other part is that with the needs assessment down there are certain projects that are kind of put on a hold, and I think you will probably see this what we\u2019re temporarily put on hold ones that are involving designing surgeons and things like that because some of the meetings could not occur at our Orthopaedics division as Dean referenced probably a little bit less activity there, and that's something that obviously will affect us probably more in the 2009, 2010 time period. But we are guessing it's probably at least a little bit more of a level playing field that my hunch is a number of us may have had a few projects just sort of the slowdown during this time.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And so it sounds like as the percentage of sales we should expect a similar number that what we are seeing in the first quarter or a little bit higher or--?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think it is fair to say it will come up a little bit, Kristen. We\u2026 some of these things that got deferred will come back in some format, I think. You will see some of that spending come back in subsequent quarters, but still for the year and we had indicated at the outset we do expect our R&D spending to slow down. Keep in mind we have been [inaudible] with R&D growing at or above the rate of sales for the last four years, as well.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, this year they\u2019re probably back under the current growth of sales.", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right.", "Operator", "From Leerink Swann, your next question comes from Jason Wittes. Please proceed sir.", "Jason Wittes \u2013 Leerink Swann Llc", "Hi. Just wanted to ask about the FDA issues, can we... could you give us a time frame to think about when the FDA will actually be coming back in to look at everything?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "The truth is we really don't know. It could be\u2026 it could probably be as early as May or June. And it might be longer; they've got so many things on their plate as well right now. And again, I know it\u2019s a little bit of an overhanging concern for you guys. In terms of affecting our business, it\u2019s got farer less day-to-day impact on our business. Again, our focus is ultimately when they do come back and getting it clean build health whether that's May or whether it's October, probably doesn't have a huge impact on the actual operational performance of the company.", "Jason Wittes \u2013 Leerink Swann Llc", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up on R&D, it sounds to me like you are saying that R&D will be now slightly below sales growth this year, which is sort of a slowdown from what we've seen in the past years, is that due to the monitor or is that just\u2026 what those goes along with what you are saying that you\u2019ve kind of over-invested somewhat in R&D and now it's time to bring it back a bit, how should we be thinking about that?", "Stephen P. MacMillan - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The latter, which is exactly if you recall what we said at the start of the year, this is not a change, it was what was in our plan this year. We've invested a lot over the last four years, as Dean said. And now it's time to really bring some of those things that were heavier investments start to see some of those come through.", "Operator", "Michael Matson from Wachovia Capital Markets is on the line with your next question.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Your organic or underlying revenue growth was I guess about 10.3% in the first quarter, and I understand you had your issues with the hip recall and everything that may have added another percent or percent and a half to that, but you\u2019re already kind of at the lower end of your full year guidance range, and yet you've got some kind of tougher comps or the comps get progressively tougher through the year, what gives you the confidence that you can continue to stay in that 11% to 13% range, particularly as we get into the second half of the year?", "Stephen P. MacMillan - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Here is way I think about it, Mike, is we just delivered 10.3% local currency growth with a negative hip number. And clearly as that hip number starts to ramp up over the course of the year, that alone should be good. The other thing we\u2019d remind you is think about it this way, five of our eight franchises grew over 15%. And while some of those may moderate a little bit and they are going against tough comps, we are used to going up against tough comps. Our US Trauma business, as Dean mentioned, has been up 20% for nine straight quarters now and we hate to say it, but I think we think we can continue that run, Spine has been up, I think, six quarters in a row, CMF seven quarters in a row, all over 20. So they've been going against some tough comps, obviously keeps getting harder, but we... as part of setting the bar high and continuing to go over it. So I think we continue to feel hips have got to start to contribute for us, and hopefully, that will be the key while the others may moderate a little bit. But we feel pretty good about our product flow, about a lot of our fundamentals.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay. And then with regard to the Triathlon revision rollout, where do you think you stand with that and in terms of the instruments getting them into the field, getting surgeons trained and what is the kind of timeline there?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are still pretty early. We just launched that at our January sales meeting, really started to get in... stuff out to the field in the beginning of February. So... and we are not exactly... as we've said in the past, we are not exactly the fastest launchers, having said that the uptick has been...", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, and I would say... one thing we are targeting and doing a little bit better, Mike, is making sure that we have got instruments that's ready to go. So I think we are in reasonable stead and the sales force uptick has been very, very good. So I think... but it is early, but it was a good first quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from UBS. Please proceed.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Thanks so much. If worse comes worse and you guys receive a corporate warning letter, could you kind of ballpark the incremental spend, if any, as a percent of sales relative to where you are now?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Bruce, probably not a lot different, because I would tell you we are essentially... we\u2019ve basically developed an in-house program that is modeled after what effect did happen and what would it take to get where we want to get. So I would tell you if we are investing a significant amount here, having said that, we never know until you never know. But we've looked at what we want to do to get there and we think it's in that range. I mean, again we're absorbing... it's clearly tens of millions of additional dollars in investment this year. And as a reminder we've not changed our guidance.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Okay. And my follow-up is at the end of '06, you were very gracious and kind of volunteered that hip and knee unit growth in the US was below the trend line and we calculate somewhere between 3% and 4% or so. In '07, what sort of year do you think the market had for unit growth in the United States for hips and knees?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "The market... you guys are probably better [inaudible] knees were what high single-digit?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Probably, and hips probably in the mid single-digit, it's probably our best estimate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Hi, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my questions.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "First, another question on Trident, any chance you would be willing to provide more specific details on the current supply status of PSL and Hemi in different geographies?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I don't know. We don't want to get overly specific. I think what's fair to say is that it's starting to come back. And obviously, I think we would feel kind by the end of this month, we should be in really good shape in the United States and probably another month and we should be back to where we want to be overseas. But suffice it to say the way that we are looking at this is to trying to look at surgical needs on a very detailed basis in all of the markets everyday and try to hit the markets often as we can. And we are starting to do a lot better job than that. So I think we do feel like we are going to have it in very good shape by the end of the quarter.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay. And specific to the incremental cost that you are incurring to improve quality controls, longer term, is it right to think of these costs as being higher in the near term and subsiding sometime in the future... several quarters from now, because what I am trying to get out is in a year from now, is there some leverage potential as these costs potentially subside a bit?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "We think certainly over the longer term, this is a invest now to be healthier later. It's probably more... I'd probably say in some ways it may be more of a two year-ish, it's going to vary depending on where we are in our certain plants. But I think again we feel good about the nearer term and ultimately figure that there will be some leverage there going forward whether it\u2019s a year from now, whether it\u2019s 18 months, whether it\u2019s 24 months, probably a little premature to fully say, but certainly the... once we invest, get everything right, there ought to be some efficiencies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Michael Jungling from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you. I have a question on acquisitions, you've indicated in the past that there are several areas that you found very attractive, but they were too expensive. Many of these areas have now sort of being de-rated by 50% or more, and I am just wondering whether this puts acquisitions on the full front compared to where you were last year. So [inaudible] building type going on here at Merrill Lynch? And secondly on the recall costs, can you quantify what the total costs whether you've incurred as a result of the recall in the first quarter? Thank you.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Michael. We are not going to buy Merrill Lynch by the way, just... certainly some things have come down. And that... it's why we are probably more actively looking at a number of things right now and... but again in terms of what we can really get them for and how they fit into our business, we continue to just kind of sort it out, but it's probably a better buying time today than it was 12 months ago. On the second one, Dean, do you want to kind of quantify? The second question was the costs of the recall, obviously we shared with you probably that $15 million to $20 million we have lost revenue in the quarter and we would tell you there has been underneath it, there are number of costs on...", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, it's fair to say that obviously one of the\u2026 in the margin line, I referenced excess and obsolete cost, you can assume that there is a reasonable cost to the product that's come back that's hitting our gross margin as a result of this as well.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "All of which has us frankly feel pretty good about delivering $0.70 of share in a quarter where we absorbed the lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "William Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Great, thanks. Good evening. I am going to ask just a couple of simple P&L questions here. Just, is it in point in time the interest rate on your cash balances, if you could give us some guidance there and then would you be able to quantify the monitoring cost per quarter or for the year just ballpark until this is done? And then any kind of guidance on or color on what acquisitions added to the top line in the quarter? Thank you.", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, sure, Bill, on the interest rate, it's probably I would say, fair to say it's around 4%, but it is going to be dropping obviously as we replenish and have to replace investments that are in the portfolio today. Relative to acquisition impact on the top line vary insignificant in fact, obviously that would be one of the we would have if that were significant enough to be included in the analysis of our price volume and so on and so forth in terms of the make up of the top line. And the... what was the third question?", "William Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "The monitoring cost--?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I don't know that we want to go into a lot of real specifics there as I said in SG&A, our SG&A is riding up higher than we would like. Obviously, we\u2019ve indicated we think it will be down for the year as a percentage of sales. I still believe that, but this was a tough quarter and as I said more than $6 million, so that gives you some sense of what we are up against there.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "You gain nothing. Probably jumped in and reiterate with that huge increase in legal fees that is something that hopefully over time we\u2019ll also moderate and again hopefully give us a chance in terms of additional growth in the years ahead.", "William Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, guys. This is Sas [ph] for Tao. Thanks for taking the question.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Sas.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "First, the remediation plan, your quality remediation plan, is it all inclusive over all your plans, and will it be fully rolled out by the end of 2009?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. We... essentially, what we are doing is recognizing\u2026 when you got two warning letters, they were looking at both issues specific to those plants, but also across the division. But we are treating it as an opportunity to say, hey, wait a minute, let\u2019s go and apply that same thinking across our entire network, and that's why we want to be out in front of this given that we were probably behind it. Now we want to go to the other extreme and get out in front across our whole network.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "And the timing,  would --", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "We would certainly hope by the end of the 2009 that we are in great shape. Will there still be little pockets by that point?  Probably, but I\u2019d say our organization is incredibly focused putting a lot of time and energy into this. We hope to be certainly in a much better state even by the end of this year.", "Unidentified Analyst - Deutsche Bank", "And just one follow up. Do you have any update on the launch of Sightline or still the same Q4 expectations?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Q4 probably still the best and that one may slip into next year. We are still working through it and given that we\u2019ve kind of missed a little bit on timing on some of those, we\u2019re probably going to not over --- want to still temper the expectations there.", "Operator", "And from Banc of America Securities, your next question comes from Steve Lichtman. Please proceed.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc Of America Securities", "Hi, guys. Thanks. Just a couple of follow ups here. On cash flow, what should we think about in terms of CapEx this year, and as we exist the year, where would you target inventory days getting to?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "On CapEx, Steve, I would say probably somewhere in the 190 to 215 range is probably a good estimate. And DSO, I think we have finished last year at 137. We will probably be a little bit higher this year, so I would hope to get it into the low 140s.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "On DII", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "On DII, yes.", "Steven Lichtman - Banc Of America Securities", "Yes. Okay, thanks. And then just on the analyst day coming up in a few weeks, maybe you can talk broadly what we should expect, is it just similar to what we have seen today or last prior years?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it will be similar, will probably be a little bit\u2026 we are going to leave a little bit more time, so hopefully we can get a little bit deeper but we are, as you know, there is only so deep we are going to go about pipeline things, but I think we hope to give little better understanding about certainly part of the business. I know you\u2019ve dug into more over time, which is our MedSurg business. That is a big part of our business, and continues to probably raise some questions, so if I give a little more... a little more there.", "Operator", "From Goldman Sachs, your next question comes from Larry Keusch. Please proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, everybody. It's Charlie Chan [ph] for Larry. How is it going?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Charlie. Great, yeah.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Dean, first of all, I was wondering if I could start with you. Could you help us better understand how the positive impact from foreign currency on the top line may have flowed to the P&L to the bottom line, and if in particular you could just touch on how gross margin may have benefit there just because the benefit was a lot... or gross margin came in better than what we had been expecting despite the higher cost inputs and absorbing the return products, so if you could just speak to that, that\u2019d be really helpful. And also just a quick follow up to a question that was posed earlier, I just to want to confirm, are you suggesting that you will have the hemi cut [ph] back in the US in the next few weeks?", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. The FX impacts, I would say that it does not have that much of an impact. We\u2019ve touched on this before, but when the dollar weakens, we get probably a little bit of positive impact to the bottom line, but we have so many natural hedges in place in terms of where we manufacture. So, as an example, our Spine and Trauma products, which as you know are doing extremely well in the US, those are manufactured in Europe, and as a result of that, we\u2019re taking some pretty significant hits on currency impacts as those products come back to the US to be sold. And some portion of our recon products also have the same characteristics. So when we net everything out, because of our natural hedging, it really does not have that big of an impact, and that's one of the reasons I did not mention it as one of the... as much of an impact really on gross margin specifically.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Harp on EPS, would it be fair to assume that the impact there would be negligible as well?", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Exactly. And that\u2019s what I was saying, all the way down to the bottom line.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up on the gross margin, would it be a fair to think that gross margins should trend at these levels throughout the reminder of the year, or should we start to see some of that customary seasonality or as your plans run less hot, could we see gross margins come in?", "Dean H. Bergy - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. So, I think you're going to see at least kind of three factors. And as I said, we expect them to be\u2026 I would expect them to be flattish if not a little bit down when we get to the end of the year. And the reasons are, we will run the factories, we traditionally run the factories slower in the second half. We do have a seasonality impact in the third quarter with our MedSurg businesses being a bigger piece of the business for the elective [ph] surgery schedules down in the summer months. And then the other thing as I eluded to is, we do expect, starting in this next quarter, to see a little bit further ramp up on some of our cost of quality, which I would expect to hit probably second and third quarters a little bit harder on the gross margin line.", "Operator", "Greg Halter from The Great Lakes Review is on the line with your next question.", "Greg Halter - The Great Lakes Review", "Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter, again.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Greg.", "Greg Halter - The Great Lakes Review", "Dean, quick one on your debt, is it still around $17 million or $20 million on a total basis?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's right around $18 million, Greg.", "Greg Halter - The Great Lakes Review", "And then one last one, on the critical care bed, I think it's called InTouch, can you give us any feedback on how that's being received by the market?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Two straight quarters of medical growth over 20%, we think it's off to a pretty good start.", "Greg Halter - The Great Lakes Review", "Okay.", "Dean H.

Please proceed.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Hi. Thanks for taking my follow up. I was just wondering if you could talk a little about mix trends, specifically maybe for knee. I know Triathlon is now a big part of it, where do you see mix trends kind of going in the hip and knee side as we look ahead?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes Kristen, I think mix kind of moves around always over history, if you will, and probably in terms of some of the products we have had introduced. It\u2019s probably a little slower today than it was in the last couple years, but I think as always, we believe we will have new products coming in, and certainly we\u2019ll try up on PKR and try up on TS, those are products that probably contribute to mix. So, I would always tell people that we would expect mix to kind of always be 1% to 3% of our sales, and it's 5 not 3 very often, but I think it will always be in that range, and it's only yesterday, and I think it will move around but be in that range.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "You said that pricing was down overall in the quarter --", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I said actually pricing was rounded up to being up 1% and there is no offset in there with the Japan pricing. So, prices in the rest of the world and that's pretty normalized. The cost at our businesses are up a little bit, but slightly.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay. Last one of the tax rate,  should we expect 28% going forward?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, as I said there, again, we are comfortable with that rate today, but I think as we go through the remainder of the year, we would expect it to come down as much as 50 basis points, which could get it as low as 27.6 for the year.", "Operator", "We have a follow-up question from the line of Mike Weinstein from J.P.

MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "So am I.", "Michael Weinstein - J.P. Morgan", "Sorry, we got lost earlier, Steve. I did want to make sure we understood a couple of items from your earlier comment. One is that in the course of GMP inspections, the FDA going through the facilities that there hadn't been any issues. To me, that's really is as important as anything here, and just on this overhang, if you would, of the FDA's relationship with you guys. And then second, just going up a second to the operating with a different company off, and then second, the commentary about all the activity in March. So, in March, we've seen this... in particular... sorry in March, we saw this\u2026 we've seen this activity increase at not-for-profit hospitals, at community hospitals, that GE ascribed some of their issues to, and from your vantage point, just to be clear... and you guys have very limited exposure here. I'd assume some maybe in your iSuite and in  your beds business, but from your exposure, you are not seeing that at all at this point in April in your business? Thanks.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, Mike. Let me take your second one first. We are not... I'd tell you we've got our ear to the \u2013 our ears very closely focused. And as you point out, within our broader MedSurg business, there\u2019s probably only two pieces of capital that would rise to that level. One would be the iSuite,. and the other would be major bed orders. We are not seeing it at this point. We always... when you see a company as great as GE get surprised and everything else, it always makes you a little bit nervous, and we're kind of trying to watch and stay close to it. But we don't really see it affecting our business at this point. Back on the FDA inspections, I know, you're probably wishing us to review a little bit more detail than we want to get into. We are not getting to get into reporting on individual site inspection. We will tell you certainly if we got another warning letter or something else really bad, we will disclose it, I would tell you pretty promptly. But in the meantime, I want to avoid getting into a situation where we start to report on every single FDA inspection, both from our standpoint, but also I want to be careful as we think about our relationship with the FDA as well there. So. Hopefully, you will understand that.", "Operator", "We have another follow-up question your line of Bob Hopkins from Lehman Brothers.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments on cobalt chromium. Could you let us know what percentage of your implant costs are made up by cobalt, and  give us any senses to how much the price has gone\u2026 price has increased?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Oh, yikes, there you are. Bob, that\u2019s a little more granular than I think we want to get at this point in time. It's...the price increases are pretty substantial on a percentage basis. If you look at the overall business and the margins involved, it's a reasonable proportion than that, but it's not overwhelming, something we can't handle, but obviously something we\u2019d prefer not to.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "It's also where, Bob, back to the fact that our business is much more diversified. No one franchise remembers more than 20% of our business.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Right.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "And so any of those, while they can be meaningful and very significant for a certain franchise, we tend to find abilities across the broader corporation to balance those things.", "Bob Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "And then just to follow upon Mike\u2019s question, which is more capital related, the other thing that\u2019s come out of the earnings season so far is, J&J\u2019s comments about procedure volumes in general surgery, and I know again you don't necessarily touch on this in a significant way, but I am just curious, you talked a little bit about capital? Are you seeing anything on the surgical procedure volume side that's noteworthy at this point?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, not dramatically. And again I just... I think sometimes there is so much read into quarterly variations where couple of days can matter frankly whether depending on how many Fridays are in a quarter versus how many Mondays and Tuesdays. When we start to look so much at specific quarters, how many days were in the quarter, you are going to see some variation. I would want to see how everybody\u2019s second quarter goes before you can really conclude anything upon that. I do think they made a distinction, which, I think you are referring to as well, that their DuPuy business was different than their Ethicon business, and we continue to try to stay close. We are probably not nearly as involved in the general surgery businesses they are to have necessarily picked it up, but they might be closer to it than we are. So, we will stay close to it.", "Operator", "Your next follow up question comes from the line of Michael Jungling from Merrill Lynch.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you. I wanted to ask a question on, if you look your excellent four months volume growth, I am just curious I am not just driven by being very price focused, and the reason I ask is because a major competitor is surprised about your pricing policy basically in trauma and spine, so a comment on that would be very helpful. Thank you?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are not deep discounters on pricing, Michael, pure and simple. I think you look at our\u2026 people throw around different excuses here or there. We do not compete on price.", "Michael Jungling - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next follow up questions comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Morgan Stanley.", "Matthew Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, again. Thanks for taking the follow up. Just that, Dean, you had mentioned an increase, $6 million increase in legal related to some of these compliance spending requirements that you have, and I am assuming, I just want to confirm that's around FCPA and the FDA letters, is that right?", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And the DOJ.", "Matthew Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "And the DOJ. And is that sort of\u2026 I mean if you were to look at when that started, I guess, in that third quarter, a lot of this started second and third quarter of last year, maybe the third or fourth quarter, but what... in total what's... how do we think about that block of spending, is that a $10 million requirement that you are facing now for all those things together or is it a bit more, bit less?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Whenever it is, it's too much.", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "I\u2019ll say. Let me \u2013", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I\u2019d say it's fair to say it\u2019s  a bit more than that, and I guess I will leave it at that.", "Matthew Miksic - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. I won't push you on that. But\u2026 and one follow up of on the R&D comment that you made about getting the benefits this year, next year, the year after I guess driven by a lot of the investments you\u2019ve made over the past few years. Can give us a sense of where you see some of those benefits concentrating across your businesses? What types of areas you expect to see new product launches this year and next, for example, which we look?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, we will probably touch on that a little bit more at the meeting on the eighth. I would just continue to tell you, it's across all divisions. We don't get the growth rates above market in basically seven of our eighty franchises without steady product flow across the board, and again it's a lot of singles and doubles, it's not the grand slam home runs that the one key eureka product that people are usually looking for.", "Operator", "From UBS, your next hour comes from the line of Bruce Nudell. Mr. Nudell your line is open. You may proceed with your question.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "Oh, yes, thanks. Steve, the way you described it, most of the recall related impact on the market was due to logistics. Are there any hangovers with regards to the product per se, in another words the ceramic on ceramic squeaking issue and Strykewear [ph] and fracture were mentioned in one of the warning letters, do you feel that once a product is fully available, you will go back to your kind of baseline share as it were?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "We certainly hope so, Bruce. But there have been a few doctors that may have used this as an opportunity to try some competitive products, and we are going to have to work to get them back. We clearly dug ourselves in a little bit of a hole, but once again, we will get back out there and fight for that.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS", "But I guess my question is, do you feel that the people who tended to use ceramic-on-ceramic will go back to that product type?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we do. And keep in mind at this point, our ceramic-on-ceramic penetration is down about 10%, with our X3 which has done so well, ceramic-on-ceramic can really become a much smaller piece of our business, and It\u2019s really found that niche for the younger patients and the surgeons who had a lot of very good experiences with it.", "Operator", "Your next follow-up comes from the line of Jason Wittes from Leerink Swann.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann Llc", "Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on your comments on the Cormet Hip Resurfacing  product, and that is my impression was that you did start some training last... some time early last year, and I guess you were saying that you just started at the end of this quarter. My first question is, A, is that timing sequence correct? B, can you give an indication of how many doctors you've trained and, C, are you going to have to get approvals for each time you want to set up a training session from the monitor?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me try to take those in pieces. We held like... just a couple of very small courses I think in December --", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann Llc", "Okay.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "-- that had been set up. Then we held nothing in the first quarter where we had a lot of them scheduled. Recall the product was first cleared in July of last year. We then had to get some additional clearance from FDA around the initial training, which is why the first courses didn't happen until very late last year with a limited number of surgeons. Then we planned for it in the first quarter, that's also been now pushed out to the second quarter. We are not going to clarify specific numbers of surgeons trained. We just generally stay away from that. And the third part of the question was...", "Dean H. Bergy \u2013 Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Based on the DoJ monitor clearance, I mean the knees assessment that's been done is for the full year. So, that would encompass our training needs for the full year, and as... what we think we need to do those has been built in. But we always do have the ability for, if we think we need to deviate from that plan to go back to the monitor and get his clearance to do that, but we think we got what we need in the plan.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann Llc", "So, at this point, we can assume that you are... this quarter we'll see a much larger training progression?", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "The training progression, yes.", "Jason Wittes - Leerink Swann Llc", "Okay.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Finally, is that it, operator?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. There are no more further questions in queue. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Stephen MacMillan for closing remarks.", "Stephen P. MacMillan \u2013 President and Chief Executive Officer", "Great. Well, thank you, Denise. We appreciate that. Just a couple of final comments again. Despite a few challenges, our broad based model came through once again. We feel pretty good, we delivered $0.70 a share and another overall solid quarter and a lot of good things going on around the company. Our conference call for our second quarter 2008 operating results will be held on July 17. And again as a reminder, we will be having our Analyst Day in New York on May 8. So, thank you, everybody.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This call concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

(NYSE:SYK) Q4 2008 Earnings Call January 27, 2009  4:30 PM ET", "Executives", "Stephen MacMillan - President and CEO", "Katherine Owen - VP, Strategy and Investor Relations", "Dean Bergy - VP and CFO", "Analysts", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Securities", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Operator", "Good day ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter 2008 Stryker earnings conference call. My name is Amity and I'll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. We will facilitate a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference. (Operator instructions).", "Certain statements made in today's conference call may constitute forward-looking statements. They will be based upon management's current expectations and will be subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.", "In addition to factors that may be discussed in this call, such factors include, but are not limited to: further weakening of economic conditions that could adversely affect the level of demand for the company's products, pricing pressures generally including cost containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the company's products, changes in foreign exchange market, regulatory actions, unanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and otherwise that affect United States Food and Drug Administration approval of new products, changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payers, a significant increase in product liability claims, changes in financial markets, and changes in the competitive environment. ", "Additional information concerning these and other factors are contained in the company's filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form-10K and Quarterly Reports on Form-10Q. ", "Today's conference call will also include a discussion of adjusted net earnings from continued operation for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31st, 2008 and the comparative year ended December 31st, 2007. Further, discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures including GAAP reconciliation's that appears in the company's Form 8-K filed today with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which may be accessed from the for investor's page on the company's website at www.stryker.com. ", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, President and CEO of Stryker, Mr. Stephen MacMillan. Please proceed sir.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2008 earnings report. With me today are Dean Bergy, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Curt Hartman, Vice President, Finance and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. ", "As you are aware, Dean will be stepping down from his role as CFO at the end of Q1 '09, though we will continue to benefit from his considerable insights, as he will remain as an adviser to our team. I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank Dean for all of his support and leadership over the years. His contribution to Stryker has been considerable. ", "We would also like to formally introduce Curt Hartman to the investor community. As many of you know, Curt is a long time veteran of the organization, having most recently run our very successful instruments division and his operational expertise will play a critical role as we look to drive continued margin improvements and operational excellence going forward. ", "Turning to the review of our quarterly results, it's clear that 2008 presented us with unprecedented internal and external challenges, including a global economy that contracted sharply in Q4, the considerable and rapid strengthening of the US dollar, the Trident Hip recall early in the year, $50 million to $55 million of incremental investment in compliance, and the Department of Justice monitoring costs. ", "Despite these significant challenges, as an organization we still deliver top tier results, with our eighth consecutive year of double-digit sales growth at 10.5 % in constant currency, reflecting the depth and breadth of our diversified sales base that resulted in six of our eight key franchises achieving sales growth above 10% for the year. ", "Although our earnings per share growth for 2008 is below our original target, at an increase of 18%, we demonstrated our ability to consistently deliver robust earnings growth that compares favorably to our Medtech peer group even during an exceptionally turbulent environment, both internally and externally.", "On a geographic basis, growth was again reasonably balanced with the US posting an 11% increase for the year, while international was up 13% reported and 9% operationally. Looking at Q4, US sales were up 7%, while international was up a solid 9% operationally, though was down 2% as reported, due to the substantial strengthening of the dollar. ", "Our diversified footprint remains a key competitive advantage, as it limits the overall impact from a slowdown in specific divisions. During the fourth quarter, five of our eight key franchises posted double-digit constant currency worldwide growth, led by our stellar spinal franchise, which was up 17% globally and a robust 20% in the US, despite very difficult year-over-year comparisons. ", "Spine continues its multiyear track record of 20% or greater growth. Globally, our knee franchise continue to gain share with 15% growth operationally, while hips were flat operationally recognizing the tough year-over-year comparisons. CMF and trauma were also strong contributors in the quarter, both up 12% operationally. In total, our orthopedic implant business was up 4% reported in fourth quarter and 9% operationally. ", "As we detailed in our earlier press releases, the challenging economic environment placed considerable pressure on hospital capital budgets during Q4, which translated into slower growth for two of our MedSurg businesses.", "Though even here, the increasing strength of our diversified product line and geographic makeup came through. Specifically, while our endoscopy and medical businesses both declined modestly in the United States, each achieved double-digit operational growth outside the US, thereby cushioning the impact of the US softness. Meanwhile the biggest leg of our MedSurg business, our instruments franchise achieved stellar US growth of 18% but was actually soft overseas.", "Overall, we believe our fourth quarter and full year results speak to the strength of our unique footprint, which helps drive consistency in our sales and earnings growth by limiting the impact from a slowdown in a specific division, while providing opportunities to enter adjacent markets. As a company, we have a history of delivering a steady flow of new products that both expand markets and drive share gains.", "Lastly, we continue to see opportunities for geographic expansion in all of our businesses, with particular opportunities for our MedSurg businesses outside the US. With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Steve. I'd like to provide update on our compliance initiatives, endoscopy's, new product launch in OP-1, all of which are tropical items in our warehouse. ", "As many of you are aware, we currently got three warning letters which drove our decision to undertake a comprehensive approach to compliance. These efforts which include implementing a common set of quality standard throughout our company, allow us to not only address the issues raised in the warning letters, but are also galvanizing the organization around moving towards excellence and compliance. ", "We invested an incremental $50 to $55 million in 2008 in compliance versus 2007 and expect the 2009 incremental investment versus 2007 to be in the $60 to $90 million range. Encouragingly, during 2008, we had twice as many FDA inspections of our facilities compared to the prior year and we think we are demonstrating meaningful progress. ", "However, we still have work to do as evidenced by the Q4 recall of one of our CMF products. This product was manufactured and supplied to us by a vendor that recently received an FDA warning letter underscoring the importance of our compliant efforts, which includes validating our vendors in order to improve product quality. 2009 represents a year two of a three-year intensive compliance initiative recognizing we expect to make ongoing investments beyond that time frame. ", "Our goal for 2009 is to have successful re-inspections of our facilities with warning letters and to achieve a compliance model that will drive greater operating efficiencies in 2010 and beyond. As is our policy, we will not get into any specifics regarding possible re-inspection dates or confirm whether or not anything has been scheduled. Rather, we'll report back to you in a timely manner, pending receipt, tangible results from the FDA regarding our compliance program. ", "On the new product front, we wanted to highlight the recent launch of endoscopy's new 1288 HD 3-Chip camera which was rolled out to our sales force in just the past few weeks. If those of you who have followed our company for some time are aware, fluctuation in its endoscopy sales growth is primarily a function of new product launches, particularly when we introduce the next generation camera.", "The 1288 is able to capture images at a higher resolution via a 1920 by 1080p resolution, which we believe yield the picture quality that is unmet by our competitors. In addition to the camera, we are launching our 26 inch HDTV wide wireless monitors, which in conjunction with the 1288, is the first HDTV wireless system in the surgical marketplace. The system delivers HDTV 1080p resolution in an un-tethered manner, throughout the operating room. ", "Finally endoscopy is rolling out its L9000 Light Source, which is the industries first surgical LED Light Source. The L9000 provides unmatched light output, but is cooler than xenon. In addition, it's eco-friendly and cost effective and that the bulb never needs to be changed. Although, we expect the current capital spending environment to limit the initial uptick for these new product launches. As we enter the second half of '09 and move towards 2010, we believe this exciting new portfolio endoscopy offerings will be an important growth driver for the division.", "For those of you attending next month American Academy of Orthopedics Surgeons Meeting in Las Vegas, we will be hosting booth tours, where you can see new product launches, including endoscopy's 1288 camera and related offerings. Regarding OP-1, on our last call we informed you that our PMA submission, including the additional prospective data we collected, would be reviewed by the FDA, Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Devices Panel on February 3rd. Owing to scheduling conflict, the FDA had since informed us that the panel will be rescheduled to March 31st, 2009 in order to ensure the appropriate personnel can be a attendant. ", "Although, there is still uncertainty regarding both the outcome of the panel and the FDAs opening decisions decision regarding the PMA submission, we remain encouraged that we will have an opportunity to present the broad data package. As has been our policy, it would not be appropriate to discuss the specifics of the trial, including our decision to collect additional prospective data ahead of the upcoming panel and therefore we will not be making any additional comments regarding OP-1. ", "I will now turn it over to Dean for more details.", "Dean Bergy", "Thanks, Katherine. I'll start by discussing the considerable unfavorable impact that foreign currency had on our fourth quarter sales. The strengthening of the US dollar and the majority of our overseas markets reduced international sales by $68 million in the quarter and reduced the company's overall sales growth by 4.1%. In the fourth quarter, the dollar strengthened approximately 10% against the euro and weakened approximately 15% against yen when compared to prior year rates. ", "Significant unfavorable currency impacts were also experienced in the UK, Australia and Canada. If currency rates hold near current levels, we expect the impact of foreign currency will decrease the first quarter 2009 sales by about 4.5% to 5.5% when compared to 2008.", "Now I'll spend a moment on the impact of price and volume mix on the top line. Selling prices were flat on a worldwide basis in the quarter with domestic prices up slightly and the international prices declining as a result of the April 1st, 2008 government reimbursement cuts in Japan. Japanese pricing declined 4% in the quarter. Volume mix growth was 8% in the fourth quarter, which had one less selling day compared to the prior year.", "Volume mix was generally as expected for orthopedic implant products, but volumes were up considerably for endoscopy and medical business particularly in the US. Overall, our domestic volume mix growth was 7% in the quarter and international volume mix growth came in at 10%.", "Now I'll turn to our product category starting with orthopedic implants which represents 59% of our sales. Sales of orthopedic implants grew by 4% in the fourth quarter on a reported basis and 9% on constant currency. Keep in mind that the fourth quarter includes one less selling day versus 2007, so on a sequential basis, constant currency growth of 9% compared well with 10% growth last quarter, a period that included one additional selling day. ", "We provided the sales growth rates by product line in our press release and I'll reference those as I provide more detail on our product performance. Starting with hips, they were down 6% in dollars and flat operationally in the fourth quarter. Hips slowed a bit this quarter, but this was expected given one less selling day compared to last year and a tough comparable of 10% US and 8% worldwide constant currency growth in the prior year period. US hip sales were flat in the fourth quarter, incremental Cormet hip resurfacing sales as well as growth in Restoration Modular Revision products were offset by declines in other hip products. ", "Year-over-year, Trident sales were flat in the quarter compared to declines in pervious quarters. On a sequential basis, US hip sales were up mid-single digits versus third quarter levels. European constant currency hip sales declined slightly in the quarter. Accolade, X3 Polyethylene, and Restoration Modular Hip Revision products, each had solid growth which was offset by declines in other hip products. ", "In Japan, hip sales declined at mid single digit levels on an operational basis due to the government price cuts in the impact of one less selling day. Volume gains were in the low to mid-single digit range led by Exeter. Local currency sales in the remaining international markets increased mid-single digits in the quarter with Pacific posting the best results in these markets. ", "Now turning to Knees, they grew 9% a dollars and 15% in constant currency in the quarter. Knees had an excellent fourth quarter with our domestic business again leading the way. US knee sales growth came in at 16%, the 36th consecutive quarter of double digit knee growth domestically. Primary knee has posted low double digit level growth led by Triathlon. Revision knee growth paced by our Triathlon TS revision product was again extremely strong and we continue to benefit from building sales of the Triathlon PKR product.", "European knee sales were down slightly operationally, partially as a result of one last selling day. Growth in Triathlon products was offset by declines in other knee systems. Japan posted mid-single digits operational decline in knees after considering the impact of the price reduction. ", "Our Pacific knee business posted solid results in the quarter led by Scorpio and Canada and Latin America, and knee sales increase mid-single digits on an operational business with growth led by Triathlon in Canada and Scorpio in Latin America.", "Turning to trauma that was up 9% in dollars and 12% in local currency this quarter. Our trauma business had a very solid quarter led by U.S. Domestic sales growth was 18% and would have been 14% of military sales were excluded. This was an excellent performance when considered against last year's 24% fourth quarter growth.", "Sales of Gamma3 Hip Fracture, Hoffman II External Fixator, VariAx Distal Radius and Foot Plating System products led our U.S. trauma grow. International trauma sales were up 8% operationally in the quarter. Europe posted constant currency growth just shy of double digits. In Japan, local currency trauma sales grew in the mid single-digits specific to where the remaining international trauma business is posting growth above 30% operationally. On a product line basis, international trauma sales were again paced by growth and upper extremity at foot and ankle products.", "Spine grew 15% in dollars and 17% on operational basis in the quarter. Spine franchise had another excellent quarter with U.S. again leading the way and international operational growth reaching double digits for the second straight quarter.", "US spine sales grew 20% against an exceedingly difficult prior year comparable of 32% growth. Domestic spine growth was led by interbody and thoracolumbar products. International spine sales posted operational growth of 10% led by thoracolumbar products.", "On a geographic basis, Europe grew at mid-teens levels on a constant currency basis while Pacific and Japan grew at mid-single digit levels operationally.", "And then last in this product set, our CMF business was up 8% in dollars and 12% in constant currency in the quarter, and CMF had a very solid quarter. Domestic growth of 13% was based by sales of maxillofacial and neuro products and international local currency sales growth came in 11%, but benefited from a very easy prior year comparable.", "Now, turning to our MedSurg group. As you know, this represents 41% of our sales comprised of three significant product categories instruments comprising 18% of total company sales, endoscopy 14% and medical 9% to come up with that total of 41%.", "As has been well-publicized by now, our MedSurg group had a mixed quarter. On the plus side instruments had an excellent quarter in the U.S. and endoscopy and medical did well internationally.", "However, these performances could not offset the impact that US hospital belt-tightening had on our domestic endoscopy and medical franchises as well as softer instruments quarter outside the US MedSurg sales growth was 3% for the quarter on a reported basis and 6% on an operational basis.", "And, then touching briefly on the product categories here. Sales for our instruments product line were up 9% in the quarter on a reported basis and 13%, operationally. Instruments had a very strong quarter in the US with sales up 18%. International sales growth was softer as a result of the ramp-up of shipments of our System 6 Heavy-Duty Power Tools to overseas markets following a late third quarter voluntary recall of that product.", "Endoscopy's fourth quarter sales were down 5% in US dollars and 2% in constant currency. Endoscopy was hurt by both the significant falloff in capital demand and the state of its own product cycle with the new 1288 HD camera and related video products launching in recent weeks. Domestic sales declined 7% with video down significantly. International sales with 15% operational growth did not experience the same slowdown of being on a smaller base.", "And then our medical business grew 4% in the quarter as reported and 7% in constant currency. Medical declined 2% in the US, but had an excellent quarter overseas. Domestic sales saw a modest growth in the EMS products offset by declining sales. And the international business for medical grew over 50% operationally on a small base.", "Now I'll turn to the remainder of the income statement beginning with gross margins. Fourth quarter gross margins declined 80 basis points compared to 2007, primarily as a result of the costs for internal and external resources working at our compliance initiatives. Margins were also negatively impacted by higher freight costs.", "Research and development spending was down 2% in the quarter, but was up 8% on a sequential basis to reach 5.8% of sales in the quarter, a high water mark for the year, and in line with our budget on a gross spending basis.", "Selling, general and administrative costs, decreased 2% in the quarter, primarily as a result of reduced discretionary spending partially offset by increases in sales-related costs. Selling costs include compensation and instrument amortization costs, and again grew below the rate of sales growth due to slowing instrument amortization.", "During the fourth quarter, we decided to simplify the structure of our Japanese distribution business and to substantially reduce development efforts associated with Sightline Product Technologies acquired in 2006.", "As a result, we recorded a $35 million pre-tax restructuring charge in the quarter, which reduced net earnings by $22 million or $0.05 a share. Excluding the impact of this restructuring charge, adjusted operating income increased 12% in the fourth quarter and adjusted operating margins increased 23.6% of sales.", "I'll provide a quick breakdown of other income and expense for the quarter that was made up of investment income of $19.9 million, offset by interest expense of $8.3 million, and a foreign currency transaction loss of $1.8 million to get to total other income of $9.8 million in the quarter.", "The company's effective income tax rate was 26.9% for the fourth quarter 2008 and 27.4% for the year in line with the rates of the third quarter. With the restructuring charges excluded, the effective income tax for the fourth quarter was 27.9% and the annual rate was 27.6%. As indicated in our press release, we initiated and completed the previously announced share repurchase programs. In total, we repurchased 17.4 million shares for $1 billion.", "And then turning to the balance sheet. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong and I'll briefly discuss certain key asset management areas.", "Accounts receivable days ended the year at 59 days. This represents an increase of three days compared to the prior year. This metric has been 59 or 60 days all year, and we believe this represents excellent performance given our geographic footprint.", "Inventory days finished 2008 at 155 days, down nine days sequentially were up 18 days versus the prior year. A number of factors including our compliance initiatives and the fourth quarter sales slowdown have left this metric a bit higher than we would like. And then last I'll end with some brief commentary on cash flow. ", "All in, we had another very strong cash flow year, cash flow from operations for the year grow 14% to 1.176 billion and free cash flow was up 22% from 841 million to 1.29 billion slightly above the amount used to repurchase shares during the year.", "With that I'll turn it back over to Steve.", "Steve MacMillan", "Thanks, Dean. Before we open it up for q-and-a, we'll touch here on our outlook. As we look at 2009, we are facing both challenges as well as opportunities. We are assuming hospital capital budget pressures will continue and foreign currency remains volatile clearly creating more uncertainty than at any time in recent memory.", "In addition, the elective procedures may see some slowdown and will continue and make ongoing investment in compliance. We know many are wondering how certain we can be in developing our plans and guidance for the year. And the truth is, it is hard to have a high degree of conviction given the environment. Against this uncertain backdrop, we are focused on what we can control, especially our costs. On the positive side, we continue to see strong momentum in many of our businesses as knees, spine, trauma as well as our CMF implant businesses are well poised to maintain their above market growth. ", "And although MedSurg will see pressure in 2009, we remain confident in the strength of the core portfolio products as well as opportunities to leverage these franchises outside the US. Additionally, our hip franchise after underperforming throughout 2008 is set to deliver improved growth, helped by new products while our endoscopy franchise is entering a major new product cycle. ", "We are also extremely focused as an organization on leveraging our P&L via cost controls. Combined, all of these factors were key considerations as we developed our budget for 2009. As stated, we expect to deliver 6% to 9% constant currency sales growth in 2009 and 10% to 14% EPS gains to 312 to 322 per share as a range. Speaking candidly, we've had a number of comments from investors over the past two weeks who feel we are overly optimistic in establishing these goals. ", "Maybe so, but those of you who know us well understand that our DNA is wired to set the bar high and achieve results that do stand out over time. So once again, we are setting aggressive goals, but we will be closely tracking the environment and our actions to deliver against these goals. We're not simply going to take a pass on 2009, because it's a challenging time. ", "It's important to recognize that results will be stronger in the second half, as the hospital capital environment, the impact of currency, our investment and compliance, and the lower investment returns are expected to limit per-share earnings growth in the first two quarters to the mid-single digit range. ", "Despite the currently challenging and uncertain economic environment, we believe we are well positioned to deliver meaningful growth in 2009 and beyond. As we move past 2009, we'll continue to make significant investments in compliance, but we'll benefit from P&L leverage and decreasing one-time costs. We also expect to begin to realize the benefit from efficiency initiatives, including vendor consolidation, streamlining back office functions, and procurement. ", "And although FX is always an unknown, we would expect that the swings in currency will be more in line with historic norms versus what we have experienced in recent months, and for hospital capital spending to eventually normalize leading to hopefully even stronger results. We'll now open it up for Q&A. We'll hand it back to you Amity. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Banc of America Securities. Please proceed.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Oh, great. Good afternoon. First, just on that comment that you made around guidance and the philosophy in DNA of Stryker, I'm just curious, couldn't you have higher goals internally than you set guidance - then the guidance, that you give to Wall Street? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "You know what, Bob. We've always tried to have internal and external goals that align. And frankly a lot it comes down too, we set our sales targets for our aggressive targets for our people, and we want to maintain ourselves to the same standards. Okay, we like having the same goals internally and externally.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Yes, just of sort of an IR question there. But...", "Dean Bergy", "We comprised to be more conservative but, just not us.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "So if I look at the guidance that you gave for '09, it looks like you're assuming mid-to-high single-digit growth for MedSurg and number one, is that right? And number two, since you gave that guidance, maybe roughly three, or four weeks ago, now the trends you are seeing at hospitals sort of stayed the same or gotten little better or gotten little worse?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Say overall, we haven't seen any real change in the trends over just the last few weeks. We are obviously staying very close to them and I think ultimately, we'll know a lot more I think after the first quarter comes through. ", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "Am I right about what you're assuming for MedSurg somewhere in that mid to high-single digit range for that overall MedSurg business?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yeah. As you know we don't give too much specific guidance to that effect, but I think that's in the range.", "Katherine Owen", "And, Bob, again this is a follow-up, keep in mind, given that the year is backend loaded, part of that is going to be a more of a MedSurg phenomenon?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed. ", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Thank you. I have ten questions, I'll try and narrow it down here. First off, thank you for the candid comments, Steve, I think they were all appreciated. Let me do follow up that one, on some of the questions that Bob was asking, and I think we are interested in the way the macro environment is evolving and impacting businesses. ", "Your orthopedic business held up very well, orthopedic industry held up very well, and your knee business held up very well in the fourth quarter. Are we seeing any drop off procedure volumes in your mind in the first quarter? It's obviously just a few weeks into it, but any thoughts that maybe procedures were pulled into the fourth quarter, people were trying to use up their FSAs and trying to take advantage of their deductibles they had worked through them already?", "Stephen MacMillan", "You know it looks over the last few years like that's increasingly happened and I know you've been looking at the seasonality of that. We're kind of assuming some of that, but again it is pretty early in the quarter. I think overall, for all the talk that's out there, about procedural slowdown and you certainly see some pockets, I don't think we see anything dropping off the face of the earth here.", "Katherine Owen", "I would just add -- there is kind of two things going on. The slowdown on the capital spending cycle is very real and we've got a lot of data points obviously to bake that into our expectations. The elective procedures side is more something that we've considered in our budgeting as a possibility as opposed to anything that's showing up in any clear way right now that you could draw any trend. So far, Q4 was very much in line with historic norms recognizing a little bit tougher comps and one less selling day. ", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "And then, let me ask two other questions. One, Katherine, you described the compliance initiative as being in your of two of a three-year initiative, and I don't think that I've heard you guys describe it that way before where this is a three-year playout. And we're now entering year two of it. ", "So, I want to make sure we're thinking about the spend levels as we go from 2009 to 2010 correctly. Obviously it's still early in that process, and I want to make sure we are thinking about that [play]. And then second, I want to come back to the question of use of cash. You said you guys bought back a $1 billion worth of stock, which is obviously a very sizable amount. We talk about use of cash from here. Do you have an authorization in place to repurchase additional stock if you choose to do so? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "That was sort of two questions but--", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "That was more than two. I tried.", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah. I'll give you that. I guess a couple of points. The first one, we did talk a couple of weeks ago about the compliance program that year two was really or 2009 with year two of a three-year cycle, or of a three year process. It's going to go on beyond three years, but the primary kind of key investment, the major investments we're making across the organization we have laid out in a three-year plan, and so year two was really the peak investment year spend of that three-year. ", "We're having more costs next year, but in terms of incremental investment, the hope would be they would not be above 2009 levels. And then, beyond that we'll have ongoing investments with these kind of one-time costs that are captured in this three-year time frame. That's what we're talking about in a two out of three-year initiative.", "Dean Bergy", "Yeah. On a cash Mike, we do not have an additional authorization in place. Certainly, it's something that could be used. Our preferred use of cash would continue to be acquisitions first still and obviously we've got a number of things that we could potentially look at there.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Perfect. Thank you, guys.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Hello, Raj?", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Sorry about that had the phone on mute. I was curious, if I could ask little about the Department of Justice. My understanding is the monitoring initiatives are going to end here at the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter. How should we think about that? I mean, are you expecting any major change in anything should that [monitoring] come to a close and is there also a possibility that it won't end then it might get extended further?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Well, I don't think we have much evidence that would suggest it's going to continue on, but I think there has been a fundamental shift in this industry. And I would expect not significant changes afterwards. I know there's some investors out there that think okay, all of a sudden it's going to be the wild west come April 1st. I think, we've all learned that would not behoove us to us be going and changing and I think most of the companies have really put in much more rigorous systems in terms of needs assessments and everything else, and that there probably won't be much change.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then, if I could just ask one on the SG&A. You know the margin in the quarter was quite good. I think, it's the best we've seen for a couple of years and I think you've in the past talked about there being a lot more margin there still in it, 38.2%, I mean, are we looking at that number declining significantly again here in '09 or just sort of thoughts on where that number could actually get to overtime?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure. We probably don't [feeling this] little bit target to going down. I would say the way we're thinking about it right now is in the good times when we were really generating clearly solid double-digit growth, we kept saying, hey, we maybe making additional investments in additional sales force expansion, other things. I would say what you saw in the fourth quarter is we got wind particularly that last week of October when we saw orders not typically come in.", "We reined things in pretty tightly. And I think we've got enough resources on the ground that continue to drive us here for final, but our typical headcount expansions and some of that stuff, we really reined in. So I think the fourth quarter is probably a signal of more things to come here in the first few quarters until things pick back up.", "Dean Bergy", "If I could just add to that briefly, I think obviously, we said there could continue to be some gross margin pressure. So, I think it's fair to say for the year that you could see SG&A still down. We still got some room there, but as Steve said I think we also want to be sensitive to where the business is. And keep in mind, that on a quarterly basis, usually the first quarter is a higher SG&A quarter, and although I would expect it to be down year-over-year, I would not use the fourth quarter as a proxy for what you're going to see in the first quarter in terms of percentage of sales spending.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good evening, everyone. And thank you for taking the question. Just Steve, if you could cross the different businesses, there were several areas where you posted growth way above market rate. Can you maybe talk a little bit about what's happening in either the knee market or instruments market of what's driving the outside growth? Is it volume, mix, share gain, et cetera?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure. I think within knees, it's all of the above. Clearly, our Triathlon knee has by all standards turned out to be a great, great knee. And we continue to gain new customers on that even well into what the fourth year of the product life cycle and the accolades on that continue to be very strong. So I think we're feeling great about that.", "I think our instruments business continues to bring new products out and expand essentially our share of the operating room. I think it's why we continue to be underlying, you know have a lot of bullish feelings despite the current challenges that there is still so much opportunity challenges and so much underlying momentum in a number of our businesses that even if the markets slow down a few points, we should still be able to post have decent growth. It won't be up to our historic norms, but it will still be solid by probably most people's measures.", "David Roman - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Then on the $60 million to $90 million increment or spending for next year or this year on quality, could you give us some sense on how that flows through the P&L, maybe, some trajectory on gross margins and SG&A for next year?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure. Dean, you want to take that?", "Dean Bergy", "Sure. Yeah. The majority of those costs will go through the cost of sales line. So again, as I said, I think that on margins, we would expect them to be flattish to down slightly as a percentage of sales for the year, although obviously for the first quarter, they're going to be down from what was a very, very strong first quarter in gross margin in 2008.", "In SG&A, as I said, I think we do have some room to continue to see that come down as a percentage of sales, maybe in the 50 to 100 basis point range for the year.", "Operator", "Again, we ask that participants limit their questions to one question and one follow-up. Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of UBS Securities. Please proceed.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Securities", "Thanks. Steve or Dean, could you speak just generally to the differential performance in the MedSurg categories, is it just the size of the CapEx expenditures the hospitals have to make that kind of explains the differential performance?", "And looking out into '09, because this is a tough to model space, could you just kind of at least qualitatively contrast what we've seen this quarter, at least relatively amongst the groups, will that extend in the MedSurg groups? Will that extend to 2009?", "Katherine Owen", "I'll give a couple of points, Bruce. You are correct in that. In certain of the businesses medical being the most and instruments being the least on more capital intensive then other would be overall split still being in that kind of 60/40 range. So that certainly has an impact.", "I'd also layer on top of that though, endoscopy, which actually saw the greatest pressure was also coming towards the tail end of product life cycle. And as we've showed before that you see most of the volatility, endoscopy's growth has historically been tied less to capital budget more so right now given the environment that we're in, but it's very much impacted by new product launches.", "And when we launch our major new camera like we just did a few weeks ago, that has a bigger impact traditionally. So, it really had two factors weighing on it, one throughout most of the year and then certainly in the fourth quarter compounded by capital budget.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Securities", "But specifically looking at endoscopy, which was down 2% operationally and patient handling which was 7%, I mean, are those kind of representative of kind of the run rates we might see in this extraordinary period or would you expect improvement endoscopy at least, towards mid-single digits or even higher?", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah. We're not going to get into line item detail in terms of the projection for the full year. We did made comments, that you should expect [orthoto] be stronger, obviously than MedSurg. MedSurg will be more back-end loaded. We do expect growth within the MedSurg business throughout the year.", "I wouldn't necessarily read too much into the fourth quarter. There's difference quarter-to-quarter in terms of yearend capital budgets seasonality, timing of product cycles, year-over-year comparisons all of which will have an impact on the growth rate. We would expect endoscopy to be more back-end loaded, partly because of the capital budget but also because of the comp that we'll have in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the gradual benefit it will realize from the product cycle launch with the endoscopy, the 1288 camera and the related products.", "But beyond that we're not going to get into too much granularity. I think the good news is we're able to track what's going on with capital budgets a lot better. We've got a lot more information from our key customers. We get that on a weekly basis now. Things have not continued to deteriorate rapidly, but it's obviously not at a point where capital budgets are improving. So that's the environment we're in, but I would not necessarily extrapolate Q4 rates into Q1.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ed Shenkan with Needham & Company. Please proceed.", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "Thank you. I just wanted to ask you your comment that you said elective procedures may see a slowdown, what areas might you expect to see the slowdown first? Would it be domestically, internationally, would it be hips, knees, or spine?", "Katherine Owen", "The short answer is don't know. We're talking about something we're not sure is going to happen. I don't think there is a big difference between hip and knee procedures in terms if you're going to make a decision to delay a procedure. I am not sure it's different whether it's a hip or knee or spine, they're all elective to a degree. But the reality is patients with this kind of debilitating pain really have to have the procedure done.", "So could we see a quarter or two, where there is a slowdown in any one of those three buckets because people are concerned about co-pays or taking time off work is entirely possible. We think it's prudent to assume that in some of our budgeting, which is why we did come up with the range. And you can make assumptions as to what that the lower end of that sales range.", "The U.S. versus overseas, there are some differences. Obviously, nationalized healthcare and what some of the spending will do. I think the bigger issue is probably domestic, but I wouldn't assume. It's completely different. Beyond that, it's hard to give you granularity as to which procedure may see a slowdown before a different one.", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "Does the average age for the procedures, do you think that would make the impact compared to if it's a Medicare procedure maybe it's less at risk?", "Katherine Owen", "It really depends. If you are a Medicare patient, you are going to have anything from nothing to a couple thousand dollars of out-of-pocket expenses depending on what type of additional coverage Medigap coverage you have or whether or not you've already had a procedure done through the year, that's going to eat up that.", "On the private side, which is probably another big chunk, obviously not the majority, it's really going to depend whether your inside, your provider network outside of it, the magnitude of co-pays vary dramatically. Do you opt to have this procedure done if you are one of the two million people out of work right now before your COBRA goes away? There's a lot of compounding factors, right now, that I don't think you can make a big determination whether or not if the slowdown happens, if it will be Medicare or non-Medicare specific.", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "And last, is it then in your guidance that there would be a slowdown or is that not part of the guidance?", "Katherine Owen", "What we've tried to reflect in the 6% to 9% revenue range is assumptions at the low end, which obviously assumes a tougher capital environment and have taken some appropriate cautious guidance around elected procedures and then there is the high end of the range. We've made assumptions into both that's captured in that 6% to 9%.", "Stephen MacMillan", "The simple perspective here is look we just grew 11% local currency in 2008. We're saying the low end is 6%, almost half that in 2009. So, hopefully, that should frame in. Our 6% to 9%, remember, is a significant haircut from what we've been doing over the last few years.", "The additional, you know, uncertainty, there is uncertainty. We can't tell you exactly by quarter which business is going to do exactly what. And by the way, even in our best years, you know, remember when we go back and look at our final results for a year, it doesn't exactly mimic by quarter what we predicted for every business, but collectively our diverse footprint, always seems to come through. Some of the businesses come in higher, some are little lower. And again, I think, we're trying to manage it as we can here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "Thank you. Could you tell us what you are assuming for foreign exchange headwind in 2009? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "It's going to be all over the place. ", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "I mean in your guidance sir, on the six to nine.", "Dean Bergy", "It's in the press release. ", "Katherine Owen", "69% Joanne is constant currency.", "Dean Bergy", "That's constant currency, so--", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "Understood. But I mean, assuming 500 basis points of FX, headwind is 300 basis points that's really what I am asking?", "Dean Bergy", "Yes. There's an unfavorable impact of 3.5% to 4.5% that we would assume would be, you know a headwind, given the current rates and again that's a reduction of that 6% to 9% constant currency growth.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "Okay. When -- take a look at your spine business, it's growing above the market growth rate? Could you give us an idea of what is driving that growth and can you also give us an update on artificial disks. Thank you.", "Stephen MacMillan", "What's driving it is great products and great sales people. We think, we've quietly built an incredibly strong sales organization and we've fed them a lot of new product innovations over the last few years. We really rounded out the bag. But it's a dynamic team, just a dynamic team that we have there with a lot of momentum and we expect that to continue. ", "On the artificial disks, we're essentially waiting for the -- I'm sorry, for the FlexiCore we're in the process. We are hopefully having that, on the market potentially later this year. It's in with FDA going through the some of the inspections and some of the other stuff, and then CerviCore I think we are still thinking as later on in 2010.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, Good afternoon.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Hi, Tao.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Hey. A quick question on the CapEx changes that you are seeing, so when you have the dialogue with the hospitals, what are they saying is causing them to delay the purchase and sort of what are they waiting to see to reconnect and sort of purchase a new suite or some new products on the CapEx side? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "It varies all over the place. Remind you, there were some hospitals that had their bond offerings to go through and frankly we are in pretty good shape from a capital standpoint. Our job is to find more of those. There are other ones that what's really happening in a lot of cases is, it really in that October timeframe, a lot of the CEOs -- we're looking around whether it was their endowments or their capital budgets in general and just starting to put in either arbitrary cuts or arbitrary holes and it literally is all over the map. ", "We're getting weekly updates from our teams in the field particularly in the US and they just are all over the place in terms of how long they expect them to continue. What levels they are at in terms of how far down they are going. And, I think just in general we are assuming there's going to be less capital spent certainly in 2009 than what people would have been planning six months ago. ", "Having said that, there's still going to be money spent and I think our job is, if you look, I think six out of our eight business is probably seven out of our eight businesses, we've been growing at faster than the market last year. Our charge to our teams is there still going to be money spent. We've got to get more than our fair share going forward.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "But no sort of single event or anything we're kind of waiting for whether it's anything in government side? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "You know I think in general, I think too many people are looking for single events. I think it's going to ultimately let's face it housing come back, but jobs are going continue to get worse. It's a hard time to plan. I know we'd love to give you more definitive answers on a lot of this stuff. Anybody that's giving you definitive answers, I don't think, knows what they're talking about. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Wachovia Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Hi. I had a yet another question on the hip business. Steve, I think you mentioned that you're launching some new products there. I was wondering if you could tell us what those products are and if not, I guess one of them that we're aware of is the tritanium cups. Just wondering on the timing of that launch, and if there's any additional instruments that will have to be placed in the field? In other words, how quickly can that really ramp up?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Tritanium is really ramping up now. That is what we're talking about particularly, and that was a fourth quarter launch rolling out and starting to get some traction. I would also tell you, I think our sales force has been so focused on knees because we've been having so much success there, that I think part of our hip business has lagged a little bit from that. But I think tritanium will get folks talking about hips again a little bit. It still not -- we're not going to generate the kind of growth that we'll have on knees this year. But it should certainly start to pick up.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "Okay. And then just with regards to the guidance range for EPS, how much would currency have to move before it would push you out of that range?", "Stephen MacMillan", "[Probably] Dean -- beyond what we put in the release, largely I would you say?", "Dean Bergy", "Yeah I mean, obviously, we gauged our guidance around the FX numbers that we've put in the release, and so I think you can naturally assume that movements outside of that could potentially impact but there's a lot of, you know there's a lot of factors that go into that. Right now, we've assumed that the negative impact on our FX for the full year will be in the kind of the $0.10 to $0.15 range generally.", "Katherine Owen", "The only thing I'd add onto that is I wouldn't make any huge conclusions if currency rates move demonstrably outside that range if that happens, because this is a big company with a lot of items that are fluctuating whether it's commodity prices or legal costs or whatever it is. So these things can't really be isolated and assume that movement in isolation can -- you could draw down so that means extra earnings.", "Dean Bergy ", "Yeah. And I think, the other thing that's fair to say in that regard is there is a lot of currencies that are moving here. I referenced, you know, the British pound, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollars are all currencies that are also moving around here, and when you look at all the cross currency impacts, it's actually very complex in trying to put your arms around it.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "All right. Appreciate the clarification. Thanks.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Hi, everybody. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Hi, Matt.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "I have two and I do have a clarification, I'd love to try to squeeze in here, Dean, on one of your comments during the call. The first going back to the top, Steve, you had talked about guidance and having some conversations with some folks on the street who don't think that you're going to be able to hit your guidance or feel that you maybe being overly optimistic. Can you talk a little bit about, you know, whether you being optimistic that the street is not you think or investors aren't aware, where do you think that the strength is going to be potentially, areas of upside that maybe we're not understanding?", "Dean Bergy", "Sure. I think to me the big picture comment is people saying, everybody is writing off 2009, why don't you guys do the same? And again, it comes back to the fact, I think we've got a lot of positive momentum and the biggest piece is I'll give you this. Think about our MedSurg businesses. Yes we're going to hit some capital hiccups here in the United States.", "We've been making efforts to expand that business outside the United States. And frankly, those businesses are still roughly three-quarters of those businesses today are in the US. We have very low market shares outside the US. You know, now is the year that we hope that some of what we've been doing over the last couple of years will help us to effectively cushion some of the downside. ", "And I think you saw that in the fourth quarter when we put out our, I think when we put out in mid December our update on the numbers for the fourth quarter. I think everybody thought MedSurg was going fall completely apart, and if you looked at it, yeah, we had two businesses that were negative in the US in the quarter, but they both had double-digit growth outside the US. ", "So it gets back to in any given quarter, we always have a few things that surprise us on the upside, either geographically or by franchise and invariably we have a few things that disappoint us. But collectively, the numbers still seem to come through pretty well that we're growing at or above our markets in virtually every area.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. That's helpful. Second question, and again, I do have one clarification I'd like to sneak in. The second question is that on this hospital spending front, Katherine, you mentioned a lot of data points, a lot of people have recognized there's pressure there. I'm trying to understand and it will be helpful if you could shed some light on, to what degree is, the certain amount of belt tightening and cash conservation that's going on in hospitals. ", "But then, there's also this element of just new hospital construction that has been put on hold or stopped or significantly curtailed. And so, I'd love to understand to what degree those drive your business and then also to what degree maybe they are a factor going forward O.U.S. as well?", "Kurt Hartman", "Matt this is Kurt Hartman. Let me try and take a stab of that question just stepping out of an operating business. Certainly at the street level, we are focused on existing hospital as well as new construction opportunities and given the current environment, some of those new construction opportunities have obviously slowing down. But you have to keep in mind that the procedure volume that's out there that creates the wear and tear and equipment has not fundamentally disappeared. ", "It may slow slightly, depending on elective procedure trends, but that use of equipment, that constant cycling of equipment does place an emphasis on new equipment replacement and purchases and certainly we're going to pursue that as aggressively as possible, even if new constructions segments of the market do slowdown ", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. And on the O.U.S. side of this, at this point right now, I recognize you're building out that side of your business particularly, in beds for example. Is that at risk down the road? Are we concerned at all that US is a capital spending problem now and that may go overseas from the next six to twelve months?", "Kurt Hartman", "I don't think we would say it couldn't go overseas. I think what we would say based on Steve's comment was, our percentage of MedSurg's outside the US is fairly small at this time. So any slowdown there should not have an overly meaningful impact on our results. And frankly, we see more opportunity there because we have so much opportunity to go capture market share. ", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "And may be penetration is in your favor there. And then, the last point just to clarify, Dean, you made a comment during your talking through the P&L about slowing instrument amortization expense, sort of easing on the SG&A line. Could you just explain that?", "Dean Bergy", "Yeah. You know, the instruments are basically -- you know, the instruments that we buy and provide to generally the hospitals to support orthopedic implant procedures, and, you know, the timing of our spend there tends to revolve around not only the cost of the instruments but also the timing of launches of products. ", "And you know, just given where we've been, when we had the Triathlon launch, and we had a significant [vols] of instruments that went into the field and that was a huge launch. In relative terms, we've been able to control the level of instruments that have went into the field much at a slower pace in the last couple of years and therefore that rate of amortization on that number started to slowdown.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Great.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "Good afternoon, everybody. A big picture question then an operating question. On the acquisition front, Steve, should we think given the greater availability and possibly more attractive pricing that acquisitions or an acquisition is more likely this year or is it less likely given all the challenges you're facing in preferring to focus internally? ", "Stephen MacMillan ", "Probably more likely, Rick but because we like reevaluations are coming. Having said that, we continue to be in a real good position of strength with our underlying business, so we're not going to race out and just jump in to something. But, we like where the valuations are moving frankly, like having the cash that we have right now. ", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "And on the, back to MedSurg, on the O.U.S. instrument front, I'm not sure, I picked up if you mentioned, I apologize if you did. O.U.S. was down, I think 8% -- I forget, reported or operationally. Just can you remind us, what's going on there and what and when you might turn that around?", "Stephen MacMillan ", "Yeah. I think it's a one-quarter blip. It looks like our European business had a great fourth quarter '07. And I think they fell asleep at the end of fourth quarter of '08. And we also did have as I think Dean mentioned, a recall on System 6 that affected us at the start of the quarter. So we didn't quite make that back up. But we're back in business there. So nothing I think to be too concerned about. ", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "Some more normal, back to more normal performance?", "Stephen MacMillan ", "Should be, yes. Yeah.", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "All right. Thank you.", "Stephen MacMillan ", "Thanks, Rick.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird. Please proceed.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Thank you. Good evening. Steve or Dean, I guess, wondering if you could talk qualitatively just on flexibility on the expense side of your model. How low could constant currency growth go before you'd really start sweating out maybe the lower end of your EPS guidance and I don't expect a direct answer there, but maybe just qualitatively if you could frame that for us?", "Stephen MacMillan ", "I'll let Dean handle that one. I sweat over everything. ", "Dean Bergy", "Well, obviously I mean we've given you ranges and we feel comfortable with those when we know this is probably as fluid a market as we've ever been in. And we're going to have to manage our business, but as Steve said throughout his comments, we take our objectives and goals very, very seriously in this company and I think you should assume that's going to be the case and obviously going to be managing the business as we go through the year.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Fair enough", "Stephen MacMillan ", "We're more focused on cost than we've ever been and yet it's a fine line, because we still have a lot of growth. We don't want to choke off additional growth, so what we're trying to do is stay very close to our key leaders around the company in terms of managing our costs, but also investing where we still have the opportunities to grow, but really paying much closer attention to details right now.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Sure, understood, Steve. I guess my question is more, there -- is there anything in the bag where we could cut this back if we absolutely have to, but right now we're not going to necessarily unless we really need a few more pennies to bottom line something like that? ", "Katherine Owen", "I would say from a big pictures perspective, no. If the environment continues to worsen dramatically, I think you'll see a whole host of companies re-evaluating priorities and costs. Right now, we feel good that based on everything we know, recognizing there's uncertainty, the 6% to 9% range [marries up] well with 312 to the 322 that we've outlined.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Fair enough. And then just a clarification I guess, Dean, shipping rates, commodity costs coming down in that, is that more of a backend of the year type benefit that we might start to expect to see a little bit?", "Dean Bergy ", "It's certainly possible. Freight rates as I mentioned in my overall comments stayed pretty high in the fourth quarter and we certainly hope that, you know, shipping costs and commodity are things that we can start to see squeeze down in appropriate reaction as we go throughout the year, but probably not necessarily starting the year. There are people tend to try to hold on to increases that they've gotten there and it's our job to work them down.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "Understood. Thanks, guys. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel, Cowen and Company. Please proceed.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Hi, good afternoon. It looks like things like the Sunshine Act and some other government initiatives to increase price transparency and in general control healthcare costs are may be gaining a little bit more momentum heading into the year. There's also been some new data points albeit somewhat anecdotal suggesting that hospital administrators are gaining some traction in managing implant and vendor selection. ", "I was just curious, if you have any thoughts on any of these dynamics and specifically what pricing assumptions for Recon are incorporated into your guidance?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Doug, we're facing these pressures all the time. They've been building over the last few years. We continue to deal with them on a daily basis as we go through things. The Sunshine Act, you know, remember is focused more on physician payment, disclosure of physician payment as opposed to pricing. ", "Now there is obviously a link back. We certainly see the hospital's more focused here. We continue to try to bring value to the game and as we, the last couple of years we have effectively had zero percent price increase around the world, see that continuing to be pressured.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Okay. And one, I guess a second question. And it may seem a bit silly given what we know is going on in terms of the hospital capital spending environment, but you did mention that endoscopy also struggled in part in the fourth quarter because of maybe anticipation of the launch of the new product line. If so, is there any chance that there may be at least a smidge or pent up demand for some of those products heading into the first quarter? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "It's a very good question. There's probably a smidge, and I think in any other year, I would tell you any other year with the product line up, we just launched in our Endoscopy division our endo business would grow 20% this year. But, there is such wide variation right now, that even if there is a little pent up, it's, I think we're being cautious in assuming it's going to be really slow coming out of the gates. ", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Okay, thanks for taking the questions.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Hi, good after. Thanks for taking the question. I just want to clarify on the warning letters, did you say that you expect to have them resolved in 2009 or just your facilities ready for inspection in 2009.", "Katherine Owen", "The goal would be to have them resolved in 2009. ", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And then a just kind of more big picture. I think your 2010 and beyond goals that you outlined a couple weeks ago were for about 10% constant currency and 15% plus EPS growth. Do you feel like you have the right mix of business right now? How important will acquisitions be to furthering those goals? And I guess what gives you confidence that we're seeing in the market with the pressures from CapEx will just be more of a one-year sort of phenomenon? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure, I think we do feel good about our mix of businesses today that we would be able to deliver that in more normative times. The hospital CapEx stuff, it's going to come back. The other part is, even with hospital capital expenditures slower, there's still a lot of spending going into healthcare. ", "And, we still have very low market shares. There is still significant opportunities for us to frankly take share in every market we compete in. And I think that's what has us feel good. Having said that to your acquisition question, Kristen, I think we'll continue to look for additional businesses, particularly ones that are in our real house and continue to try to build out our platform and probably broaden it in years ahead.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And I guess, just on the acquisition front, are you still looking more on the smaller side or would you be willing to do a bigger deal that establishes some sort of new franchise. And dental was one area in the past, when you typically look at acquisitions, are you looking on several years to maybe to recover that sort of dynamics?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We'd consider some things that could bring new platforms to us, which would be bigger by, you know, some standards but we're not going to do any absolute game changer that puts us into a heavy debt position or anything like that.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And your tolerance for the dilution in the past, I think you characterized that as reasonably low or how do you think about that? ", "Stephen MacMillan", "Again, ultimately it's going come down return on capital and how we think about staff. Certainly a year one dilution, we'd be willing to do if it's the right thing and probably even in the year two if it made sense. We want to avoid, huge long-term dilutions but ultimately it's going to [get down] to also just the return on capital. And we continue to be very, very disciplined as you know. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Adams. Please proceed.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "Hi, thank you. Seemed to be last and most of these lately. Simple question, just on the monitoring cost, as those roll off in April -- as those cost go away, one, can you quantify that? And two does that spending just get shifted to the COGS line for your compliance [this year] or compliance programs?", "Dean Bergy", "You know Bill, I will take that one. The reality is there is as Steve talked about, I mean we along with other companies have changed at least on the insight of lot of what we have done to manage our business here. And there is a lot of those costs that have an ongoing impact. ", "So there's not a, I wouldn't say there's going to be a significant amount of costs that are going to roll off. Obviously there is some external costs that will probably help us a bit. But, I think in terms if you look at our overall cost of compliance we've included in there, we're not looking that as being a real savings opportunities going forward at this point.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Adams", "And are there any, like, closing costs associated with that one-time charges or a big check that you have to cut when that monitor rolls off?", "Dean Bergy", "No. ", "Stephen MacMillan", "We hope not unless they hit us with a final bill. Yeah, office decorations maybe. Great, well thanks, Bill for that final question and with that our conference call for our first quarter 2009 operating results will be held on April 20th, 2009. We'll ask everyone to also hold a place on your calendars for our 2009 analyst meeting, which will be held on May 20th in New York City.

(Operator instructions)", "Certain statements made in today's conference call may constitute forward-looking statements. They will be based upon management's current expectations and will be subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. In addition to factors that may be discussed in this call, such factors include, but are not limited to: further weakening of economic conditions that could adversely affect the level of demand for the company's products, pricing pressures generally including cost containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the company's products, changes in foreign exchange market, regulatory actions, unanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and otherwise that affect United States Food and Drug Administration approval of new products, changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payors, a significant increase in product liability claims, unfavorable resolution of income tax audits, changes in financial markets, and changes in the competitive environment. Additional information concerning these and other factors are contained in the company's filing with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's Annual Report on Form-10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. ", "Today's conference call will also include a discussion of constant currency sales performance and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2008. Further, discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures including GAAP reconciliations that appears in the company's Form 8-K filed today with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, which may be accessed from the For Investors page on the company's website at www.stryker.com. ", "I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Mr. Stephen MacMillan, President and CEO of Stryker.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Stryker's first quarter 2009 earnings report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "As many of you are aware, Curt assumed the role of CFO effective April 1, 2009, although he has been working closely with both Dean Bergy and our finance team since the latter part of 2008. Certainly some fun times for Curt to join in that role. ", "Turning to the review of our quarterly results, 2009 has thus far presented us with some challenges but we\u2019ve also achieved a few noteworthy successes. We believe these achievements are particularly impressive in light of the current economic environment.", "Looking at the quarter we note the following highlights:", "Despite the unprecedented global economic slowdown six of our eight key product franchises delivered mid-single to low-double-digit constant currency revenue growth, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model;", "Strong cost controls throughout the organization, as evidenced by the 1.5% reduction in SG&A as a percent of sales, despite ongoing selective investments in our sales forces;", "Ongoing benefit from our geographic footprint as evidenced by the fact that although in the U.S. our endoscopy and medical franchises were under pressure in the quarter, both posted solid mid-teens growth internationally;", "Continued strength of our balance sheet with our total cash and marketable securities balance totaling $2.2 billion;", "The successful launch of a number of important new products, including the Q1 roll out of our endoscopy 1288 camera, wireless monitor, and light source;", "Expansion of our medical division\u2019s footprint with our latest entry into the U.S. surfaces market via the launch of our Impression offering; and", "The successful completion of the Department of Justice\u2019s 18-month monitoring period, which was completed on March 27.", "To be fair, Q1 also presented us with some disappointments, most notably our decision to revise downward our full-year sales and earnings guidance as the capital environment has proven more challenging than we expected at the start of the year.", "However, it\u2019s worth noting that although hospital capital budgets remain under pressure, we have started to see some encouraging signs of customers looking to resume capital purchases. Much of this is still anecdotal and we would remain appropriately cautious regarding the near-term outlook for the roughly 25% of our revenue base that\u2019s tied to capital purchases. But it does suggest the cycle may be bottoming.", "Overall, we are encouraged by our Q1 results and our ability to sustain top line growth despite the economic conditions, while also continuing to invest heavily in our compliance initiative and new product launches.", "And the actions we undertook in Q4, when the first signs of the market slowdown appeared, to aggressively implement meaningful cost controls have had considerable impact and should allow us to deliver solid earnings growth for 2009.", "Meanwhile, our growing cash balances and the overall strength of our balance sheet uniquely position us to capitalize on potential opportunities. With Q1 now under our belts, which we suspect will be the most challenging quarter of 2009, we feel well poised to deliver on our commitments for the year.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "I would like to provide an update and some perspective on three topics that have been the focus of a number of questions from the investor community, specifically: one, reconstructive implant pricing and elective procedure trend; two, hospital capital budgets; and thirdly, the outlook for OP-1.", "First, with respect to recon implant practice, there has been some speculation that the current economic environment will drive greater downward pressure on implant prices. We have actually seen similar concerns in the past with various factors serving as the catalyst for the core \u201cimminent\u201d collapse implant pricing, including gain sharing, national account contracting, the DOJ investigation, the DOJ settlement, and more recently, the economic environment.", "However, despite these events, reconstructive ASPs have been relatively stable since 2004, decreasing at roughly 1% to 2% annually, although this has been largely offset by more favorable pricing for spine and trauma. Part of the lack of meaningful downward pressure on recon implants is tied to the favorable reimbursement trends in recent years, including the severity of adjusted index that allows for higher reimbursement for more challenging patients such as those often seen at teaching hospitals.", "Admittedly there are pockets where we have seen greater pressure of late and we expect that trend will continue. However, we continue to see solid up ticks for premium-priced products such as our X3 poly and the recently launch titanium hip cuff, indicating physician preference for products that provide a value-add to patients.", "As we have discussed throughout the quarter we have seen some pockets in the U.S. where there has been a delay in elective procedures, primarily with non-Medicare patients owing to the economic environment. Given that it\u2019s typically the debilitating pain that drives a patient to undergo reconstructive surgery, we suspect a deferral of surgery will last months and not years, moreover towards emphasizing that the overall impact in these isolated delays on our recon business have been relatively modest, as that business was still up 6% operationally in Q1, which is not meaningfully off from the 7% to 9% secular growth rate for the industry.", "Put another way, despite the unprecedented economic environment the compelling clinical results from joint replacement for patients, coupled with the importance of this procedure for hospitals, is evident in the ability of this market to continue to sustain solid revenue growth.", "Turning to hospital capital budgets, although the backdrop remains tough, we are seeing some early signs that have heretofore not existed, suggesting some hospitals are looking to resume purchases of critical products. We would emphasize the importance of not overestimating either the speed of the recovery or how quickly these early signs will translate into a meaningful rebound in revenue as we expect this to translate into first, stabilization in the year-over-year declines in our capital businesses, followed by a gradual acceleration.", "But beyond the timing of a recovery in the hospital capital markets, we remain committed to our ongoing strategy of expanding our footprint and entering adjacent markets. For example, our medical franchise has broadened its offering in the U.S. purchases market with the recent launch of Impression, our first meaningful product introduction in the roughly 400.0 million replacement services segment, a category that is growing in the high single digits, a process that will increasingly migrate in this for-purchase product.", "This strategy is incrementally expanding our patient handling franchise, allows us to capture market share, and helps blunt the impact of the overall slowdown in the capital purchases market. Put more simply, although there is pressure on the market, our share of the market continues to expand.", "With respect to Point 3 and the outlet for OP-1 we are clearly disappointed by the non-favorable FDA panel recommendation that we received late last month. Given the long-term history of this product\u2019s use and patients under our various existing indications, we [inaudible] its safety and efficacy. ", "We are reviewing a variety of options available to us, recognizing we do have a base of customers, including patients and physicians, that rely on this product and that\u2019s an important consideration. ", "And we are encouraged by our early clinical results evaluation OP-1\u2019s efficacy in soft tissue. We expect to report back to you in relatively short order with more specifics regarding our strategic plan for OP-1 but in the interim while this process remains underway we will defer any additional comments.", "With that I will now turn it over to Curt to provide a more detailed financial update.", "Curt Hartman", "I will start this afternoon with the discussion of the considerable impact that foreign currency had on our first quarter sales. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar in the majority of our overseas markets reduced international sales by $87.0 million in the quarter and reduced the company\u2019s overall sales growth by 5.3%.", "Trying to the score the magnitude of the note that this dollar amount is approximately equivalent to the entire gain recognized in 2008 from currency and is approximately $20.0 million greater than the adverse impact noted in the fourth quarter.", "Unfavorable currency movements in the quarter versus last year included the dollar strengthening approximately 15% against the Euro, 38% against the British pound, and 36% against the Australian dollar. The dollar did weaken approximately 11% against the yen when compared to prior-year rates.", "If currency rates hold near current levels we expect foreign currency will decrease second quarter sales by approximately 5.5% to 6% when compared to 2008. At these rates the full-year impact will be in a range of 3.5% to 4.5% when compared to 2008.", "Next I will spend a moment on the impact of price and volume on the top line. In the quarter, selling prices across the company were essentially flat on a worldwide basis despite a 7% pricing decline in Japan. As a reminder, the Japan pricing decline is tied primarily to the reimbursement cuts introduce in April of 2008.", "On the volume mix side, growth was 4% in first quarter, which had one less selling day compared to the prior year. Volume mix was generally as expected for our orthopaedic implant products but volumes were off considerably for endoscopy and medical businesses, particularly in the U.S. market. Overall, our domestic volume mix growth was 1% in the quarter and international volume mix growth came in at 8%.", "Now I will turn to the product categories. Product growth detail has been provided in our press release and I will reference those rates as I provide more detail on our key segment performance metrics.", "For this discussion I will start with our orthopaedic implants, which represented 61% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of orthopaedic implants were flat in the quarter on a reported basis and grew by 6% in constant currency.", "Our hip business was down 2% as reported in dollars but up 6% operationally in the first quarter on a global basis. The modest acceleration in growth from both prior-year and Q4-levels was expected given the comparables. The Trident and X3 lines paced our growth on a global basis. As a reminder, the Trident\u2019s [prior] issue of 2008 began late in the first quarter with the largest sales impact being felt in March through June timeframe.", "In the U.S. hip sales were up 3% in the quarter. X3 poly delivered the largest gain and was drawing by our Trident and restoration modular hip system. Our sequential growth rate increase 3% over the fourth quarter.", "International hip sales delivered a nice quarter, increasing 9% operationally. Our European hip sales, the largest of our international markets, increased at a high single-digit rate. Nice gains from X3, Trident, Accolade, and the restoration modular hip revision products were offset by declines in other hip products.", "In Japan hip sales declined at low-single-digit levels on an operational basis due to the government price cuts.", "Moving to our new franchise, the company recorded sales growth of 1% in dollars and 6% in constant currency in the quarter. The U.S. knee business had a solid quarter in a somewhat slowing market, reporting growth of 8%. This growth, again, came on the strength of our Triathlon line, which as you recall, has been expanded with additional line extensions.", "Internationally, knees were up 4% on an operational basis. Europe and Pacific knee sales increased while Japan knee sales were impacted by the previously mentioned government price cuts. However, we are encouraged by the outlook, given the recent launch of the Triathlon system in Japan.", "Moving to trauma, the trauma business slowed somewhat over fourth quarter growth rates, recording a 2% gain in dollars and an 8% increase in local currency this quarter.", "U.S. trauma maintained double-digit growth at 10% and would have been 13% is military sales were excluded. This was a strong performance when considered against last year\u2019s 23% sales growth. Sales of the Gamma 3 hip fracture, foot and ankle, and upper extremity products led our U.S. trauma growth.", "International trauma sales were up 6% operationally in the quarter with Europe posting mid-single-digit constant currency growth. In Japan local currency trauma sales declined in the mid-single-digit range. On a product line basis, international trauma sales were paced by growth and hip fracture, upper extremity, and foot and ankle products.", "Our spine business recorded another solid quarter, growing 8% in dollars and 11% on an operational basis. U.S. spine sales recorded 13% growth against an exceedingly difficult prior year comparable of 25% growth. Domestic spine growth was led by inner-body and thoracal lumbar products.", "International spine sales posted operational growth of 9%, led by thoracal lumbar products, also. Japan recorded operational growth at low-double-digit levels and Europe grew at mid-single-digit levels operationally.", "Now I will turn to the MedSurg group, which represented 39% of our sales in the quarter. As you are aware, MedSurg is comprised of three kit product categories: instruments, which accounts for 18% of company sales; endoscopy, which accounts for 14% of company sales; and medical, which accounts for 7% of company sales in the quarter.", "Within MedSurg approximately 60% of sales come from capital equipment and as you are all aware, given the external environment, this made for an exciting quarter. Against this, MedSurg sales growth was down 5% as reported and off 1% on a constant currency basis. This is down from a 6% gain reported in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "Touching on the product categories, sales for the instruments line, which, as a reminder, generates approximately 40% of sales from capital equipment, reported an increase of 4% in the quarter and 8% operational growth.", "Instruments U.S. had another solid quarter with sales up 11%. The focus on products to serve markets outside of orthopaedics delivered strong results while the traditional power tool franchise did slow somewhat, owing to capital constraints. Other key disposables and service revenue also posted strong gains.", "International sales growth was softer at 3%, with Japan posting double-digit results. These gains were somewhat offset by our European results, which were essentially flat on tough year-over-year comparables and timing of some shipments into the market.", "Next is the endoscopy segment, which reported first quarter sales that were down 5% and off 1% in constant currency, despite the fact that approximately 60% of sales are up from capital equipment.", "Endoscopy U.S. sales as reported were down 7%. Strong shipments of communication suites and growth in our disposable-based business were essentially offset by the drop in video cameras and accessories. I will note that U.S. sampling of the new 1288 camera system is complete and first quarter try-outs have been well received.", "International sales remain strong and reported 16% operational growth continuing the favorable results posted in the fourth quarter. Every international market reported positive local currency growth and we continue to be encouraged by our expansion in these markets.", "Finally, I will talk about our medical products, which generate approximately 90% of sales from capital equipment.", "Globally, medical sales declined 22% in the quarter, as reported, and 18% in constant currency.", "Medical U.S. sales declined 27%, which was a bit outside of our anticipated range. Favorable news was found from increased growth in our rentals and service business but the obvious impact of declining bed and structure sales more than offset this gain.", "International sales results again delivered favorable news, posting 18% constant currency growth with positive results in both bed and structures after the big year-end finish.", "Now I will turn to the remainder of the income statement, beginning with gross margins. First quarter gross margins declined 160 basis points compared to 2008. As we have previously noted, gross margins in Q1 were impacted by significant investments in our compliance initiatives, recalling that there was very little of this spending in the year-ago quarter.", "Margins were also negatively impacted by a slowdown in some of our manufacturing plants in a response to a softer top line. Sequentially the 67.8% is a slight improvement over the second half of 2008. ", "Research and development spending was down 6% in the quarter to 5% of sales. This was at the lower end of our historical range, owing to the timing of expenditures associated with typical new product development cycles. I would note, we would expect R&D as a percent of sales to move forward from these levels over the course of the year.", "Selling, general, and administrative costs decreased 6% versus prior year and as a percentage of sales dropped a further 60 basis points over 2008 four-year results. This is primarily a result of our divisional focus on spending controls initiated fully in the fourth quarter in response to the slowing global economy.", "Despite significant progress as it relates to our cost-control efforts, given the top line pressure, operating income overall decreased 1% in the first quarter while operating margins increased to 23.7% of sales.", "Next I will provide a breakdown of the other income for the quarter. This was made up of $15.6 million of investment income offset by interest expense of $8.0 million and foreign currency transaction loss of $400,000. Clearly lower investment income in the quarter resulted from the drop in yields, which are approximately 200 basis points lower than year-ago levels.", "The company\u2019s effective income tax rate was 27.3% for the first quarter of 2009, down 80 basis points from the first quarter of last year and down 10 basis points from the 2008 full-year rate. We expect our full-year 2009 ETR to be substantially in line with our reported full-year 2008 tax rate. ", "Additionally, as noted in our press release, we are in receipt of a proposed tax adjustment from the IRS related to our cost-sharing arrangements. As indicated in our release, we intend to defend our positions vigorously and will be deferring any additional comments on this topic.", "Turning to the balance sheet, the obvious comment is that it continues to be very strong and overall there was very little change in the balance sheet from year end. Cash and marketable securities increased by approximately $50.0 million during the quarter.", "Accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 59, which represents a decrease of 1 day compared to the prior year. For the quarter, accounts receivable days averaged 58 which was similar to the fourth quarter of 2008 and 2 days below the average for the first quarter of 2008. These are in line with historical and we feel represent excellence performance given our geographic footprint.", "We have not felt any significant change in payor behavior, however in light of the current global environment we are maintaining diligent focus on this important asset.", "Days in inventory finished the quarter at 174, which was up 19 days sequentially and 12 days versus the prior year. The average days in inventory for the quarter was 165 versus the 155 average for the fourth quarter of last year and the 153 days for the same period last year.", "As a former operating executive with a manufacturing background, our inventory days are a subject of much focus. The two biggest factors impacting this number are compliance initiatives and the sales slowdown. Neither of these events are a surprise so it is fair to assume that we will get better in this category with the progress evident as 2009 unfolds.", "Next I will provide commentary on cash flow. We had another very strong quarter. Cash flow from operations grew 43% to $472.0 million and free cash flow was up 51% from $160.0 million to $242.0 million. This increase was predominantly driven by lower working capital requirements. Conversely, the first quarter tends to be a seasonal low for us in terms of net cash flow given the payment of the dividend in January and other cash uses that occur only in the first quarter.", "Finally, in closing, I would like to offer some comments regarding our underlying assumptions and 2009 sales outlook for certain key markets.", "With respect to reconstructive joint replacement, we assume that we will continue to see some level of elective procedure deferral that will modestly impact the overall industry growth rate by an estimated 1% to 2% points, suggesting market growth in the mid-single-digit range on a worldwide constant-currency-dollar basis in 2009.", "Our trauma and CMF franchises are largely immune to any economic slowdown given the predominantly non-elective nature of these businesses so we continue to assume market growth in the high-single-digit range. ", "Given spines exposure to elective procedure slowdown we assume the market slows to the high-single digits, versus the low-double-digit rates it has been sustaining.", "Turning to our MedSurg franchises, these markets are more challenging and given that approximately 60% of total MedSurg sales are classified as capital purchases. We expect to see low- to mid-single-digit year-over-year declines in this business on a quarterly basis for the remainder of 2009 owing primarily to continued weakness in medical.", "To further help you with your modeling, we believe our medical business is stabilizing from a dollar perspective but would remind you that growth rates will remain under pressure and we would emphasize the exceedingly challenging year-over-year comparisons for this franchise in Q3.", "Also by way of reminder, our instruments business is facing a very challenging comparison in the second quarter given the 22% constant currency growth recorded in the previous year and as such we would expect the year-over-year growth rates to slow from Q1 levels.", "For 2009 outlook we are making revisions based on the above assumptions. As most of you are aware, we tend to challenge our organizations in our top and bottom line growth targets aggressively, which has historically served both the company and our shareholders well. ", "However, the significant economic slowdown, particularly its impact on our MedSurg franchise, was greater than expected in Q1 and prompted us to take a more conservative stance as it relates to the remainder of 2009. As we finalized our budgets in late Q4 the markets were in considerably greater flux and our insights into our hospital customers\u2019 spending plans were more limited.", "Four months later there are still uncertainties, particularly as it relates to both elective procedures and the markets outside the U.S. with the latter having remained fairly insulated from the economic slowdown.", "But despite these uncertainties, based on trends in recent weeks, and incoming order patterns, we feel comfortable with our ability to achieve our revised sales target of 2% to 5% operational growth for 2009, which assumes low-single-digit constant-currency growth in the first half of the year with a modest acceleration to mid-single-digit range in the second half.", "With respect to earnings, although recent trends indicate that our capital-based businesses are bottoming, we are taking a more cautious stance with respect to our guidance with our full year EPS target at the midpoint of a $2.90 to $3.10 range, up 2% to 10%.", "We reiterate that given year-over-year comparison, compliance spending, FX, and our assumptions regarding our top line, we continue to expect earnings to be stronger in the second half of the year, which currently does not appear to be fully reflected in the first call estimates.", "With that, I will turn the call back over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Before we open up the call to Q&A I would like to make just a few brief closing comments.", "As our revised guidance reflects, we are considerably more cautious regarding the outlook for the remainder of 2009 versus our expectation at the start of the year, given lingering uncertainties relating to elective procedures and hospital capital budgets that at this point have been well vetted.", "Although we have seen evidence that the downturn in hospital capital purchases is bottoming and we have adjusted for the impact on elective procedures, we are opting to set the low end of our sales and earnings range at a level that we believe reflects any reasonable downside risk to the assumptions in our outlook that Curt discussed in detail. ", "And quite frankly, given our own disappointment that we failed to accurately forecast our sales and earnings outlook to investors at the start of the year, we believe it is critical that we set expectations at a level that removes as much doubt as possible regarding our ability to deliver.", "It\u2019s worth underscoring that our conviction and our ability to deliver low-single to low-double-digit earnings growth, even in the fact of a difficult economic backdrop, in large part reflects the impact from the myriad actions we proactively initiated in the fourth quarter to leverage our cost structure. The moves were company-wide and have unlocked meaningful earnings power despite a challenging to line and underscore the importance of these actions.", "Beyond allowing for solid earnings growth in 2009, our efforts on the cost front should position us well to drive greater P&L leverage as we exit the current recession.", "Finally, our results once again speak to the unique competitive advantage of our diversified revenue base and underscore the significant opportunities we have to drive continued growth across numerous geographies.", "There is another point I would like to make here. It is clear we are facing some short-term challenges but we would be remiss is we did not remind you that we remain very excited about our longer-term growth prospects. With the investments we\u2019ve made in previous years to build a  more diverse orthopaedic implant franchise, as well as our initial expansion of our MedSurg businesses outside the U.S., we continue to see great growth opportunities for all of our franchises in the years ahead and our balance sheet remains a source of strength, which should also serve us well going forward.", "We look forward to providing you all with a more detailed update regarding our key franchises and new product launches at our upcoming analysts meeting which will be held May 20 in New York City.", "Lastly, the conference call for our second quarter 2009 operating results will be held on July 21, 2009. And with that, we will now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "The first question I have has to do with the guidance, on the top line. Because if you look at the midpoint of your guidance, would suggest that basically for the rest of this year you expect your results to be somewhat in line with the growth that you put up in the first quarter. In other words, you expect things will basically stay the same for the rest of the year relative to that 3.3% growth that you had in the first quarter. But then you also went on to say that you think hips and knees and may decelerate a little bit and spine may be a little bit tougher and you hope that the MedSurg stuff holds in. ", "So I\u2019m just wondering if you can kind of reconcile those two things and talk a little bit more specifically about the encouraging signs that you mentioned within the MedSurg business.", "Katherine Owen", "I just want to jump in with one point of clarification. In our comments regarding elective procedures and our assumptions regarding spine and trauma were really intended to give a little bit more color to what was baked into our assumptions than we have historically done and really aimed at helping people understand how the year is going to progress. ", "We have seen a lot of that in the first quarter. We\u2019ve talked throughout the first quarter about some of the impact on elective procedures, both for hips and knees, as well as on our spine business. But I would not view that as something that is changing meaningfully, from the first quarter into the rest of the year, that\u2019s somehow going to result in a meaningful deterioration in those businesses as the rest of the year unfolds.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "But still the basic premise here is that things are going to stay the same with what you saw in the first quarter and I\u2019m just wondering if we can put a little more color around that, especially as it relates to specifically what you\u2019re seeing with MedSurg.", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think from an overall implant standpoint, I think we feel pretty good about being able to deliver consistent results with what we had in the first quarter. As you look to the balance of the year on the MedSurg side, instruments will probably slow a bit, I think particularly as Curt referenced, the second quarter is a really funny comparable, but hopefully endo and medical, over the course of the year, should certainly not slow any worse. And if anything, by the time we start coming to the fourth quarter those comparables get better.", "Bob Hopkins - Banc of America Securities", "As a follow-up then, just to clarify, could you talk\u2014you mentioned some encouraging signs within MedSurg. Could you just talk a bit more specifically about what you\u2019re seeing. Is this anecdotal evidence of people saying they\u2019re going to place orders or are these actual orders happening? Just a little more color around that would be really helpful.", "Stephen MacMillan", "It\u2019s anecdotal in both fronts. I would say it\u2019s certainly some of it feeling, some of our team feeling that they\u2019re a little closer to getting some orders. I would also tell you that I think our sales force is learning that they\u2019ve got to go deeper in figuring out to penetrate the accounts to shake some of the capital free. ", "But I think we also again, we\u2019re trying to be cautious here and while we\u2019re saying we\u2019re some pockets, we are not declaring the bottom. And I think that\u2019s why we want to still be cautious there.", "Curt Hartman", "I think one additional comment there is, as we have indicated over the first quarter, we do have a pretty high degree of contact with the large, integrated delivery networks across the U.S. market and we\u2019ve tried to put labels on their spending patterns, be they frozen, be they, on the other extreme, very fluid. ", "And I would tell you over the last six to seven weeks we\u2019ve not seen a meaningful in those rates, and by that I mean they have not continued to be a higher number of accounts freezing capital spending. We have actually seen them moderate and stay stable, which we think indicates, bodes well, versus the dramatic swings we saw in the first six weeks of the quarter.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, it\u2019s stopped getting worse. It hasn\u2019t yet turned up but we\u2019re viewing that as hopefully some pockets of hitting bottom. But again, I think we all, in this environment, and particularly given our over-aggressive approach coming into the year, we certainly don\u2019t want to declare we\u2019re at the bottom yet.", "Katherine Owen", "Just one additional follow-up because it\u2019s probably a point that\u2019s worth covering in some detail, and you probably are well aware of this fact, but it is important to recognize when we talk about capital purchases, hospitals do not view all capital equally. ", "There is a very big difference between capital purchases they need to facilitate procedures, which is a lot of what we offer, versus some of the really big-ticket items. So some of the trends that we are seeing right now are prospective incoming order patterns and some of the feedback we\u2019re getting from our sales force, may be different for different companies that offer higher-ticket items.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rick Wise - Leerink Swann.", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "You talked about the one adjacent market for the bed business, track of opportunity, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re looking around for others. Are there some significant other opportunities you might want to highlight, that you are thinking about, that we could hear more about as the year unfolds?", "Katherine Owen", "I think we are probably going to defer that a little bit until we go to May. We thought at the May 20 analyst meeting we are going to dive into a lot of that across our franchises. We thought it was worth mentioning the medical one for two reasons: one they did just launch the Impression offering and it\u2019s a fairly meaningful market that we\u2019re not really in right now so we thought it was worth highlighting. And as you know, we tend to talk about products after they\u2019re launched.", "And secondly, it\u2019s one of our businesses that has been under the most pressure. It is the most exposed to capital so it\u2019s a way to explain where some of our conviction comes from that they business is stabilizing. We thought it was worth pointing out that there are folks expanding into new markets.", "But we will address you area of question more fully at the analyst meeting.", "Rick Wise - Leerink Swann", "The spine market, you highlighted as going high-single digits instead of low-double digits. Could you give us a little more color on your perspective? Is this people deferring procedures in your view, just what\u2019s going on? ", "And last, maybe you could give us an update on the FDA inspection issues. You had said in the fourth quarter we have two times as many FDA inspections going on as compared to the prior year, i.e. suggesting progress. Again, any comments there would be helpful.", "Katherine Owen", "Let me tackle the second part of your question first as it relates to the FDA inspection. At this point not a whole lot of color to add. We have obviously remained extremely focused on addressing the issues raised in the warning letters to lead to a successful re-inspection while also continuing to make the investment in our compliance initiative across the company because we are going to continue to have FDA inspections.", "Beyond that there is not a whole lot of new updates from our last call. But as those updates become more meaningful we will certainly circle back in with everybody.", "As it relates to spine, I think it is exactly what you said, it is similar to hips and knees in that we are seeing deferrals. A little tough to know how long they will be and it\u2019s certainly not something we\u2019re seeing across the board, but rather pockets where some physicians are seeing some slowdown.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Let me start with a couple of areas that were obviously notable in the quarter. You talked about the medical business, and that business certainly, within the company, is feeling the biggest impact from what\u2019s happening at the hospital level.", "You said you thought the sales levels had stabilized, which is maybe good and bad, because the first quarter is usually your lightest quarter of the year. How do you get visibility around that? How do you get visibility around the idea that sales maybe stabilizing at their current level and how far out can you see?", "Curt Hartman", "I think what we would look at in our medical business at the dollar reported level in the U.S. market, our comment there is we believe it\u2019s stabilized or effectively we don\u2019t expect it to go any lower. ", "Our visibility is that typically in the medical franchise, those orders are well in advance and they are scheduled shipments because if you think of the size of the bed frames that are coming in, these come in in large trucks. It\u2019s a very much scheduled-in-advance event. You may have patients on beds that have to be moved onto new frames, so these things are pretty far out into the future and as we look at our incoming, or expected, order flow, we still see news of favorable outcomes in the future. ", "We don\u2019t\u2014I refer back to the summary of customer calls that we make\u2014we don\u2019t see things continuing to degrade out into the future.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Let me touch on another item. You had a real slowdown in the fourth quarter and first quarter, and that was your knee business, where you\u2019ve had sustained double-digit growth in your core knee franchise for several years now but it seems the economy is starting to have an impact on the knee market, and that\u2019s what the other players have reported thus far.", "Can you talk a little about knee volumes and the backlog at your customer base, what you\u2019re hearing from the neurosurgeon, maybe just compare it to what we\u2019ve heard about backlogs coming in and what visibility you might have on that portion of the market which seems most successful to the economy, that portion bottoming over some point in the balance of the year.", "Stephen MacMillan", "The knee market right now, it was a little surprise to us. It did feel like the market itself was certainly a little bit slower here in the first quarter, and particularly in the United States but a little bit outside.", "We are hearing just a range of stories right now. From some of the docs at some of the leading big institutions, not affected at all, and then other both geographic or institutional folks who have gone from six-to-eight-week waiting lists down to very little waiting lists. And it just really seems very pocketed and no clear trend other than there are certainly some people pulling back.", "And I think, again, that\u2019s part of the reason for our conservatism here as we go. The simple thing would be to say, hey, we\u2019re going to bounce back into the double-digit knee growth range that we\u2019ve had certainly over a number of years, but I think, again, we\u2019re just a little more cautious and you know, hearing some of those pockets, it looks like you\u2019re probably picking up as well.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Steve, with what\u2019s happened to your markets over the course of the last six months and the changes in your business plan for 2009, are you doing anything with your compensation structure for sales reps to help people through this tough period and improve retention, not that retention has ever been an issue for Stryker. But are you doing anything with your comp structure that we should we be aware of?", "And on the tax issue that you raised today, the press release, can you give us any sense of range of potential impact there?", "Stephen MacMillan", "On the comp structure piece we are paying very close attention to it. We have not modified or making significant modifications at this point in time, partially because we want to see how things continue to play out. But obviously our sales people are very important to us and we do pay close attention to that.", "Curt Hartman", "On the tax issue that was raised in the press release, as we indicated, we are not going to go into great detail there. What I will tell you is that this a multi-year process. The company is constantly being evaluated for its tax positions. That\u2019s just part of the normal process. We are in receipt of a letter that is very specific in nature of what they\u2019re looking at in terms of cost-sharing arrangements with various of our foreign manufacturing entities and we feel these positions are very well justified and we will defend them vigorously and as such we expect this process to play out over many years. We\u2019re not going to get into any amounts here. Suffice it to say we feel good in the position we established long ago on these cost-sharing arrangements.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Do you know of any other companies that received a similar letter and will you be releasing a copy of the letter in the 8-K.", "Curt Hartman", "We are aware of other companies that have received this letter, some in med tech, some outside of med tech.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "Looking a little bit longer term here, you have hospitals that are delaying purchases. Do you have a feel for how long they can delay these products? Is this more when the money is available they will purchase it? How do we think about return to growth?", "Katherine Owen", "It\u2019s really a very big range, not only for our businesses but for all companies offering hospital capital purchases. If you look at certain products like power tools for example, those are key in facilitating surgeries that are necessary for hospitals to make money. They do have a very specific life cycle and they do need to be upgraded. Other products like beds and structures where you have seen greater impact, those can be delayed for a longer period of time.", "So it really is all over the map. What we have tried to do, accept the expectations based on what we have been able to glean from recent weeks on order trends across all of these businesses, appropriately risk assess it, which is really what\u2019s at the bottom end of the range as opposed to what we\u2019re expecting to put out this year, and recognizing there is going to be variability between endo, medical, and instruments given that they vary with respective to capital exposure.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "In your guidance, what are you assuming for a share count?", "Katherine Owen", "For the full year 2009?", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "That would be helpful, yes.", "Katherine Owen", "Give us one sec.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital", "And while you\u2019re looking for that, you spoke about cost controls. Could you give us an idea, or flush out, what kind of cost controls you\u2019ve been able to put in place?", "Stephen MacMillan", "It started with headcount control. We typically dramatically expand our sales forces at the start of every year and do a lot of hiring very early in the year. One of the things of certainly sensed was it might be a little more difficult so it started with headcount control.", "And we\u2019re doing all the usual, you know, certainly at this point looking at our travel budgets and a lot of the standard stuff. Longer term there are also a lot of opportunities, frankly, on the supply side, the manufacturing side, the sourcing side, that we are also getting into, that frankly we think we think will yield more benefits probably in 2010 and beyond.", "So we\u2019ve got short-term stuff but also we\u2019re using this as an opportunity to look deeper at our cost structure to wrestle out more costs in the 2010 and beyond period as well.", "Curt Hartman", "On the share count assumption you should use approximately 399.0 million shares.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "First question, on beds. Business came off here in the U.S. more than we were expecting and it sounds like more than you were expecting. OUS was kind in line but just looking at the second quarter comps it looks like you\u2019re heading into some tougher comps beginning in the second quarter.", "And then also I was wondering how confident you are that you won\u2019t see the same kind of freeze-up on the international markets, say, later in the year that you have seen here in the first quarter.", "Stephen MacMillan", "The second and third quarter, we are clearly going into two additional tough comp quarters on the medical business, in the U.S. and even a little bit internationally. And that\u2019s going to make it a challenge.", "Having said that, again, I think we feel that we\u2019re probably at an absolute level, an absolute run rate that we probably won\u2019t go much below based on what the order trends have been for say four months or so running.", "As we think about the international piece, the growth rate looked pretty nice in the quarter but we remind you, our international business is tiny and so we think even is the capital starts to freeze up a little bit more internationally we still have so much opportunity and runway because we\u2019re just getting started there.", "Katherine Owen", "Just one quick follow-up. I would also just call you back to the comments we made in the beginning about some of our new product launches, like Impression that\u2019s going into a $400.0 million market that we\u2019re not really in. So our ability to expand that footprint is part of what also helps going forward.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Yes, I got that. What sort of share do you think you could conceivable get in that market over time?", "Katherine Owen", "Well, we\u2019re starting close to zero, so higher than that. I don\u2019t want to throw out share numbers, it\u2019s really just intended to help you guys understand that strategy of continuing to expand medical\u2019s footprint.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "In beds, I\u2019m just trying to understand is that a market that is sort of split like two or two-and-a-half ways like some of the other bed markets you\u2019re in or is there a different dynamic there?", "Katherine Owen", "Are you talking about the number of competitors?", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Yes, or in other words, like if we think about that $400.0 million add, is that something that you have one large competitor, two larges competitors that are in it and then now is your chance to play, or is it a more complicated adjacent market?", "Katherine Owen", "It\u2019s fairly concentrated with just two, three key players and then there\u2019s some much smaller players on the periphery. And again, we\u2019ll go through a lot of this in a lot more detail at the analyst meeting next month.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "And one follow-up here on spine. I think you mentioned that the comps were getting a little tougher, maybe some increase in deferrals there. But I know there were tough comps last year, too, and it just seemed like the drop was pretty significant and primarily in the U.S. Like 6 points or 7 points constant currency, sort of sequential drop, is more significant than we\u2019ve seen in that business probably for the last two years or so.", "Is there anything else going on there competitively? Is there anything else going on in terms of your distribution or geographically that has impacted that business.", "Stephen MacMillan", "First off, the base obviously is getting harder and harder as we go into\u2014I think we\u2019ve had 8 straight years right now of 20% growth so we probably are starting to bump against that. I would also tell you, there\u2019s a couple of little self-inflicted things. We made a couple of changes in sales force stuff and a couple of key geographies that we think will strengthen us for the future that probably set us back a touch in the quarter. And that business is still of a size one or two of those can actually affect a couple of points of growth. ", "So I think over time that team has shown us they know what they\u2019re doing and they\u2019ll be back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "I have a quick question on the clarification. When you talked about the hips and knee markets earlier on, how has that changed from what you were saying at the beginning of the year? Has it gotten a lot worse or has that been about the same. I feel like some of your commentary throughout the prepared remarks was a little bit all over the place.", "Katherine Owen", "I would say the 6% operational growth on hips and knees in the quarter, I would just back to our comments that it\u2019s been a relatively modest impact and we still expect the market to grow 1 to 2 points shy of that 7% to 9% secular growth rate. So I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a dramatic impact.

", "But clearly, with us looking for the market to grow mid-single digits and with similar growth rate that we put up in the quarter I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a major impact.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "And the price cuts in Japan, so what happens as we move into April. Are there new price cuts or we\u2019ve fully anniversaried them so we should see pricing and rationaling improve a little bit.", "Curt Hartman", "I think the price cuts in Japan as it relates to hip and knees are two year movements, so these cuts were put in place of April 2008, we would not expect anything additional on the hip and knee side until sometime in 2010. ", "However, in the calendar year 2009 there are other categories that have been looked at and price cuts proposed. They are on smaller franchises like CMF and in our trauma business and we\u2019re not ready to talk about what those numbers may be at this point in time but we are expecting some price cuts in 2009.", "It is possible then again in 2010 that they could revisit the hip and knee market and look at additional price cuts there but again, it would be very early for us to speculate on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I wonder if I could ask a little bit on some of the expense lines, particularly gross margin and then some of the other operating expenses. You mentioned that on the gross margin line you are seeing some compliance costs run through there as well as some just slowing in the manufacturing volumes. Now are these trends I imagine we should see continue for the rest of the year so we really shouldn\u2019t expect much expansion in that margin?", "Curt Hartman", "I think those are fair comments and I just point to the first quarter of 2008, there really was not a sizeable number from a compliance standpoint running through there. That\u2019s fully anniversaried and we are running at a full pace across our manufacturing with the compliance spend.", "In addition, as you look at the external market and the revenue growth for guiding, you should expect that we will continue to slow some of the manufacturing sites most impacted by the economy and I think what we would guide you to is a gross margin in line somewhere between we recorded in the first quarter and perhaps 20 basis point or 30 basis point lower over the course of the year.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "So actually ticking down over the course of the year.", "Curt Hartman", "Potentially, and again, guessing a little bit here on what happens with procedure volumes, as we don\u2019t 100% have clarity, as well as guessing a little bit on what goes on with the capital outlook through the second half of the year. While we feel optimistic giving some anecdotal information we just frankly won\u2019t know until we get there. And as I stated in my inventory comments, we are very focused on driving and managing inventory levels so there is a second impact on gross margins from that.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And on the other expenses, SG&A and R&D, obviously R&D was quite low this quarter and you mentioned the timing of some expenses. I mean, on a dollar basis should we look for that to start ramping again as you move through the year or is your sort of cost containment mind set going to kick in here and kind of keep the number relatively low?", "Curt Hartman", "I think our comments on R&D\u2014and I need to give you a little bit of perhaps a longer-term perspective. As you recall, back in the mid-2000s we ramped R&D up substantially and some of this downward trend in R&D as a percentage of sales is a reflection of some of that spending migrating over the generally 2- to 4-year life cycles of product development within our company.", "As we look at the remainder of 2009 we do expect R&D as a percentage of sales to move forward, on an absolute dollar basis. It will be within the range of what you saw in the first quarter, perhaps a little bit higher.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And on the last line on SG&A, is that the line we should really expect to see the cost containment kind of play through and expect that number to maintain relatively where it is or should we see it expand as we typically do over the course of the year?", "Curt Hartman", "We\u2019re very focused on SG&A right now and have been, really going back to the early part of the fourth quarter and the organization is rallying this as an area of savings to leverage our future earnings. So I think the number that we\u2019re showing for the first quarter is a relatively safe assumption that we\u2019re going to try to maintain that or lower levels.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "On an absolute dollar basis?", "Curt Hartman", "On an absolute dollar basis I think you should see it perhaps moving lower.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I think you said we should expect the tax rate to be the same as it was in 2008, was that correct for the full year?", "Curt Hartman", "Substantially in line with the reported full-year 2008 tax rate, yes.", "Raj Denhoy - Thomas Weisel Partners", "So slightly higher than we saw here in the first quarter?", "Curt Hartman", "Yes, it may move back and forth a little bit. It\u2019s a little bit hard to predict, especially as business volumes have changed, the manufacturing source of those items is going to move our tax rate around a little bit up or down. So right now our best estimate is that it will be in line with the 2008 rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell - UBS Securities.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Securities", "Steve, I have a question for you. You know, most of the things we\u2019re talking about today are transitory in nature. Capex should come back. Surgical volume should come back, certainly. The question I have, and this is something that longer-term investors are fearful of, is that there has been a period in the past\u2014\u201892 to \u201899\u2014when commercial insurance payments to cost ratios depressed and that had an adverse impact on the price environment, a significant adverse effect on the industry.", "Is there anything that you see, either in the healthcare reform packages that are circulating through Congress, or just the economic pressures on employers that could result in that payment to cost ratio going from around 1.3 back down to the historical nadir of 1.15 or so?", "Stephen MacMillan", "You know, there\u2019s nothing specifically that we\u2019ve seen to that effect. Having said that, I think we\u2019re continuing to assume that certainly the days of the early 2000s of very positive pricing are long gone and we\u2019ve got to figure out to make money in a basically a flat pricing environment to even, you know, as it\u2019s been the last few year, trickling recon modestly down.", "Having said that, we also continue to look at every market we\u2019re in and from a patient standpoint knowing there are opportunities for more and more surgeries. You know, if you still look at it there are a lot of people that still are great candidates for joint replacement that don\u2019t have them. The younger population is going to continue to demand and want products. And ultimately I think will be willing to pay up if there\u2019s more co-pays and things like that.", "So I think we certainly see some payor pressure but we also continue to feel that one of the pieces that I think is getting missed in all the current pressures are, you know, people are going to need their joints replaced and need spine surgery and everything else is still going to be there for us. And we think the companies that are there are still going to do very well.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Securities", "So to put a finer point on that, that period\u2014\u201892 to \u201899\u2014looked like it was ASPs net of price and mix were minus 5% per year. Do you see that as likely?", "And my second question is really pertaining to\u2014I noticed in I think it was a Wall Street Journal report, they said that the FDA has been encourage to revisit class III devices that have been 510-k\u2019d and that there will be a grace period in which perhaps PMA-like data sets will be submitted to retain the label on those devices. Is that likely and would that complicate your life immensely if in fact a corporate warning letter issues?", "Stephen MacMillan", "First, I\u2019ll answer three questions even though you should have only asked two.", "We don\u2019t see it going that negative, back to your comment about the 5% of the \u201892 to \u201899 period. ", "The specific class II piece, obviously\u2014as it turns out, our particular businesses are relatively unaffected by that label [inaudible] FDA will overall be working on and looking at probably more data rather than less data over time.", "On the third part, just as it relates to a corporate warning letter, we remind you, we continue to invest a lot in\u2014you know, we have a lot work to do. I think that\u2019s become more painfully clear to everybody. I\u2019m very proud of a lot of the work we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve still got work to do. We\u2019ve been investing very heavily, as you see in the margin side, but each month that goes by, it\u2019s a month we\u2019re closer to the other end, and yet again there\u2019s probably still many, many months before we\u2019re completely where we want to be, but each month goes by feeling better.", "Curt Hartman", "I have one additional comment here in terms of long-term EPS guidance, both for pharmaceutical and med tech companies, and that\u2019s the debate that\u2019s going on right now relative to corporate tax rate on foreign earnings and depending on where that shakes out and what potential number shakes out, you could see the industry, med tech and pharmaceuticals, with much different earnings outlook.", "Bruce Nudell - UBS Securities", "And how vulnerable is Stryker on the [inaudible] of companies?", "Curt Hartman", "It all comes down to what that rate, if that law advance and what that rate winds up being. So it would be premature to speculate because it all based on how that law, if there is a law, is set up, what rate it is, and what kind of reciprocal tax rate alignments are with the international markets that companies like Stryker have foreign operations in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "Looking at the mix dynamic, given the relative lack of kind of cost benefit analysis and higher mix products, at least from randomized trials, is there more exposure there longer term as we see pressure on reimbursement structurally?", "Katherine Owen", "I think that one is a little bit tough to answer. I think we are clearly seeing an FDA that is looking for more data and some the commentary that\u2019s come out of some of the proposals from the administration about wanting to see more clinical data. How it plays out with different price products, we\u2019re really in a period of absence of any real details to put some parameters around that.", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair", "As you think about the MedSurg or the capital equipment portion of that, has the softness you\u2019ve seen, can you characterize as a mix of either orders not coming in our actual deferrals of existing orders or outright cancellations? And what sort of policies do you have on that sort of behavior pattern because that seems to me\u2014I guess the main question is, is it a mix of those things?", "Curt Hartman", "I think the principal outcome right now in slower or lower MedSurg revenue is the deferral of orders. We\u2019re not seeing big trends in cancellation of existing orders or complete elimination of orders and I do think deferrals are the biggest majority.", "And on that, as we look across the segment, we don\u2019t see any share losses, either. So it\u2019s just an overall deferral or delay in the order trends, which I would assign to the majority of the revenue decrease.", "Katherine Owen", "The only additional comment I would add on to that, if you think about the products that we have within MedSurg, whether they be power tools or the endoscopy products like the video cameras, those are all necessary to performing surgery so in essence they have to be deferrals, you cannot just stop making those purchases. It\u2019s not like there\u2019s an option to you if you don\u2019t have a power tool to develop on doing a hip or a knee replacement, or at least not an option you would really want to consider.", "And on the bed side, even though there is probably a greater ability to defer some of the medical products, as capital budgets start to come back and hospitals resume building, those purchases will have to be made just simply to meet the volume demand.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "When you look at your sort of general recon forecast for Stryker what are assuming in shares? Should we assume it\u2019s flat or up for 2009?", "Katherine Owen", "I think you could probably assume the share trends are relatively consistent with what you\u2019ve seen. If ever there was a period where we\u2019ve gone through potential upheaval, it\u2019s over the last 18 months with the monitors even then, you saw shares relatively stable. We have tended to do better on knees and not as well on hips. Probably more of a migration to the mean between the two of them. But in general you really have never seen a dynamic play out in the recon market where you\u2019ve seen dramatic change in the share shift and we would expect that trend to continue.", "Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "One follow-up on the recon market, internationally, other than Japan where you\u2019re seeing the impact of price, are there any other decent-sized markets that are seeing an economic impact or is it pretty consistently stable across the board?", "Katherine Owen", "It\u2019s relatively stable outside the U.S. Remember, as it relates to the orthopaedic business a lot more of that comes under nationalized health care so you don\u2019t see the same out-of-pocket pressure that some of the individuals in the U.S. have seen. When we talk about elective procedure deferrals that\u2019s much more of a U.S.-based comment. And again, on a selective basis because it\u2019s not a wide-spread trend we\u2019re seeing uniformly across all of our accounts.", "On the MedSurg business probably partly because our shares are so low and we are in the very early stages of that expansion, we haven\u2019t seen the same impact. Certainly can\u2019t rule that out. Quite frankly, it\u2019s part of what\u2019s dialed in to the low end of our forecast as we talked about trying to address any reasonable downside risks, one of those would be much greater pressure on the OUS businesses.", "Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "So when you give the 1% to 2% decline in volumes, you\u2019re really only seeing that in the U.S. at this point.", "Katherine Owen", "On the reconstructive?", "Matthew Dodds - Citigroup", "Recon only, right.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, that was much more of a U.S.-based comment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company.", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "I just wanted to follow-up on the pockets of weakness in the U.S. We heard about that, at the orthopaedic surgeons meeting in February. Are there more pockets now and have the pockets of weakness, have they gotten weaker since then?", "Katherine Owen", "I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s any real change from the comments that we made back at the academy where we talked about seeing some pockets of elective procedure. It\u2019s very much the same trend that we were noticing back earlier in the quarter. It hasn\u2019t worsened, it hasn\u2019t gotten better.", "Ed Shenkan - Needham & Company", "And on the international side for capital equipment, I just wanted to follow up on the earlier questions that people had. Has that slowed off as much as the U.S. already? Have you seen the impact as profoundly already on the international side?", "Katherine Owen", "I think what we were pointing to is certainly you see it in the number given medical and end over growing in the mid-teens outside the U.S. but we\u2019re down domestically. Our international MedSurg businesses have fared much better and as we commented early, part of that is the nature of that market. It isn\u2019t seeing the same capital pressure, but part of it\u2019s also we have much smaller bases in those markets so we are in much more of a growth mode.

By my math a share repurchase would be pretty accretive. Just wondering what your plans are there and then I guess the second part of that question would be how much of your cash is overseas and would there be tax issues with repatriating some of this and is that why you\u2019re not going to necessarily use that cash for buy backs?", "Katherine Owen", "There really hasn\u2019t been any change for our overall strategy as it relates to cash. We view it as multi-pronged meaning that whether that is looking at M&A opportunities, potential for share buy-backs, which we did last year, as well as the dividend which we have continued to increase in recent years. ", "M&A remains our preferred use of cash. Clearly in this environment we\u2019ve had an opportunity to revisit certain areas, given where evaluations are. But I would also remind you I wouldn\u2019t interpret the lack of seeing deals close as a lack of activity. We have very high hurdle bars that relates to due diligence and also where we think about valuation, we think that has served us well in the past as we look at different opportunities and we will continue to do.", "Share buy-backs remain a potential use of cash. We do not currently have one in place. That could change going forward but nothing to announce at this time.", "Curt Hartman", "And I would reinforce Katherine\u2019s earlier comment that acquisitions are definitely the preferred use of our cash at this point in time.", "And your second question relative to our cash position, U.S. versus OUS, we historically have not broken that out but it\u2019s safe to assume that over time we\u2019ve built a large cash position outside the U.S. and certainly any time you repatriate those funds you are going to pay a tax penalty over the rates that are applied in those respective international markets.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia Capital Markets", "I know that you don\u2019t want to say a lot about the tax issues and the letter that you received from the IRS but you did note it in the press release and I guess if you have gotten these in the past you haven\u2019t, as far as I\u2019m aware, notified us about them. So you say that\u2019s it\u2019s material; what is your threshold for what you would consider to be material.", "Curt Hartman", "I would answer that question two ways. It\u2019s noted in the press release because it\u2019s a very specific letter related to a very specific issue called cost-sharing arrangements. And cost-sharing arrangements, if you were to dive inside the IRS, they note it as a tier-1 agency issue and by that the IRS defines a tier-1 agency issue as an issue that they intend to investigate across various industry segments, if not the industry in its entirety. And as such they have taken a very aggressive position and from an internal standpoint we felt it was best to disclose it.", "I\u2019m not going to get into the level that we define as material relative to Stryker overall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "OUS knees were a bit light of our forecast while OUS hips were a bit better than I expected, reversing trends from at least the last few quarters, if not years. Can you provide some color on the reversal? Is this largely a function of comps, reverse into the mean, change in strategy or something else, and is this dynamic expected to continue over the next few quarters.", "Curt Hartman", "I do think on international hips we are thrilled with the 9% operational growth in the first quarter. I would tell you if you delve back into the first quarter of 2008 you would see that the comparable was relatively soft. We are encouraged, however, about our European hip results and there has been some additional focus in that market on the recon product offering.", "Over on knees, internationally the comparable from the first quarter of 2008 was in the mid-single digits so year-over-year the 4% is not going up against what I would call an arguable tough comp.", "And overall I don\u2019t have any good rational reason why the number dropped to the 4% range that we reported. Outside of the selling day impact that we experienced in the first quarter and a few what I would call minimal issues related to product supply as we continue to work through our remediation efforts on various aspects of the knee systems.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "And my follow-up is a bit of a high-level question. I think back in January you indicated that you expected double-digit sales growth and at least 15% EPS growth in 2010 and beyond. Independent of what you described regarding an uncertain outlook for the tax treatments, is there any reason to believe that there\u2019s been change in your thinking on longer-term goals?", "Stephen MacMillan", "No. You know, clearly the short-term environment is worse than what we anticipated but I think it gets back to we continue to feel great. Now think about it this way. Each franchise we\u2019re in, we can look at every single one of them and say, you know what? We can grow each of these businesses a lot, both in the U.S. and internationally. And there\u2019s not one business we\u2019re in right now that I would say we would get out of.", "What\u2019s really interesting if you actually dig a little deeper and look into some of the numbers, almost everyone of our franchises had double-digit local-currency growth in either the U.S. or international in the quarter. Hips and knees were the only two that didn\u2019t.", "So I think we continue to feel very good about the longer term and we are in a little bit more short-term challenging but still feel good about the ability to be a top line, double-digit-growth company and solid EPS growth north of that as we go forward.", "Katherine Owen", "The one follow-on comment I would make is there have been some positives that have come out of what has clearly been a challenging, not just for us but the markets overall. It has prompted us, as we talked about, to really take a very hard look at a lot of our spending. Some of that is short-term in nature to deal with the environment, but as Steve alluded to earlier, a lot of that is taking a look at some of the inefficiencies that have come out our decentralized structure. Certainly don\u2019t want to lose the decentralization. It\u2019s a big part of what drives this organization but when you look at our vendors, our suppliers, the benefits that come out of the investments and the remediation, there\u2019s going to be some longer-term leverage driven out of this P&L that doesn\u2019t go away simply because the market environment starts to get better.", "Stephen MacMillan", "If you look over the 8 years or so, we feel like we\u2019ve built a great footprint. That footprint has been working beautifully for us. Right now in the very short term it\u2019s probably working a little bit against us but as soon as the fundamentals, you know, we get through this short-term period, we continue to feel that the long-term fundamentals of the footprint that we have plus the cash position we have, the culture we have, are going to continue to distinguish us as market share gainers and growing faster than most of our competition.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "I wanted to go back to the guidance, but kind of the recalibration from 6 to 9 to 2 to 5, is that just solely due to MedSurg expectations or you also recalibrating a little bit what to expect in orthopaedics?", "Katherine Owen", "We really tried to walk through a lot of the assumptions back in Curt\u2019s earlier comments. I will just reiterate them briefly. We talked about expecting to see the pressure on the elective procedure markets as it relates primarily to hips and knees and spine, trimming a couple of points off the overall market growth for those businesses. That\u2019s what we saw in the first quarter and that\u2019s what we are assuming continues to play out throughout 2009.", "The bigger changes relative to our prior thinking really goes back to our MedSurg businesses. We talked about, to give you specifics that help in modeling, Curt referenced that we expect medical to be relatively stable on a dollar basis, on a quarterly basis, going forward, based on incoming order trends, based on some of the intelligence we\u2019ve been able to gather from our sales force as well as from some our customers that we track on a weekly basis.", "Recognizing tough third quarter comps for that business and tougher comps for the instruments business in the second quarter. So the bigger change relates to those two franchises within that search. And with some residual, or more modest impact on the ortho businesses.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "Okay, because I thought last time there was some haircut in the numbers already for ortho so it sound like maybe a little bit more this time around.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. We changed the range down so I think that\u2019s a fair statement.", "Kristen Stewart - Credit Suisse", "And then just thinking about the orthopaedics, you were saying that there was an extra selling day this quarter but last quarter a year ago you had obviously talked about Easter having a negative impact. So is it kind of net-net, kind of equivalent effective selling days?", "And I know in the hip business you had the recall a year ago as well, so have you looked at what the growth rates may be kind of excluding that Easter effect and excluding the hip recall a year ago.", "Curt Hartman", "We have looked at all of that and a little bit more. If you looked at the first quarter of 2008 there is actually a day in there for Leap Year and you lose a day because of Easter. If you look at the first quarter of 2009 and you look at the Stryker vacation calendar, we use a day for New Year. So when I normalize everything and look at the average day sales rate and I reconstructed implants, it\u2019s a little higher than our reported rates because of those various day changes year-over-year.", "So I really didn\u2019t want to get into all that detail because it sounds like excuses and I would rather just report a really good strong recon number.", "And we did talk that the Trident, really the impact of that recall was felt in the March through June timeframe, when you look at supply disruptions and refielding of that product.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Glenn Navarro - RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn Navarro - RBC Capital Markets", "I have a question on marketing spend behind knees and hips. Your top competitor, Zimmer, is out talking about spending more to educate physicians and then hopefully rebuild market share.

Is there some wiggle room in the Stryker numbers that will allow you to spend more in the back-end of the year if you need to preserve market share?", "Curt Hartman", "I think on the spending categories, we have not historically delved into the various divisions respective marketing plans. I think on those two categories you identified, our orthopaedics division both in the U.S. and internationally, under the plans that were outlined and approved through the federal monitor, have weighed out training programs as it relates to hips and knees. This would also apply to our spine and other orthopaedic implant franchises. And there has been no reduction in those plans.", "The targeted spending that we are looking at really relates to items that are on the periphery that as an organization that\u2019s decentralized like Stryker has grown, have crept up into other areas of the business. And those are the ones we are really focused on. ", "And so I don\u2019t think you should assume that things that are germane to growing the business are first on the radar screen to be cut and remove from our plans. I think you should assume that those things on the edges are the things we are going after aggressively and working to remove out of the plan. ", "And as it relates to the second half of the year, if we thought that there was a great marketing plan that would drive our revenue in any of our product segments, we would probably by targeting that, especially considering the external forces at work in the market.

Obviously as we build an annualized capital plan some of those expenses are targeted our geared toward what I would refer to as plants, capacity expansions, or operational efficiency improvements, and to the extent that any of these plants have seen meaningful slowdowns we\u2019re probably going to hold back on those spending. ", "Conversely there may be other categories that are targeted at a special market that we now have an opportunity to go after. So I think the range is still appropriate, if not perhaps a little bit lower.", "Greg Halter - Great Lakes Review", "Can I presume the Impression product is somewhere in a facility where you don\u2019t need to spend?", "Stephen MacMillan", "It\u2019s pretty minimal.", "Curt Hartman", "I think you can assume that\u2019s pretty well taken care of at this point.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Just as a quick reminder to everybody, May 20th will be our analysts meeting so we\u2019ll give a little more light into a lot of what\u2019s going on at that point in time.

My name is Regina, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session (Operator instructions)", "Certain statements made in today's conference may constitute forward-looking statements.

Please proceed.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you, Regina, and good afternoon everyone and welcome to Stryker\u2019s fourth quarter 2009 earnings report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "With 2009 results now complete, and as we focus on our commitments for 2010 we thought it would be helpful to put some of the key events over the past 12 months into perspective. Clearly, 2009 presented us with considerable challenges ranging from impact tied to the global economic upheaval to concerns over US healthcare reform. And for us, we also continue to invest in our quality and compliance initiative where we are now well into year two of our three-year initial program.", "Against this complex backdrop, we were able to maintain our history of delivering year over year sales growth, albeit well below historical levels. Amidst the challenges, however, we were actually fairly pleased that four of our five implant franchises, including knees, trauma, spine and CMF achieved double-digit growth in the important US market for the full year, and hips continued their improvement but 6% for your US growth. Although, MedSurg 2009 sales were down 7% in the US owing to the drop off in hospital capital purchases, we benefited from our broad geographic footprint and continued focus on expanding these franchises outside the US, were sales achieved a 3% constant currency gain in 2009.", "A focus on strict cost controls and leveraging our infrastructure allowed us to achieve adjusted EPS growth of 4% in 2009 and 11% for the fourth quarter, consistent with the commitments we made back in April. And we were also able to successfully deploy a portion of our sizable cash balance in a series of acquisitions, most notably, the late 2009 purchase of Ascent Healthcare, which we view as an important strategic move to help us better partner with hospitals to help them achieve their cost savings and sustainability goals.", "So, in a year where we had to play some needed defense we were also laying the foundation for very accelerating growth in the quarters ahead. Also as part of our capital allocation strategy, we put in place a $750 million share buyback program in late 2009. Although M&A remains our preferred use of cash, the share buyback gives us additional flexibility.", "As we sit here today, we believe we've emerged from what has undoubtedly been one of the most challenging years in our company's history. Although many of the headwinds that were presented to us in 2009 will linger a bit in 2010, we do expect to show improving momentum as evidenced by a return to more reasonable top and bottom line growth. To put it another way, our 2010 guidance does not yet reflect what we believe will be our longer-term sustainable sales and earnings growth rates. But we are clearly entering this year with improving momentum.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Steve. As we done on prior calls, I would like to provide an update and some additional perspective on several key topics, including hospital capital budgets, pricing and OP-1. With respect to hospital capital budgets, the environment remains challenging however, we continue to believe that we are in a period of greater stability based on feedback from our hospital customers. Although we don't expect 2010 to go back to business as usual regarding new hospital capital projects or capital spending in general, we believe the environment will show signs of incremental improvement. Recall that close to 60% of our MedSurg sales are tied to capital purchases and we would expect that business to show continued stability with some incremental improvement in 2010. And note that with roughly 40% of MedSurg sales coming from disposables, there is an offset to the hospital capital pressure which will help the total franchise in 2010. Curt will go into more detail regarding some of the key assumptions that will help with your modeling.", "Turning to pricing, we continue to experience low single digit price declines in our domestic hip and keen business, which was not significantly different from prior quarters. Our other implant businesses had varying pricing trends with trauma and CMF continuing to realize price gains while our spinal implants experienced ongoing pricing pressure.", "On a geographic basis, pricing was flat outside the US, given price declines in Japan which was offset by more favorable pricing dynamics in other regions. Also our global total company price was down close to 1% in the fourth quarter.", "Finally, I will make some comments regarding the status of OP-1. As many of you are aware, we have been evaluating various strategic options falling be disappointing FDA panel review in late March of 2009. This process has taken longer than we initially anticipated given the myriad consideration including our existing customer base in the US and Europe, our manufacturing facility in New Hampshire, and the early clinical data we have accumulated which demonstrates potential promising efficacy of OP-1 in the sizable soft tissue market. All of these factors and others are being actively reviewed and analyzed in order to make the appropriate next step.", "Our ultimate goal is to ensure we are maximizing the potential for future applications of OP-1, while balancing that against the need to ensure acceptable returns on our investments in biotech.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. I will open by saying we are generally pleased with our fourth quarter results. They were in line with our expectations and coupled with our third quarter have us leaving 2009 in far better shape than it began. Overall, we feel the operating businesses are on solid footing and importantly we took some key steps to strengthen the business. To that end in the quarter, we were pleased to close on a couple strategic acquisitions with the most notable being the Ascent Healthcare business. Finally, the quarter was very busy in terms of completing a number of changes in our capital structure to include the previously announced dividend policy change, approval of the $750 million share repurchase authorization and the election to repatriate from foreign earnings $787 million of cash. We view these actions is providing us with enhanced financial flexibility to pursue our strategic objectives.", "Moving to a more in-depth look at our business results, I will begin with a review of the impact that foreign currency had on our sales. In the fourth quarter, currency contributed to an increase in top line sales by approximately $73 million and improved the company's overall sales growth by 4.3%. This was just over the top end of our expected range of 3.2% to 4.2% in the quarter. Overall, in 2009 currency variations cut sales by $110 million, which reduced reported growth by 1.6%.", "Looking to the first quarter of 2010, currency should remain a positive and if rates hold near current levels, we would expect first-quarter sales to be favorably impacted by approximately 4% to 5% when compared to 2009. Using current rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales will be an increase in a range of 1.5% to 2.5% when compared to 2009.", "Next, I would spend a moment on the impact of price and volume mix on the top line. In the quarter, companywide selling prices decline just shy of 1% on a worldwide basis. International pricing was flat, while domestic pricing declined by 1%. Domestically, hip and knee pricing was once again down in a low single-digits, while spine experienced another quarter of increased pricing pressure similar to the levels in Q3. Consistent with previous quarters, trauma and CMF implants had favorable pricing that largely offset this pressure.", "For the year, the pricing was effectively flat with marginal gains in international pricing offset by less than 1% decline in domestic pricing. For the quarter and year, volume and mix was generally as expected for orthopedic implant products, while volumes were off across the MedSurg categories. In the quarter, there was one extra selling day in most markets compared with the prior year.", "Moving to the franchise segments, I will restart with orthopedic implants, which represented 61% of our sales in the quarter. Orthopedic implants reported a 10% increase on a reported basis, which translated to a 5% gain in constant currency. Our hip franchise was up 10% as reported in dollars and increased 4% in constant currency in the quarter on a worldwide basis. Consistent with previous quarters, Accolade, X3 and Trident products paced our growth.", "In the US, hip sales were up 7% continuing to favorable trends from the second and third quarters. We continue to feel that our momentum in this market is improving; Trident, Accolade and X3 all delivered solid gains. Internationally, hip sales were flat on a constant currency basis in the quarter. Also gains in Pacific region and Japan were offset by declines in other international markets. Europe was essentially flat in the quarter and top brands again included Trident and X3.", "Our global knee franchise record 11% sales growth in dollars and 7% increase on a constant currency basis during the quarter. The US knee business had another solid quarter reporting growth of 10% against the stiff prior year gain of 16%. Growth was driven by the continued strength of the Triathlon line, strong primary growth being supported by continued acceptance of the Revision line. Internationally, knees were down 1% on a constant currency basis. Gaines in our Japan and Canadian business were offset by declines in other international markets. Europe knee results are stable and consistent with the third quarter. Triathlon system continues to gain broad acceptance in the international markets. Overall, the reconstructive implant market in Europe remains challenging, which we believe is principally a macro trend given economic pressures that are likely dampening procedure volume in countries with nationalized healthcare. The trend is not new and is likely cyclical as the inevitable back load of patients requiring hip or knee surgery will need to be addressed, although the exact timing is difficult to predict and will likely vary by geography.", "The global trauma business recorded a 13% increase in dollars and 6% increase in constant currency in the quarter. Our US trauma franchise recorded 11% growth against an 18% prior year gain and essentially finished the year at growth rates consistent with the first half. Sales of foot and ankle, hip fracture and lower extremity products paced our trauma growth. International trauma sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter, with sizable gains recorded in the Pacific region offset by softer performance in other international markets. On the product line basis, International trauma sales were paced by growth in hip fracture and extremity products.", "Our global spine business delivered 9% growth in dollars and a 6% increase on a constant currency basis. US spine sales slowed to 4% growth in the quarter, which is clearly below our historical average in this market, an increasingly price sensitive market some internal product introduction delays and some gaps in our offering have us forecasting slower performance over the next couple of quarters for our US spine business. We are clearly uncomfortable with this pace, and we note that our team continues to work diligently to address our current shortcomings and we would expect this to translate into stronger top line results as we move towards the second half of 2010. Our spine results were buoyed, however, by strong international spine sales that delivered operational growth of 14%, representing our third consecutive quarter of double-digit international spine market growth. Interbody and thoracolumbar devices again [ph] paced our gains.", "Next, I will turn to the MedSurg group, which represented 39% of our sales in the quarter. As a reminder, MedSurg is comprised of three segments that historically generate approximately 60% of sales from capital equipment. In the fourth quarter, consistent with previous quarters this year, slower capital equipment sales impacted the MedSurg business results. In total, MedSurg sales increased 2% as reported and were off just under 1% on a constant currency basis, representing an improvement from the 7% constant currency decline in Q3.", "Sales for the global instruments business, which historically generate 40% of sales from capital equipment, grew 4% in the quarter and 1% in constant currency. In the US market, the instrument segment took a small step backwards from a growth standpoint, reporting a decline of 1% against the prior year comparable of 18%. Sales of single-use consumables as well as increased sales in the products to serve markets outside of orthopedics helped to offset lower capital equipment shipments. Internationally, instrument sales again posted also gains, regarding an increase of 6% in constant currency with nice gains in the European and Pacific markets.", "Our endoscopy segment delivered a nice finish to a challenging year. Fourth quarter reported sales increased 7% and advanced 3% on a constant currency basis, and we would note that Q4 represented the fourth quarter in a row of a sequential increase in dollars since. As a reminder, approximately 60% of sales are from capital equipment in this business. Our US endoscopy sales moved into positive territory in the quarter by posting 2% growth. The consumable portion of our mainline endoscopy business again delivered solid growth and the supported by a modest uptick in the video segment in the quarter. Internationally, endoscopy sales remained positive recording a 6% constant currency gain growth spread across all international markets.", "Finally our medical products, which generate approximately 90% of sales from capital equipment saw global sales decline 8% in the quarter as reported and 10% in constant currency. On an absolute dollar basis, medical has now posted three quarters of sequential increases in quarterly sales. US medical sales delivered sequentially better results in dollars, but still declined 11% versus last year, while our international market sales were down 6% in constant currency.", "That wraps up the business segment. So I'll now turn to the remainder of the income statement beginning with our gross margin performance. Fourth quarter gross margin increased 10 basis points compared to 2008 and increased 30 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. Margins the quarter continued to be impacted by a favorable mix of product sales and pressured by continued investments in our compliance initiatives. For the year, we lost 80 basis points of the gross margin line versus prior year as favorable mix of product sales was more than offset by a continued quality investment in higher inventory charges. Research and development spending represented 4.9% of the sales in the quarter. While this represented the lowest percentage of sales for the year, it did represent the highest absolute dollar investment in R&D in 2009. And for the year, R&D represented 5% of sales.", "Turning to our selling, general and administrative costs; fourth quarter spending increased 7%, but was flat as a percentage of sales compared with prior year levels. This excludes the impact of the patent litigation settlement, which was recorded in G&A. For the year, SG&A declined by 90 basis points as a percentage of sales versus 2008 levels. I would reiterate that we remain comfortable with fluctuations in these categories for selective investments. Once again, excluding the impact of the patent litigation favorability in the 2008 restructuring charges, our fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 11% and the operating margin increased hundred basis points versus prior year to 24.6%. For the year, on an adjusted basis our operating margin improved 70 basis points to 23.8%.", "Other income of $9 million in the quarter was made up of $15 million of investment income offset by interest expense of $6 million, and the company's effective income tax rate excluding the impact of the repatriation of the patent litigation was 28.3% in the fourth quarter of 2009. Our full year 2009 tax rate excluding repatriation and restructuring charges was 27.5%, roughly flat with 2008 levels.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter and the year with $2.95 billion of cash and marketable securities, up $750 million from the $2.2 billion at year-end 2008. Further in the quarter we took several actions to enhance our capital structure to include the repatriation, dividend policy change, and share repurchase authorization.", "It\u2019s been a challenging year. I'm particularly proud of our asset management performance as delivered by our divisional business leaders and the divisional CFOs. Our year end and full year performance demonstrates sound stewardship here as evidenced by our final metrics in AR and DII [ph]. On that note, AR days ended the year at 56 which represents a decrease of three days compared to the prior year. For the quarter, AR days averaged 58. Clearly our focus here remains an imperative and it\u2019s nice to see the effort paying off. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 145, which was down 19 days sequentially and 10 days against the prior year. Although we realized solid improvement, our inventory levels and overall inventory management remain a continued area of opportunity.", "Finally, I will provide some quick commentary on cash flow. We continue to perform well with full year cash flow from operations up 24% to $1.46 billion and free cash flow up 29% to $1.33 billion. In summary, 2009 finished better than it started. We had solid results from our implant franchises, but incurred a bigger than anticipated hit to our capital equipment sales. Our actions to stem the slide were quick and while our results were not at historic levels, we do feel they represent an important step in returning to growth in 2010 and beyond.", "Turning to our outlook, the financial forecast for 2010 includes a constant currency net sales increase of 5% to 8% as a result of growth in shipments of orthopedic implants and MedSurg equipment. This range is inclusive of the impact of the Ascent acquisition, which we anticipate will add approximately 2% to our top line. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be favorably impacted by approximately 4% to 5% in the first quarter of 2010 and approximately 1.5% to 2.5% for the full year of 2010.", "Supporting this outlook I'd like to offer some comments regarding our underlying assumptions for certain key markets. With respect to reconstructive joint replacement, we assume that we will see stability in the domestic markets, which translates into mid-single-digit growth plus or minus a point or two. As mentioned earlier, the international reconstructive markets experienced some level of procedure delay and that trend is expected to continue during 2010. Against that backdrop global market growth rates could average low to mid single-digit on a constant currency basis in 2010. Globally, pricing is expected to remain under pressure similar to what we have discussed in our 2009 results, but we are not forecasting a further degradation at this time. Our trauma and CMF franchises should continue to perform in markets that appear to be moving in high single-digit ranges. Certainly any meaningful economic recovery could add to growth rates as procedures here are closely tied to large construction and driven miles. Finally, in spine we see high single-digit procedure volumes with forecast increased pricing intensity. We will continue to focus on expanding our product offering in spine and leveraging our sales footprint with plans to return to our long-term track record of gaining market share.", "Turning to our MedSurg franchises, we assume modest growth in capital spending defined as a low to mid single-digit increase. We would underscore that there will likely continue to be quarterly variability as it relates to the growth rates for all three of our MedSurg businesses given the timing of product launches and the swings in year-over-year comparables. Put another way, we would not model the recovery of our MedSurg franchise as strictly a function of the percentage of sales that are tied to hospital capital budgets. Although that's clearly a factor, it's but one of many that dictates the quarter to quarter performance for these businesses. In summary, our guidance assumes 2010 global MedSurg sales growth in the mid-single-digits on a constant currency basis.", "Turning to the P&L, we expect margin improvement at the gross margin line, offset by continued investments in our compliance initiative. R&D spending is planned to increase in 2010, both as a percentage of sales and in absolute dollars as we move closer to the midpoint of our desired 5% to 6% range. We see continued opportunities for leveraging SG&A as a percentage of sales as we look to remain disciplined with respect to discretionary spending, while making the necessary investments in our sales force. We expect tax rates will remain substantially in line with 2009 levels notwithstanding the increasing complexities for all in the global tax environment. Finally we expect diluted net earnings per share for 2010 will be in the range of $3.20 to $3.30, an increase of 8% to 12% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $2.95 in 2009. This range includes the interest expense associated with our recently completed public debt offering. On our current open repurchase authorization I would note at this time that we have not been in an open window to make any repurchases. Further you should assume that the goal of the authorization is to prevent dilution as well as position the company to opportunistically acquire shares as the market opportunities present themselves.", "With that I will turn the call back over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks, Curt. Before we open up the call to Q&A I would like to offer some closing comments. We really excited about our future, particularly as we emerge from the difficulties presented in 2009, which limited our ability to maximize our sales potential. With that said, we remain cognizant that there will likely be ongoing uncertainty and new challenges presented to us in 2010. We believe our 2010 target strike the appropriate balance between returning to our objective of delivering superior sales and earnings growth, while recognizing that we are not yet back to what we believe will be our long-term normalized growth levels. Our ongoing investments in compliance will strengthen our infrastructure, but will also serve to be an important competitive advantage longer term and allow us to operate more efficiently.", "In closing, we are committed to not only delivering on our financial targets for 2010 but also reestablishing Stryker as a company that achieves consistent and superior results for all of our customers, physicians, patients and investors.", "With that, we will now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein. And your line is open, sir.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Let me start with spine. You saw a pretty substantial slowdown there on a sequential basis especially in the US. How much of that is company specific and how much of that is market specific, and if you could just go into a little bit more detail there?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We bet it is mostly company specific.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "And can you provide any further color on how that might be?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, it really relates to the product flow at this point. I think we were a little bit lower in terms of new product launches in the second half of last year. So for us, we view it as a temporary short-term transitional period, but that business will be coming back.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, and do you see any impact of the economy on the spine market as the whole? It seems that spines have been pretty resilient to the economy up to this point, but with unemployment continuing to stay at the current levels do you foresee any sort of lagging effect of economic impact on the spine market?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We still don\u2019t see much of a slowdown there. There might be a little bit of market slowdown in our numbers, but we always assume that it is us, if we have a little bit of slowdown. And I think a lot of spine surgery, while some people call it elective, you have to remember you\u2019ve got a lot of people who are working age that want to get back to work or want to get back to action, and we think that is going to keep that market still relatively healthy. We will be a little bit slower than it has been over the last year potentially, but probably on the margin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Hi, David.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Curt, maybe just one question, following up on the third quarter, maybe you can give us an update on sort of the impact on OP-1 implants are delayed, but I am assuming that spending levels are coming down for 2010. So could you provide any sort of outlook or quantification on sort of the relative savings for OP-1 in \u201910 versus \u201909? You also talked about restructuring in the third quarter and maybe you suggest you provide us an update about what the restructuring could mean in \u201810 as it relates to the savings?", "Curt Hartman", "David, just a couple of questions embedded in that. I think the third quarter restructurings that we talked through really involved both segments of our businesses MedSurg and the implant category where we had some product obsolesce. We did had some limited restructuring that did touch our biotech division, but really those things were more cleaning up around the edges I would call them versus anything material that\u2019s going to show up in 2010. I don\u2019t think we have gotten into breaking out any of the details on year-over-year savings that we might be anticipating for biotech, and I think as Katherine tried to allude to, we are still sorting through the host of options that are presented with our biotech business at this point in time. So probably not going to get into any breakout here on potential financial gains associated with any changes in the way we are running biotech right now because that saving has fundamentally not been made.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and then Steve you talked a lot about how mix makes you comfortable, you can maybe offset some of these pricing pressures. If we look at your 510(k) approvals track record the last six years, \u201809 was sort of a trough year for Stryker since I think 2003. So do you think \u201810 or is it \u201811 where we start to see that that relative level of 510(k) begin to turn around and go in the right direction?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Dave, it is probably a little closer to \u201811. I think we will have some good things coming through in \u201910. I think part of that I would point to is things like the magnitude of some of the approvals we will have just gotten, for example the Rejuvenate Hip, that you really should revitalize one of our largest product lines. So it is not just absolute numbers, that will be the magnitude of them. So I think we feel truthfully solid about our flow but not doing back what\u2019s thinking we have got it quite as good as we like it to be. So probably be accelerating through the year.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, just one last quick question follow-up, Curt, on spine. In terms of the sequential change, can you share with us how pricing change sequentially from third to fourth quarter?", "Curt Hartman", "Pricing third quarter versus fourth quarter was substantially in line. My comments relative to increased pricing pressure in spine were really, second half was more dramatic than first half. That was moving down in that low single digit range that we talked about really I think back in the first quarter call. So third and fourth quarter were substantially in line a little bit worse than what we saw in the first half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Good afternoon everybody. MedSurg, maybe you can expand a little bit on the 2010 outlook. At first I want to make sure I understood your comments, I think you were saying sort of low to mid single digit growth if I heard you correctly. Does that include a sense, and is that where we are going to see it? Or do we layer Ascent on top of that?", "Curt Hartman", "Rick the comment on MedSurg was directly targeted at the traditional MedSurg which would be the medical instruments and endoscopy franchises. From a public reporting standpoint, the Ascent business will roll up underneath MedSurg in our first quarter results.", "Rick Wise \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. So is it reasonable to think that with the, let\u2019s call it core MedSurg and together with Ascent, we are going to see as we saw throughout 2010, sequential dollar increases in MedSurg as we go through the year? Does that sound like a plausible scenario?", "Curt Hartman", "I think our last two to three quarters which suggest that the trends in sequential dollars are moving in the right direction. I think in the outlook commentary what we were trying to imply here is that we right now given the variations in new product launches in these businesses, given the certainly depressed comparables that we're now starting to sunset over, you're going to see varying growth rates by the franchises given their mix of capital versus consumables. But all in, we see kind of this mid single digit level of growth when you put all those factors on the table.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Tao Levy with Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good afternoon. Steve, I have a quick question for you on the 2000 \u2013 in your comment you said 2010 where your outlook doesn\u2019t really reflect that what you feel is sustainable long-term revenue and EPS growth. Well, what do think Stryker\u2019s sustainable growth rates are down the road?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Tao, I think we just want to avoid that until the economy \u2013 until we\u2019ve got a much better handle on where the global economy is. So we don\u2019t want to get into a position of putting something out there and then backing off, and I think having just come through the year we have come through, we want to get our footing back and we\u2019re still really good about getting our footing back but want to be careful in terms of articulating the longer term goals at this point. But I would say we think it will be a little bit better than certainly the guidance we have put out there for this year.", "Tao Levy \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, fair enough. And thanks, Curt, for providing the guidance on MedSurg. Can you just give me the currency impact or benefit that you expect for MedSurg specifically?", "Curt Hartman", "Tao, we have not historically broken that out. We just tend to talk about currency on a total company perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi, thanks for taking our questions. So I have one question, I guess we have covered, I mean clarify your comment on MedSurg, Curt, just to make sure I understand this. Your mid single digit is excluding the impact of the Ascent, is that correct?", "Curt Hartman", "That is correct.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "So first question on trauma and then I have the follow up just on sort of regulatory environment. So trauma, we've seen some deceleration, slight sequentially but year over year it came in. I am wondering, how much of that you see is being sort of an economy driven, how much is competitive and maybe what kinds of things do you see coming to turn that around?", "Curt Hartman", "I think a lot of it is economy. I think the biggest thing we learned last year is that a fare chunk of our business goes to constructional related jobs. I hate to say that it is both construction and driving and I don\u2019t think we had ever drilled it down into our business that much to realize how much of that affected and the same in Europe. You saw countries like Spain where certainly construction starts dropped dramatically and we saw a similar drop offs in our business. So we think that when we will actually probably near of the economic recovery a little bit more in terms of the global basis.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and then a follow up on \u2013 there was a question on 5 10(k)s, I am curious how you had looked at these potential changes coming to the 510(k) process? FDA is spinning up another meeting in the next several weeks. You have, I am sure, a number of these things in a hopper. How do you think about the risk to your near-term approvals and maybe the impact to your business over the long term should they decide to make some more formal changes?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, probably like everybody else we are assuming that the requirements for some of the products will be a little more stringent. We are waiting to see where it plays out and trying to \u2013 we are obviously putting our own preparations in place, but it is little bit like health care reform. We spend a lot of time thinking about it all and until it is settled and established, there is only so much we can comment on it.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Great, thanks Matt.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with UBS.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "Thank you, Steve, do you guys \u2013 when you think of the world wide major joint market now is mid single-digit units and flat ASPs net of price of mix about how you think of the steady state business.", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think that\u2019s about it. I think we would like to continue to think that innovation will command a bit of a premium and allow some of that ASP to still ramp up, offset or more than offset the pricing declines, pricing pressures. And ultimately it is probably going to be a little bit more of a share gain than instead of just riding the market for us.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then with regards to trauma, that market has historically been marked by relatively-low unit growth, or procedure growth, but very solid ASP inflation net of price and mix and is that likely to come \u2013 that latter component of growth likely to come under pressure or how could you offset that? What's explaining the great ASP capability in the industry?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think it will come under a little more pressure. I think probably the biggest driver of the ASP growth over the last five, six years if you think about it has been the growth in the lock plating segment that really brought much more premium pricing to that marketplace and premium priced solutions. And I think that growth is probably largely embedded in the base now and the additional growth in that area probably won\u2019t be as great going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JP Morgan.", "Taylor Harris \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thanks. It's actually Taylor Harris here for Mike. On the O-US hips and knees, the recon business, can you guys talk about is it really just Europe where you're seeing the impact of delayed procedures? And is there any evidence here at the beginning of the year that budgets are loosening up or not?", "Stephen MacMillan", "It fell primarily for us to be Europe and we don\u2019t really \u2013 nothing significant in the start of the year, nor do we really want to typically comment within the quarter.", "Taylor Harris \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then switching to MedSurg, would you guys be willing to give us a general sense of, in 2009, how the business grew segmented between the capital portion and the disposables portion?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Taylor, if I am understanding your question correctly and I am not trying to be short here, but I think if you go business by business and go to the earlier comments, if instruments franchise has capital making up 40% of that business, you should assume that there is a negative growth in the capital segments in those businesses, and on the flip side the consumables which are tied more closely to first hip and knee procedures but on a broader basis perhaps other surgical specialties like NeroSpine ENT and some other less-invasive procedures, those are going to ride the trend and perhaps be slightly above procedure volume rates. And I think the same methodology would apply to our endoscopy business where the capital segments, the video cameras, the endoscopy suites that are installed and renovation and hospital construction projects, that capital component is certainly going to be under pressure given all the events of 2009. ", "On the other hand, the consumable portion which we tried to comment on here in the last couple quarters experienced nice single-digit growth probably in line or so of both procedure volumes and then the last but certainly not least would be medical which is 90% plus capital really tied and focused heavily in the renovation new construction market as well as replacement market and that experienced a greatest pressure and I think that one is part of the clearest read-through in terms of the absolute reported results versus capital sales.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Good evening, everybody, just quickly maybe on R&D. How much of a year-over-year decline in 2009 was due to biotech versus just rationalizing spending priorities?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I don\u2019t think that we have broken that out historically, David. I would point to a couple of things however that part of the year over year decline can be attributed to that we have publicly discussed which was a year ago we shut down our investment in Sightline, which you should assume was principally all R&D work, and then certainly there is some currency variation in the R&D year over year but that I wouldn\u2019t call that the material component of an absolute dollar drop. It\u2019s \u2013 the Sightline investment was principally R&D and that certainly came out of the base in 2009, very little change.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "I am sorry; you said biotech was very little.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Very little change.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So if I look at the R&D numbers this year being down 9% for the full year and CapEx being down 10%, can you just help us with how that squares with your comments about investing for the long term and what type of spending levels we're going to see in 2010?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Well, I think and try to talk about the R&D that we should expect that numbers to be more at the midpoint of our historical range of 5% to 6%. So you can probably back into that math. And on the comments relative to investing for the long term, I don\u2019t think you necessarily kind of correlate CapEx investments to the long-term investments that we try to make which have been really over the last 18 to 24 months quality-initiative driven and those are major investments for the long term. They don\u2019t necessarily require large CapEx investments in many cases it is process \u2013 simplification process standardization. Yes, there are some CapEx investments that are associated with. But they are not game changing CapEx investments. They are more focused on process and continuity of process. So I think we have made the right investments and I think that CapEx investments are really driven from the ground up by our businesses as they look at machine and equipment and larger future R&D projects that may have a component of CapEx associated with them.", "Katherine Owen", "Just one additional comment on that, if you do look at our R&D, although below normal levels of recent years in 2009, we are still well within accepted 4% to 6% targeted range and we are expected to move up this year. So I think part of the investing for longer term conviction comes from the fact we are not in some multi-year period where R&D is running at extraordinarily low rates.", "Operator", "CapEx Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Hi, good afternoon. In a difficult environment we've heard that a lot of community hospitals are trying to reduce their mix of revision work because of the less attractive economics associated with revisions. Have you seen any increase in concentration of the revision business at larger, maybe academic centers relative to what you've seen in the past few years and, if so, is that having a more meaningful negative impact on price in recent quarters?", "Katherine Owen", "Doug, we are all kind of shaking our head here. We just \u2013 if that\u2019s a trend, it just hasn\u2019t hit our radar screen.

And then maybe just jump in over to another pricing question. Have you heard any new details on the magnitude of Japan and Australia price cuts and what O-US price cuts in those geographies are factors into your guidance?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We will refer the final out of Japan, but we as a company are assuming it will be less bad than it was last time. If you recall, we got really wacked in our trauma business, which is a big chunk of our Japanese business.

Can you hear me okay?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America", "All right, Great. Just wanted to follow up on spine and make sure I heard you correctly. You were nice to give your assumptions about market rates of growth for various markets and I think for spine I heard you say high single-digit units and then some increasing price pressure. Did I hear you correctly? So you're forecasting maybe a market rate of growth of, I don't know, 5% to 7%, not to put words in your mouth?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Number one, you did hear us right, but I think the market growth rate procedure volume number that we would be working off might be a little higher range than 5% to 7%. I think it is higher than that. I think you are at low end; it\u2019s a little too low.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Banc of America", "No, I meant for total \u2013 so it's for total market growth what you were assuming?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, it is still quite a little bit higher Bob.

Maybe following in on Bob's logic. So if you think market growth for spine is high single does that suggest that the pricing dynamic you saw in the second half and what you anticipate for 2010 is more a Stryker issue and what products within your portfolio are you missing here that you think are hurting you so much?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, there is probably a little bit of pressure on the way, probably the biggest thing we are missing is the cervical plate, a great cervical plate offerings.", "", "Ben Andrew \u2013 William Blair & Company", "Okay.

In terms of your expectations about pricing and I guess I'm just broadly wondering what gives you confidence that given all the macro factors out there influencing hospitals and the like that the pricing environment isn't going to go appreciably worse over the next couple of years?", "Katherine Owen", "Maybe because of a lot of those macro factors that have been issued that we have been seeing in one form or another year in and year out, I think could some dramatic change in health care reform change that dynamic, it is possible but I think it is specially with some of the recent event that backed up some of the recent events, that backdrop's more clouded, then you layer into that our geographic footprint and then the mix of our businesses, we have seen pretty consistent relatively flattish plus or minus a point or so impact from price overall. So it is going to take a pretty sizable change in a number of businesses to dramatically change that pricing dynamic. It\u2019s how we look at it.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "So long term we should really think about \u2013 your outlook should be maybe 1% pricing overall as a way to think about the long-term trends?", "Katherine Owen", "We kind of look at it flattish and put a plus or minus one or two point parameter around that because we just don\u2019t have that level of granularity to give you such a precise target, but something flattish.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies & Co.", "Okay, fair enough.

Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "I will take the first part then Curt will follow up on your second question. I think the way you should look at it is we are well into the second year of this three-year program that we have articulated both to the listening audience as well as the FDA. We feel like we have made some very solid progress on some fronts, but we also have a lot more work to do and we really going to look at it as we have got something definitive we can report back to you whether it is resolution of the biotech as we have done previously. Those are really going to be the data points you should look for. But we are still in the midst of implementing a very comprehensive program.", "Curt Hartman", "Glen on the investments, I will go back to the higher level comments. We had originally announced this as a $200 million investment and anticipated that to be over about a three-year period in looking through our plans that investment really started to accelerate in the third quarter of \u201808 as we got into 2009 and plans further materialized across the manufacturing network, I think it was the second quarter or thirds quarter call that we said the anticipated 2009 range was in the midpoint of the $60 million to $90 million category. ", "Certainly, there are puts and takes on that number and I would tell you that in 2009 we were very comfortable with saying that it was right near the midpoint of that number and as we head into 2010, we anticipate a similar level of spending, all of that said were as good as our last inspection and something that goes wrong in anyone of these sites that requires additional investment we are committed to make in that. But right now, the plans as we\u2019ve laid them out remain with us consistent to the $200 million, remain consistent with the three-year plan and obviously it is not a perfect calendar plan, it is going to spill into 2011 giving that our spending really started here in the third quarter of 2008.", "Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay great.

First, maybe just if you think of the O-U S markets within your ortho, recon business seeing the weakness there but within MedSurg you're actually seeing better growth there, so just curious to get your thoughts in terms of why you're seeing more equipment purchases outside of the US but the procedures aren't down? And then secondly, just wanted to get you to talk a little bit more about some of your recent deals. You guys have done some acquisitions recently, Ascent being the biggest, just curious if you can just give us some feedback about how you plan to integrate those businesses and some of the opportunities in 2010? Thank you.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure. On the MedSurg piece outside the US, I think the better way to think about that is the strategic context that we articulated a few years ago that we were going to be ramping up our sales forces for MedSurg products outside the United States. So we are really coming from much more significantly lower market shares there. So even if the markets slowed down we were on the, call it, on the growth curve as we are more so outside the United States where our shares are very small. So, that\u2019s probably the answer to that. On Ascent, we really, really like this business. One of the first things we are going to do is try not to mess it up, because it has been doing really well. So it is going to be pretty much run as a standalone business consistent with our decentralized operating model but as part of the MedSurg team, and we'll connect the dots, obviously, where appropriate. But day in, day out, going to stay very much on its own.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Michael Matson \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi.

And then my second question would just be around your latest thoughts on metal on metal-on-metal hips?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure Mike, this is Curt. I will cover the IRS letter and what your are referring to there just as a reminder for everyone was an issue that we discussed in the first quarter call last year, and it has to do with cost sharing arrangements and certain high-risk subsidies \u2013 subsidiaries of Stryker, as we have said at that time, it is an ongoing issue that we were dealing with the IRS on, and we also anticipate that it would continue to take a long period of time to resolve these matters. We commented that if we had anything of substance to discuss we would do that, and at this point in time, we don\u2019t have anything to discuss. It has no impact currently on tax rates. Certainly, there is always that risk that should this issue go the wrong way from our chair that tax rates could be impacted, but at this point in time that would inappropriate to make that statement or to model that.", "Katherine Owen", "And then on metal on metal, we continue to actively evaluate all the offerings in the hip market and clearly there's a benefit to having larger head sizes. Whether or not that\u2019s always going to be best address through strictly metal on metal or other material, I think it\u2019s one of those areas of R&D that will continue to focus on. It does appear that the penetration rate for metal on metal, which has clearly been a challenge for our hip business since we are not in that piece has stabilized somewhere around a third of the market. So we'll continue to actively monitor it, not going to make any definitive statements whether or not we will ever get in or not get into that, but do recognize the importance of being able to address that larger head segment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with JMP Securities.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 JMP Securities", "Thanks, hi guys.

And then within US hips and knees, what is driving positive mix for you guys right now either products or product categories and what gives you the confidence that you will continue to be able to generate that either through runway of your current products or through new products? Thanks.", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think the 2010 MedSurg capital numbers should we see growth in those markets, I think our first assumption is going to be that it's coming from product replacement cycles because the capital that our instruments and endoscopy divisions sell is central to the procedure actually happening. So in terms of keeping that hospital moving and operating, having replacement cycles executed in 2010 would be where we first and foremost would see that capital growth coming from. I think any return of new construction or renovation is probably more variable in nature.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 JMP Securities", "And the mix?", "Curt Hartman", "Well, on the mix if you play the recon piece, Steve, it\u2019s certainly within the knee franchise over the last year with the Triathlon partial knee replacement and also the Triathlon Revision were probably the two big drivers on our knee business, which as you guys all know continues to truck along at ballpark 10% growth well into that franchise and I think what we are really excited about this year will be a couple of launches in the hip particularly the rejuvenate, basically our first entry, really big entry into the United States market as it relates to a great modular offering.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Credit Suisse.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just kind of a bigger picture, one I guess, to the extent that you do see a greater recovery within orthopedics or MedSurg, would you be more inclined to maybe accelerate some of the investment spending in R&D or sales positions in SG&A or would basically be inclined to, you know, let it flow through.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Kristen, we would probably look to some additional expansions. If you think about what we said historically, in times of really strong growth we\u2019ve often use that to more significantly accelerate hiring both our sales forces and our R&D investments. And a year like last year candidly we pulled back. As we went into the year, we realized the year was unfolding very differently than any of us were imagining and everything else, we got more restrictive. So I think there are probably some sales forces here and there we would look to boost, and maybe some other R&D projects. So we would have some flow through but probably not a 100%.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Credit Suisse", "All right. And then just in terms of the gross margin, I think when you gave guidance commentary, I guess there was a phrase about some marginal improvement but offset by continued investments in compliance initiatives. Should we just assume, then that the gross margin is going to be more down relative to this phase and what sort of level, I guess another question would be FX impacting that why would we expect to get out maybe positively back to \u2013", "Curt Hartman", "Kristen, I think the comment on gross margin was to cover two things to probably get you to a sideways movement in gross margin. We do think there were some great actions taken this year by our various manufacturing entities and really excited by the appointment of Lonny Carpenter, Head of our Global Manufacturing and Regulatory and Quality Affairs, function because I think it's just bringing a lot of the opportunity together on the table. And we think that will translate very well into the manufacturing network conversely, every dollar that we find there, there's a potential offset in our quality to investments to compliance initiatives and we are not going to back off of those under any circumstances.

The 2010 rate, I think I commented should be substantially in line with 2009, and the little \u2013 I think it was \u2013 probably if you do the backwards math a couple million dollars higher in overall tax when you backup those one-time items, and I think what I tried to imply in some of my other comments was the \u2013 the global tax environment is very dynamic right now. And I think other companies have talked in their quarterly calls about some tax controversy that they've worked through that has put more variability in their quarter over quarter tax rates. And I think that\u2019s just a reality of where the economy is and the activity levels that you are seeing from the various tax authorities and as you resolve or settle issues, you may see variability both up and down in tax rate on a quarter-over-quarter basis.", "Taylor Harris \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, so just to make sure we have the right adjusted numbers, I have something like 28.4% for 2009. Is that right and about what you are expecting for 2010?", "Curt Hartman", "You said you had 28.4% for all of \u201909?", "Taylor Harris \u2013 JPMorgan", "That\u2019s right. I just want to make sure we calculated \u2013", "Curt Hartman", "The \u201909 number was 27.5%.", "Taylor Harris \u2013 JPMorgan", "27.5%? Okay. Thanks.", "Curt Hartman", "Your 28.4% was Q4.", "Operator", "This concludes our question-and-answer session of the call. And I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. MacMillan.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Okay, great. Actually, Regina, can we go to one more question or no? Might be too late. I suspect we are too late. Okay. Well, we will \u2013 we certainly appreciate everybody's time today. Again we feel good about where we are headed. We came out of the year stronger than we entered in and as we come into the year, we will report on our first quarter 2010 operating results on April 20 of this year.

My name is Saily, and I'll be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions)", "Certain statements made in today's conference may constitute forward-looking statements.

The company\u2019s SEC filings may be accessed from the \u2018For Investors\u2019 page on the company's website at www.stryker.com.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen MacMillan, Chairman, President and CEO; please proceed.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you, Saily. Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Stryker\u2019s first quarter 2010 earnings report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "With the first quarter of 2010 now complete, there\u2019s a lot we feel good about it. Including the acceleration in our sales and income growth, the resolution of the Mahwah warning letter and the number of new product launches, yet there\u2019s clearly still work to do as our instruments, spine and some of our international businesses are not performing were we like to see them.", "At the time of our last conference call in late January, we had just completed one of the difficult years in navigating through a series of major challenges in 2009. The year presented us with significant uncertainties that tested organization, but also serve to galvanize our company around a clear goal of the emerging from this period a stronger competitor.", "In the year, where we have to play a lot of defense, we kept playing offense as well. We believe our results demonstrate the merits of the investments and actions we have taken in recent years, in compliance, in innovation, and in acquisitions. With the resolution in Q1 of the Mahwah, New Jersey warning letter, we have tangible evidence that the considerable investments we have made and will continue to make in our compliance program are on the right path.", "Our journey is not complete and we remain committed to the $200 million three year initial program we outlined to FDA as we continue to raise the compliance bar throughout our organization. The recent positive news in FDA as strengthened our result that the cultural transformation well under way throughout the company is taking hold.", "Yet we are also pleased that during this period of meaningful investments, we have been able to successfully execute on key R&D programs that have resulted in important new product launches for our Orthopaedics and MedSurg divisions. Some of which we highlighted at the recent American academy of Orthopedic Surgeons meeting held last month. There will be of redirected R&D resources to remediation efforts over the past couple of years. We have also worked hard to deliver key new product launches and continue our commitment to innovation.", "On the M&A front, we are pleased with the progress to-date of our late 2009 acquisition of Ascent, which as the market leader in the reprocessing of single use medical devices allows us to partner with our hospital customers in order to deliver tangible cost saving and enhanced environmental sustainability without sacrificing quality or innovation.", "At the end of Q1, we also closed on our previously announced acquisition of Sonopet, which augments our instruments product offering within ultrasonic aspirator, and thesis, and accessories used in neurosurgery. Against to this backdrop, we are pleased that we delivered on our commitments in the quarter with total sales increasing 12%, on a reported basis and up 9%, in constant currency.", "Excluding the impact in the year end 2009 acquisition of Ascent, sales were up 6% to 7% on a constant currency basis. Encouragingly, on a global basis with the exception of instruments every key franchise posted revenue gains in the quarter with particularly robust performances from our knees, pharma and medical franchises.", "With the improving top line and our on going focus on operation efficiencies, we achieved diluted EPS growth of 13% in the quarter to $0.80. We are pleased with the improving profitability profile, which reflects the impact of numerous initiatives put in place over the past couple of years, coupled with our gradually reaccelerating top line, although one quarter clearly does not make a year our Q1 result reinforce our conviction in our ability to realize our 2010 commitments, while continuing to make the on going investments in our complaints initiatives.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Steve. On today\u2019s call, I will provide some additional commentary as it relate to recently product launches, pricing and hospital capital spending. On the new products front, we were pleased, we have the opportunity to highlight several of our recent introduction at last month\u2019s AAOS meeting. This included the on going launch of two new hip systems including the first Mobile Bearing Hip System available in the U.S.", "Our ADM with X3 advance bearing technology. This innovative design allows us to offer the benefits of a larger head bearing system without the need for metal-on-metal articulation. We believe this offering will overtime allow us to carve out a segment of the larger head hip market, a category where we have opted to remain on the side line as we have valuated and developed an offering that may provide an improved safety profile.", "We\u2019re also rolling out our restoration modular system, which allows a great inter operative flexibility to help achieve optimal certain performance. Combined these products should help to drive continued gradual improvement in our hip franchise over the coming quarters.", "In Spine, we still have been important gap in our product portfolio with the launch of two Cervical Plating System and although the full impact from these launches won\u2019t be realized into the second half of 2010, the ability for the spine organization to further round out it\u2019s bag is an important component of the expected improvement in our spine sales at 2010.", "Looking at pricing, for the total company pricing was down roughly 1% in the quarter largely remain with the prior quarter, and its worth noting that over the roughly past five years, the total price impact for striker have been essentially flat, which we believe underscores the benefit and stability provided by our diversified sales footprint.", "We\u2019d also know that the relatively neutral impact from pricing over this period occurred despite the fact that certain franchisers and geographies were individually experiencing a much stronger and in some cases the much more severe impact from price. Reconstructive implant continues to experience pricing pressure as excepted although our ability to realize positive mix filled by the launch of innovative products, health mitigates a meaningful potion of the pricing pressure.", "Lastly with respect to hospital capital budget, we continue to project the gradual recovery of the economic environment slowly improve. Given our mix of businesses, the considerable year-over-year variability and comparisons as well as the individual challenges and opportunities that exists within any of the MedSurg divisions, the slow recovery is unlikely to be linier, but over a multi quarter period we expect our MedSurg franchisers to grow slowly improving top line growth consistent with the goals we set out for the businesses a beginning of the year.", "Curt will provide some additional commentary as it relates to the expected quarterly progression of our MedSurg businesses later in a call. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. I\u2019ll start by saying overall we\u2019re pleased with our first quarter financial and business results. In the quarter, sales increased by 12.4% on a reported basis and 8.7% on a constant currency basis, generating diluted net earnings per share of $0.80, which represents an increase of 12.7% over Q1 2009. Components of our growth included the Ascent acquisition, which we are very excited about contributing 2.3% the required growth rate in a onetime medical order added another 1% to our sales increase.", "Internationally, we did have some challenges as our business segments outside of spine and trauma remains soft. As a reminder, our international reconstructive implant business has been negatively impacted by our decisions in 2009 to obsolete certain products and stream line our distributed model. These changes were part of the restructuring charges announced in Q3\u201909. Although, these moves do create some short term headwind component by the market softness in the Euro zone, this 2010 unfolds we expect a gradual strengthening in our international reconstructed in plant performance.", "Encouragingly, our operating profit leverage in earnings performance demonstrated the sustainable impact with some of our 2009 business transformation can have overtime. Our balance sheet remaining very strong, we again delivered strong cash performance to start the year and coupled with the capital structure changes initiative in late 2009 in the very successful January $1 billion debt offerings, we clearly have financial flexibility to pursue our strategic objectives.", "I\u2019ll now move onto the impact of foreign currency had on our sales. In the first quarter, currency contributed to an increase in top line sales by approximately $58 million and improved the company\u2019s overall reported growth by 3.6%.", "Looking at the second quarter, currency should remain a positive and the price hold near current levels, we would expect second quarter sales to be favorably impacted by approximately 1% to 2% when compared to 2009. These in current rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales would be an increase in a range of 0.5% to 1.5% when compared to 2009, down from the original expectation of 1.5% to 2.5%. ", "Next, I\u2019ll spend a moment on the impact of price and volume mix on the top line. In the quarter, companywide selling prices declined roughly 1% on a worldwide basis and volume mix was generally as expected 8% to reported sales growth. The number of selling days was effectively equal to 2009 in most markets.", "Moving to the business segments, I\u2019ll start with Orthopaedic Implants, which represented 60% of our sales in the quarter. Orthopedic implants record in 11% increase on a recorded basis in a 6% gain in constant currency. On a worldwide basis, our hip segment hosted results that were very similar to the fourth quarter with growth of 9% as reported in dollars and 4% in constant currency.", "As has been mentioned, we are encouraged by the rollout of both the ADM and Rejuvenate products and looked to their impact on future quarter\u2019s results. In the U.S., hip sales were up 7% well in international markets. Hip sales were flat on a constant currency basis with gains in Japan, offset by a low single digit decline in Europe.", "Our global knee segment continued to deliver solid results posting 12% sales growth in dollars and an 8% increase on a constant currency basis. The U.S. market continues that our robust pace while Europe remain soft. As mentioned, the U.S. knee segment remain strong delivering reported growth of 12% against the prior year gain of 8% Outside the U.S., these were down 1% on a constant currency basis with solid gains reported in the Pacific region offset by decline in Europe.", "Global trauma segment recorded a 15% increase in dollars and 11% increase in constant currency. This was a nice start and really built in our fourth results. Our U.S. trauma segment recorded solid 13% growth to start the year, our international trauma sales were up 9% on a constant currency basis in the quarter with sizable gains recorded in Europe.", "Our global spine segment delivered 10% growth in dollars on an 8% growth increase on a constant currency basis. These results were slightly better than fourth quarter results and the U.S. market has begun the rollout of the cervical plating system filling a big void in our portfolio.", "With that said, U.S. spine sales remain below historical range as recording 5% growth in the quarter, consistent with our expectations at the start of the year given price pressure and some key gaps in the product portfolio, but the recent new product introductions, we do anticipate stronger top line results as we move toward the second half of 2010. We continue to enjoy strong international spine sales with constant currency growth of 16% in the quarter based by double digit gains in all international markets. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of strong international spine segment results.", "Next, I\u2019ll turn to the MedSurg group, which represented 40% of our sales in the quarter. The reporting purposes that reflect our acquisition of Ascent, MedSurg today is comprised of our instruments, endoscopy, medical and Ascent Healthcare businesses. In total, MedSurg sales increased 15% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. Acquisition added 6% to reported increase and the onetime medical conversion order contributed 3% to reported growth. From a transparent view, we would report organic MedSurg growth of 6% in the quarter.", "Sales for the global instruments segment grew 1% in the quarter as reported and were down 1% in constant currency. In the U.S. market, the instrument segment reported 1% gain against the tough prior year comparable of the 11%. Internationally, instrument sales declined 9% in constant currency.", "Overall, instrument orders growth, outpaced shipments growth were shipments constrained by execution issues. Given accelerating orders trends easier comps and better execution, we expect the instruments growth to improve from Q1 levels as 2010 unfolds.", "Our endoscopy segment reported a sales increase of 9% and advanced 6% on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. endoscopy sales stayed on the positive trends started in Q4 by recording 6% growth. First quarter up tick in video capital sales was partially offset by continued pressure on our communication system instillations. The trend we expect will remain throughout 2010. Internationally, industry sales also delivered positive results recording at 4% constant currency gain.", "Finally, our medical segments or global sales improved 30% in the quarter as reported and 26% in constant currency is a great numbers to report, but they do require some explanation. U.S. medical sales increased 34% in the quarter and were causing the enthusiasm by noting that medical was a recipient of a large one-time conversion of rental products it had at 19% to its growth rate that\u2019s with this we are still pleased with the organic 16% growth to remind you to review this performance against the prior year comparable, which was particularly favorable. Our international medical sales increased 1% in constant currency.", "Overall, I would summarize the MedSurg quarter at the macro levels as follows: Ascent is performing as planned, if not modestly ahead of our expectations. Medical had a solid start, Endoscopy is demonstrating gradual acceleration or instrument segment needs to balance execution issues against growing demand for its products.", "I\u2019ll now turn to the remainder of the income statement beginning with our gross margin performance. Gross margins remains steady with those reported in Q4 at 67.7%, while decreasing 10 basis points over 2009 first quarter levels", "Of note, reported margins were suppressed in the quarter by 30 basis points as a result of a $0.01 acquisition inventory step up charge. Overall, this is a solid starting point for 2010 and as within our expected range. Research and development spending represented 5% of sales in the quarter will increasing 12% over 2009 levels. We expect to continue ramp up our spending here as the year progresses.", "Selling, general and administrative cost increased 8% over 2009 levels while decreasing to 37.1% of sales. The sales growth is certainly helped our leverage here as we feel we are making the appropriate investments and we remained comfortable with fluctuations in these categories as priorities materialized.", "Operating income increased 18%, and the operating margin increased a robust 110 basis points versus prior year to 24.8% of sales. Other income and expense was essentially zero in the quarter as higher interest expense associated with our debt offering was offset by earnings on our invested cash in the small foreign currency transaction game. Lower investment yields continued to limit earnings on our invested cash even with higher cash balances. Finally, the company\u2019s effective income tax rate was 27.8% for the first quarter of 2010.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with $3.94 billion of cash in marketable securities. This is up $983 million from year end 2009. As a reminder in the quarter, we completed our $1 billion debt offering issuing $500 million of five year notes and $500 million of 10 year notes. The offering was completed on January 12 resulting in coupons and the five year notes at 3.0% and 4.375 on the 10 year note for an average cost of 3.69%. We are very pleased with this outcome. ", "We\u2019re up to a good start on our asset management. Account receivable days ended the quarter at 56, which represented a decrease of three days compare to the prior year. Days in inventory finished the quarter as a 151, which was up six days sequentially versus year end, but down 23 days against the prior year level.", "On cash flow we continued to perform well with cash flow from operations of $275 million in pre cash flow of $243 million. Finally, in the quarter we\u2019ve repurchased $2.1 million shares at an average price at 51.74 for total spend of our $111.1 million under our currently authorized $750 million share repurchase program.", "In summary, Q1 was a good start on many fronts that was noted we still have some select operational and market issues to resolve in the quarters ahead. We\u2019re encouraged by indications of strengthening across our business. More broadly, we feel the last three quarters have delivered study improvement.", "Turning to our outlook, our financial forecast for 2010 remains unchanged. We are maintaining our outlook calling for net sales increase of five day percent in constant currency.", "Diluted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the 320 to 330 range representing in increase of 8% to 12% over 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share. Importantly, this range includes the interest expenses associated with our public debt offering, which translates into approximately a nickel per share and also now reflects less positive impact from currency than initially expected.", "At the close of the market today, the first call consensus stand at $0.80 for the second quarter. We view this as a reasonable estimate. Supporting this outlook, our assumption to include continued stability in domestic ship in new markets, yield the mid-single-digit market growth rates, what international markets outside of Europe see volume growth mid low to mid single digits.", "European markets remain the most challenge, but we anticipate a modest improvement from Q1 levels. Additionally, we anticipate modest improvement in our performance even the ongoing expected impact from the changes we implemented in late 2009. Against that backdrop, we think global hip the new market growth rates will average low-to-mid single digits on a constant currency basis in 2010. The trauma and CMF markets remain stable and appear to be moving in high single digit ranges. Finally in spine, we see high single digit procedure volumes, but forecast continued pricing pressures.", "Turning to our MedSurg franchises, we assume modest growth in capital spending defined as a low-to-mid single digit increase. To reiterate, that they were likely expedience quarterly variability as it relates to the growth rates for all three of the traditional MedSurg businesses given the swings in year-over-year comparables.", "We would not model the recovery of our MedSurg franchises strictly a function of percentage of sales that are tied to hospital capital budgets. In summary, our guidance continues to assume 2010 global MedSurg market growth in the mid upper single digits on a constant currency basis.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks, Curt. Before we open up the call to Q-and-A I would like to offer some closing comments. Although the recent economic upheaval combined with our own compliance issues may have given the appearance to some of you that we were a company in triage. We actual kept our heads above water remain focused and throughout this period continued to make a number of important investments in our organization that are beginning to yield tangible results.", "Some of that was apparent at the recent AAOS meeting where we highlighted a number of important new product launches. Although our business remains one largely defined by the proverbial singles and doubles as it relates to new products taken in their entirety these new product introductions underscore that innovation still matters and is a key component of our strategy to deliver accelerating top line growth going forward.", "With our considerable balance sheet and access to liquidity, we are also well positioned to continue to deploy cash on the acquisition front if the appropriate strategic opportunity presents it self. Finally, in start to contrast where we were a year ago, we feel very good about our ability to deliver on the financial targets that we presented to you back in January.", "With that we\u2019ll now open it up for questions-and-answers. So, we back to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Steve just a few quick one here. First on just markets settlement on spine, you have other players in this market place that are really talking about negative true pricing dynamics. You really focus much more on filling product mix issues for the new pipeline. Can you so talk about how the industries change the last two quarters, do you still believe, this is exclusively a mix and product innovation issues for Stryker or do you think there is some evidence for pricing pressure in this spine segment?", "Stephen MacMillan", "There is certainly some growing evidence of pricing pressure they\u2019ve don\u2019t get as wrong, having said that is we never going to blame things like that on our performance we still see significant opportunities to grow our spine business and do a back to innovation and execution and feel like we are just there is a couple of quarters here were we were slow on cervical plates, they are coming out and I think we continue to be bullish on the spine market, but certainly more pricing pressured going forward and say just in \u201906 \u201907 or \u201908 timeframe.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, very helpful and then end of the question for end market dynamics did you think about our US trends how much is do you think is simply pressured international markets versus some of your recent restructuring activities and distribution disruptions, what\u2019s the work predominant driver as you see it for your recon business or US.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure I probably give you a couple of one big I answered more specifically, I think were we really get about things right now is each of our businesses that are soft we know exactly what was going on and have a very clear plan to see when accelerating. The European piece really is focused primarily on our recon business and that is where as part of our whole remediation efforts and our quality undertaking just we mentioned in the third quarter last year we took some charge we discontinued a number of say for example single market products in Europe and also change some distributors that\u2019s going robust really though the next few quarters as we flush through that. but we think frankly from just a profitability and ability to service things going forward will be much better, but there is always a couple of quarters of pain as you discontinue long standing product that we had in those markets for 20 plus years in some cases, but frankly long term you think about inventory management working capital everything else just didn\u2019t make us much sense for us. So I think we could see at very clear to restrengthening there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets.", "Thank you very much I have two questions, one of the things which you do not mention is OP-1, and I\u2019m curious what it would take for you totally pull the plug on that product?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We are continued to evaluate that and we will report at the analyst meeting next month as to kind of where we are on that.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you, my second question has to do with your European market its sounds as if you are having some sort of internal particularly Stryker associated with Europe, but could you contrast and compare that to the border and market and what stage of the recovery back in?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure again as always we are always going to be more self critical I think those of you who have gotten to know as over the years now it will be a little more self critical. There\u2019s been a number of times, I think we\u2019ve reported some weaker results and then said it to ourselves and then it turns it out to be the market. I do think the broader European market is pretty soft right now, and net of companies that might be making an acquisition might make growth look a little bit better in those numbers.", "I think the core markets are a little softer right now, having said that again, we\u2019re in the period of really probably four quarters as we anniversary through the products we discontinued in other things like that, but we\u2019ll look a little bit worse, but ultimately we know we\u2019re making a stronger for the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tao Levy, Deutsche Bank.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Two quick questions, first you\u2019d mentioned that instruments of an execution issues can you just a go into little more depth\u2026?", "Curt Hartman", "I think the execution here is if I bull it down real simply, it\u2019s getting product out the door doing into the matter that coincides with all the upper we put in on the remediation front and riding our way through those processes to satisfy our constitutes.", "Tao Levy - Deutsche Bank", "Is that something that is it going to take few quarters to work through or there\u2019s something where you identified already in Q1 and\u2026?", "Curt Hartman", "You know what I tell you, it\u2019s very similar to what we went through in orthopedics division as we\u2019ve cascaded our quality and compliance effort throughout the corporation and by the way for those who you may recall, we had fairly tough inspection early last year at the instruments division. We\u2019re doing it additional remediation work there, and putting into effectively our new corporate compliance systems. It does means in prior to getting put on chip holds and things like that and that ultimately takes as a little wide in work through. So I didn\u2019t see steady progress here through the year on instruments and probably the worst as behind us.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mike Limestone, JPMorgan.", "Mike Limestone - JPMorgan", "Even if I backed out to be $16 million or so in one-time fill from medical business (Inaudible) I know. You\u2019ve emphasized the last month or two that\u2019s (Inaudible). How do you view the mix of comp in the second, third quarter (Inaudible) equally busy?", "Curt Hartman", "Yes, there\u2019s still pretty low Mike, and I think we\u2019re cautious optimistic that our medical business is coming back. Having said, when we\u2019re down, really the first three quarters of the year were pretty ugly, so even coming back with reasonable growth right now, we\u2019re still back below 2008 levels, I think ultimately we\u2019ll start feeling really good at once we\u2019ll back above 2008 levels and that\u2019s probably not quite yet in the plan from medical this year, but I think we are seeing a nice healthy rebound.", "Mike Limestone - JPMorgan", "Just to clarify Steve, (Inaudible) if we\u2019re thinking about medical growth over the next call short term mix couple of quarters your cost still relatively easy. Should we think about double digit growth, which reasonable (Inaudible) incorporate the trauma business had a good quarter in that remarkable people with growing about in the fourth quarter, they gone diminishing pricing capabilities and diminished mix for some companies, but your business (Inaudible) maybe if you could add more to that technique?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Back on the medical piece, I think we certainly are hoping for double digit growth I think it probably be call at wide around low double digit would be I think the minimum what we build consider success. So hopefully we will be in that range and then on the trauma business, I would say I think the trauma market was probably fairly robust in the quarter, if you think about it, maybe east cost of the United States had quite a winter even I think even Dallas had a couple of big storms of by recall and certainly throughout Europe I think it was also an unusual winter, if you say also an unusual winter you look at places like the U.K. when London gets a bit of snow we certainly benefited from that.", "So I think we\u2019re pleased with our trauma business, but we probably talk a little bit up to whether just so we don\u2019t start padding ourselves in the back and by the way if you come back a year from Dallas (Inaudible) they might have been a slightly better than usual quarter. Having said that we feel pretty good about what we\u2019re doing from a pure execution in product closed standpoint and everything else.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins, Banc of America.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "As I wondering if you could talk just a little bit more about your because one of your competitors are reported a few weeks ago made a pretty definite comment that they saw a turn in certain countries within Europe. So as I wondering if you could just provide a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing there it doesn\u2019t sound like what you\u2019re willing to make that kind of a statement. So you just looking for a little bit more color on the phase of recovery in that territory from market perspective.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, Bob the one part that be careful with this you relate to Europe is how much is the big five versus how much for other markets and I will tell you we probably been a little more conservative in some of the other markets and I call at reason and things like that. So within the big markets we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a turn and certainly the U.K is suggesting that, I think both the conservative and labor or saying there going to be you know committed to a positive NHS and not cutting back on so we think the business will be there but we have seen you now a growth in waiting list and we haven\u2019t seen anything, I think yet for our business it says it turning significantly that on left here something else to add there.", "Katherine Owen", "One question, the one comment I would add to it is given number one of the first companies to report its always a little hard to gage the market and then you combine that with what we do know very definitively which is were absolutely seeing the impact from some proactive decisions that we made in late last year, so its always hard to start out how much of that is market versus how much of that is our own decisions to make as more efficient, so we\u2019re probably little more in client to attribute the weakness in our business to the stuff we know, which is the actions we took and a little hesitant to say too much about the market other than to say clearly not back to business is normal in Europe, but until everybody reports it\u2019s a little tough to know because a few points can ever meaningful impact on but the overall feel over on market looks like stealing.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "Okay and then for second question just want to ask at everyone on the stay that the global hip and knee market, you guys made a comment as to the way you are thinking about 2010 being load a mid-single digit market globally on a constant currency basis. I guess my question related to that comment, is that completely consistent with what you been thinking over the last couple of quarters for global growth and then your comments on price with mix essentially making up most of the price decline, each one make sure that these comments, telling that you are trying to set here is a very consistent one related to what you said in the last couple of quarters or just fishing to see if there any several changes in your commentary.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Completely consistent with how we have been showing about it and I think that anything were little more encouraged by hip business might go given recent launches, we\u2019re frankly still incredibly pleased with how well U.S Knee business continues to thrive with trap one, you know just we still post in double digit growth in the U.S just dealing great about that again you know that the Europe softness we know what\u2019s behind it. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Miksic, Piper Jaffray.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi, thanks for taking the question just as one on a couple of the new products and then I have want follow up, so ADM hip and on the and the vertebral augmentation product AAOS just wondering where these have launch currently if they are launched fully and maybe if you give us some color on when we, where they were we can seem start showing up in the numbers.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure, you know I think there both what we call in early roll out note, it just been presented to the sales force is I said ADM is probably amounted to ahead as you know, typically with the recon launch it takes the better part of the year before you really have widely in terms having all the sets being able to going and get gage strive with that option and couple of follow ups and on the IVAS product that is really just in the very early stages only on the hands of the few reps at this point and health included got the 5, 10-K clearance, which we have not quite at the economy that has just covenant in the early hands in rolling out. So, these are think that we see just kind a building through the year and probably want full strive frankly in 2011.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Those are I they want them in Europe just be clear?", "Curt Hartman", "The ADM has been in Europe actually quite a while, a new US launch, IVAS I am not, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve got in Europe yet.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Okay, and follow up just on, you\u2019ve looking at all this news around sort of shipping passenger logistics and so on I am thinking your business you\u2019re your performances centers, what is going on in European shipping, European transit, air traffic I think anything to do with your ability replenish the supply plant or no?", "Stephen MacMillan", "At this point no, but we would continue over few more weeks that probably some little interception to but it\u2019s actually wide would conscious we had our European recon business being over soft right now. So, we can get through the volcano period and I am lacking that. So, but I think we are okay for little while.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Michael Matson, Wells Fargo Securities.", "Michael Matson - Wells Fargo Securities", "I just want to ask about your expectations for your R&D spending as a percentage of sales it seems like its getting increasingly difficult to get products through the FDA and with the 5, 10-K reform it potentially could get harder require more deed and fourth as well data just to help market your products. So, do you think you can really sustain not at 5% over the next two year or that something that grip up overtime lot of your appears at least out side orthopedics area talked about expecting R&D that head up?", "Curt Hartman", "Mike, this is Curt the answer is no, we absolutely expected to go up and I think out January call we comment that the outlook for this year was to be moving that number more to the traditional mid point of our 5% to 6% range and I remain committed and convince that we will get there this year as we look at our quarterly projections in the future periods here, the first quarter was a 12% increase you want know that R&D projects take a little bit of time to ramp up once you give them the go ahead signal and we remain very committed to increasing our investments in R&D, for the right projects. So I do think by the end of the year we\u2019ll be in that mid point of 5% to 6% then as the FDA story somewhat unfolds we\u2019ll figure out what adjustments we need to make if any as a remainder we do have a lot products that are in the market today under what I would call very heavy 5, 10K where there has been a lot of clinical information submitted to support those things like surgical navigation systems et cetera, so we do have some experience with what I would call the deeper requirements but obviously we don\u2019t know the full extent of the change, but we\u2019re ready to make those investments to keep the innovation side of the business moving a right along. ", "Michael Matson - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay thanks and just any commentary around if you can talk about capital spending in general and maybe in the US, I am not sure if I heard you really comment on the hospital capital spending terms outside the US and in Europe?", "Curt Hartman", "I think the comment we made was hospital CapEx in the US probably low-to-mid single digits didn\u2019t make any comments relative to the OUS because it is a little bit harder to predict given the single payer systems and how they are allocating their financial priorities going into weight list reduction whether it is a kind of a consumables or whether its capital enhancements I think its probably a little in appropriate right now for us to make the call on what the OUS numbers look like outside what were seen in our own business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel, Cowen & Company", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "The Ascent revenue number for the quarter looked a little bit better than I would have expected any chance you could provide any more color on how you got the growth such robust levels whether this was better than expected and I guess finally understand what opportunity made invest for sales internationally.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure I pick that, the very first part is we got to heck of a team and a great business in Ascent and they are executing beautifully and I think we trying to stay the heck out of their way they know what they are doing have a great value proposition frankly royalty about the pricing pressures that hospitals are under so I think that\u2019s great we\u2019re accessing the international opportunities we tell you this is the area where the regulations vary hugely country-to-country. So they are probably there\u2019s a lot of news to be done in terms of penetrating the international whether we certainly see that in to longer term growth opportunities.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Then on metal on metal any science that you might already be picking up share due to move away from metal on metal with I mean your competitors how to think you really going to have to wait until ADM with X3 on that opportunity?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Hard to say we picked anything up we do feel great about the timing of the ADM launch and think that is coming right at the right time, but again back to just recumbent, it takes a little while to that business to flip but we really like the decision were in given the market dynamics and as you know we\u2019ve kind of taken some launch and set out of the large scale gaming so we found an offering that thought would really bring an improved safety profile and meaningful point of difference to the market and we\u2019re just going to process of rolling that and feel good about the chances, but again its not even going to be a big spike in the second quarter even that\u2019s going to be a very steady build initial read certainly what we hear about to feel this very positive. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Derrick Sung, Sanford C. Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein", "On the US side for it\u2019s a need and in particular for needs we\u2019ve been seeing a pretty steady reacceleration in market growth rate over the last couple of quarters and I guess what I\u2019m wondering if how close are we too where we were before you started seeing the deferred procedures have when the economy turn down. I mean or we still a far way from there we sort of 80% of where we were in the marketplace before the recession hit?", "Katherine Owen", "I guess the couple of thoughts if you look back to \u201909 I think a lot of the concerns adding into the year was that the economic note down was going to result in a big drop of in elective procedures but you look at what actually they took place over the course of \u201909 the market slowed really marginally sells.", "At the same taken as you look to 2010 we\u2019re not anticipating some big rebound which is always talked about that kind of mid single digit recon growth recognizing its not go to be linear it may bounce around the point or two in either direction in any given quarter, but I think we would be saving a level of accuracy that we just don\u2019t have because it reflects the marginal drop of to say that we\u2019re some percentage point in the recovery I think maybe there\u2019s some pent up to demand but again its probably just on the margin just as last year any negative impact was relatively modest against the overall market growth.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein", "Then the questions on the pricing pressures that you\u2019re seeing in spine and specifically I\u2019m just wondering if you compare that the pricing pressure, that you\u2019re seeing on spine with the pricing pressure that you\u2019re seeing on the ortho recon side of the business. It sounds to me like its worse in spine than it is on hip and knee side?", "Then I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the case and if you could speak to as to what fundamental and might be the difference in the market that you\u2019re seeing more competition, price competition between the manufacturers on spine side that you\u2019re not seeing on the recon side or what else fundamentally might be different between the businesses that would be different pricing pressure that you\u2019re seeing there?", "Katherine Owen", "I would just remind you a couple of things that we brought up before. We did have some key gaps in our spine product portfolio and if you asked anybody in our spine team, they would point that being the number one headwind for us, but it also does create periods of time where you\u2019re going to see greater pricing pressure as we talked about on the last quarter.", "Both of those businesses being recon and spine are seeing price pressure as we talked about and trend some more to recent quarters, but I would just remind you, if you look at the total company, pricing is down 1% and has been in that relatively flat, which we call up one or down one, the affinity for a number of years now.", "So I wouldn\u2019t read a whole lot into any modest differences that maybe taken place between one franchise as the other, those are two businesses that are seeing pricing pressure right now as expected and it\u2019s a trend that we think we\u2019ll probably continue at least in the near term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Lichtman, JMP Securities.", "Steve Lichtman - JMP Securities", "Just first question on the U.S. recon business, as your hip business ramps up with new products flow with the same ramp, obviously carrying hips and knees, should we anticipate any softening a little bit on the knee side, just given that as well into it\u2019s launch or do you still see a long run rate there from a knee side?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Steven, as you will know it\u2019s rare for the company to have both franchises going well at the same time and that\u2019s the clear mission for our knee team knowing that the momentum is about to shift within our organization towards hips and I think they actually still feel really good and obviously we have a 510(k) submission on (Inaudible) and hope to bring some news to that dealer later this year, whatever as well. So our goal is to have great growth in both, the truth will play out.", "Steve Lichtman - JMP Securities", "Just secondly on this onetime benefit on the medical business, any sense of what the impact was to the bottom line in the quarter?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We\u2019re not breaking that out Steve, but obviously there was a onetime order and just that was important to call it out, so that people don\u2019t get overly excited about the growth rates from a onetime events.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from (Inaudible), Barclays Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is actually (Inaudible) calling in for Adam. Quick question, I\u2019m looking at the U.S business here some grew 5% and you guys talked about pricing pressures, was there also a hit to a volumes in the quarter? ", "Curt Hartman", "No, any volume piece was frankly just our product bag. I don\u2019t think we saw a big\u2026", "Stephen MacMillan", "Our U.S. spine was very similar this quarter to last to quarter. ", "Unidentified Analyst", "I guess, I think you\u2019ve talked about in the recon business, you have talked about 1% of pricing pressure and then volume mix benefit, I think about 8%. We\u2019re just wondering within a positive mix to offset that pricing pressure and I guess going back to spine, they\u2019re just not much have been hearing mix benefit in the spine business? ", "Stephen MacMillan", " I think you need to go back to the comment we made was total company that hip in the total company price was minus one. Volume contributing 8% for total company, those comments were now specific to hip and knee results in the quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Then maybe just lastly, given you guys are going into the metal-on-metal hip business and just curious to hear what your feedback is from ALS given the issues? ", "Katherine Owen", "Going into the metal-on-metal markets, probably we\u2019re going into the larger head segment where we\u2019re going in with non-metal-on-metal offering. So the ADM is the not a metal-on-metal product, but it does go into the larger head space, it\u2019s more just of a clarification that we just going to have to wait and see how things play out was noise at this recent academy meeting round metal-on-metal, but quite honestly if you go back to the ALS last year, year before, year before there\u2019s noise around metal-on-metal for a number of years and whether or not that has a discernable impact on metal-on-metal trend.", "I think we just can have to wait and see how that place out in coming quarters. I think we\u2019re more excited about the fact that we have a product offering and get us into the roughly started the market, where we haven\u2019t had a presence and we think we\u2019ve got a pretty very good competitive offering there.", "Stephen MacMillan", "We certainly felt pretty good coming out of the economy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from (Inaudible), UBS.", "Unidentified Analyst", "It\u2019s (Inaudible) for Bruce Nudell. Just on the MedSurg business, I was wondering if you could comment on how the business is doing related to what you would consider to be steady state underlying demand, so excluding any deployed distraction that you maybe experiencing presently on instruments?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think the answer is the consumable portion of the business tends to track with procedure volumes and as procedure volumes incrementally move forward from perhaps really one year ago we\u2019re definitely able to key track there the capital is obviously type of the CapEx budgets of the various hospital customers or group purchasing or initiation that may influence those capital spends.", "Clearly, that is not a study state in any sense of the word yet fundamentally over the last three quarters we have seen gradual improvement in that component of the business, which I think is evident by the broader trans in the business is that have capital components medical and instruments.", "Unidentified Analyst", "The 1% growth for instruments is now where we expect to in terms of steady state we clearly see that moving north?", "Curt Hartman", "So, I understand that it was at the underlying comment as oppose to the reported (Inaudible) on that issue would you expect to see improvement and instruments and to second quarter with there be a same level impact to the second quarter as well. No I think couple of thoughts to help frame that, we did comment in the opening remarks that we do expect to see study improvement in the instruments business.", "We also comment at the first quarter last year had a 11% growth, so that the tough comparable and there is filling to working through some execution issues we do feel good moving forward that there will be study improvement I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going intend to quantify that at this point and time, but we do think that there will be incrementally better results quarter-over-quarter there as move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Katharine, Credit Suisse.", "Katharine - Credit Suisse", "First question, can you just quantify the impact of the Japan reimbursement on price cut this month on your business?", "Curt Hartman", "I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to putting dollar terms I think what we communicated when the reimbursement information was released was that we felt: Number one, reimbursement type an impact on Stryker would be file less than last round was really focused on trauma (Inaudible) Stryker has a leading market position and we feel this one would be in the mid to low single digits on the overall Stryker Japan business, but we haven\u2019t put dollars to that.", "Katharine - Credit Suisse", "When do you expect to see improvements on the gross margin line as the spending on warning letter kind a rollout?", "Curt Hartman", "I would now direct correlation of the removable warning letters with improvements at gross margin, certainly the spending record remediation has largest impact on gross margins. Some of that spending would be to the new base, some of the spending in the early answer as we go facility by facility as one-time, but the longer term impact of that quality remediation will be felt in the gross margins, but it\u2019s not an immediate light switch event and right now we\u2019re not commenting on gross margin improvement, because our sole focused right now is getting through all of the remediation issues that we\u2019ve communicated to the FDA and we\u2019re still calling for that to be sometime end of 2011. As we look at the three year window that we initially rolled out. So right now no comments on gross margin favorable improvement as it relate to quarter remediation decreases.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jeff Johnson, Robert Baird.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "A couple of things here, I know you guys want to talk about monthly trends by any means, but Curt taking your comments that kind of strengthening, I think some of your final comments you made about strengthening here exiting the quarter. It sounds like you guys feel good at least about the trajectory of the business exiting the quarter, is that a fair comment?", "Curt Hartman", "", "Jeff, I just did clarify that comment a little bit, I think I said we liked the trend over the last three quarters. So if you go back to what we would define somewhat as our low point of \u201909 kind of that in between second and third quarter. We felt that third quarter was stepped in the right direction, the fourth quarter built upon that and we think the first quarter continues to build upon that and frankly by to the averages of the numbers don\u2019t lie the quarter was a pretty good quarter as reported.", "So we\u2019re encouraged by the results building on the three quarter trends here and I think I have to go back to the third quarter of \u201908 to see numbers in this range. So yes, we feel better where we are today and we would hope to continue that performance as we go forward in 2010.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert Baird", "I think I missed (Inaudible) three quarters versus three months some of your thought there and then just a last follow up questions just in Europe on some of the distributor transitioning. Has there been any kind of inventory return going on with that, anything you can quantify that you can see falling off as of February, March something like that, any clarification you can provide there?", "Curt Hartman", "No, there is not inventory returns related to the distributor transitions that we\u2019ve made in some of the key European markets, and this is more about a transition as a way we approach the commercial market. As Steve alluded to in his comments those transitions take time at customer level and then you layer on top of that some of the product obsceneness we did both the new orthopedic plan and MedSurg categories and how they influence our international results. Those are the factors that I would point to here and nothing that you\u2019re going to see materially one quarter over the next, because of these individual events.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vivian Cervantes, Maxim Group.", "Vivian Cervantes - Maxim Group", "I appreciate your comments on innovation and your commitment to it and also your comments on keeping on eye at on how cumulative difficult FDA environment evolve. That said just wanted to get your thoughts on possibly deploying your cash position to acquire I guess companies with product that can easily sit into your portfolio as sort of offset to potential delays on the FDA fund.", "Katherine Owen", "I think as we have articulated previously our preferred use of cashes first in form of M&A that make solid strategic sense and that\u2019s going to follow one and two paths are potentially a combination of both and we have got a very diverse sales footprint and a lot of sales people out there where we can leverage that by adding products that further round out the bag and that will be one avenue we\u2019ll look to for M&A and we are also going to look for growth platform that we think make solid strategic sense and I would point to the sense that it doesn\u2019t have fairly sit into any one divisions but we think is something that make solid strategic sense from a top line perspective and from an ability to drive long term growth, and that\u2019s going to continue to be the key guiding principles around the M&A. ", "Vivian Cervantes - Maxim Group", "On your 750 million share repurchase program. Do you have a set timeframe on when that needs to get to used up?", "Curt Hartman", "The 750 million share repurchase authorization is in open authorization that we put in place and its really to be the deployed with the far support management discussion perhaps offset dilution associated with the employee compensation programs, employees stock purchase plans things of that nature perhaps the opportunistic in the market if something would have adversely impact the stock price as relates to broader economic events, but there is now set calendar and raping that up.", "Operator", "This concludes the Q-and-A portion of the call. I will now hand the presentation back over to Mr. MacMillan.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you all very much for sitting with us and again we feel pretty good about the start to the year and will be back with our analyst meeting in May and then conference call for our second quarter operating results will be held on July 20.

", "With an ongoing focus on operating expenses and solid gross margin, we realized a 15% increase in operating income, while still driving a mid teens increase in R&D spending year-over-year and a net earnings increase of 10%, putting us on solid footing to achieve our targeted per share earnings goals that we outlined back in January of $3.20 to $3.30, up 8% to 12% year-over-year, despite facing a larger foreign currency revenue headwind. And we\u2019re clearly pleased with our demonstrated ability to execute on our sales and profit outlook. ", "Perhaps more importantly, Q2 was highlighted by the resolution of the remaining two FDA warning letters which follows the previous lifting of the biotech and Mahwah warning letters. The removal of the warning letters is an important milestone that validates the multi-year efforts of countless people within our organization and reinforces our commitment to executing on our companywide initiative. It has allowed us to redirect some of our R&D resources that were focused on remediation and resolution of the warning letters, back to more traditional R&D activities. And we probably can\u2019t overstate the fact that as it does relate to our quality journey, there is still work to do and we\u2019ll continue to invest in quality on an ongoing basis. We know we have made significant improvements in our systems and our culture and we look forward to continuing to work with FDA to realize our objective of a best-in-class quality system.", "As many of you on the phone well appreciates, given the diverse nature of our 18 mid tech franchises, coupled with our broad geographic presence, in any given quarter, there are parts of our business that perform ahead of our initial expectations, while others that lag. ", "With respect to the former, we are particularly pleased with the results achieved by all four of our MedSurg franchises, led by medical, which posted an impressive 21% year-over-year US sales increase, better than expected, even adjusting for the favorable comparisons. And after working through some challenges in Q1 tied to our quality initiative, instruments posted strong quarterly growth of 12% in the United States. ", "On the flipside, our reconstructive implants business was below our expectations in the quarter, while international also struggled to a greater degree than we anticipated. And, while US implants were still in positive territory on a year-over-year growth rate, the low single digit increase was disappointing. ", "Although, we\u2019re very encouraged by the early reception to our new hip products, as those of you who have followed the orthopedic industry for sometime are well aware the full impact if new reconstructive implants takes a number of quarter to realize, given the significant training and education, coupled with rolling out of the needed instrumentation.", "Looking at our international results, as we\u2019ve discussed the decision we made to discontinue certain products and distributors in late 2009 is causing some short-term sales disruption. And it\u2019s worth underscoring that our commitment to the objectives of our overall quality and compliance initiatives, require us to proactively make decisions across all our businesses in order to achieve our goal of becoming a best-in-class organization. ", "Although, from time-to-time, this can create sales disruption, we are fundamentally strengthening our organization for the long term. At the same time, it\u2019s fair to say, that we\u2019re seeing better momentum across our MedSurg franchises, a trend we expect will continue throughout 2010, underscoring the inherent strength of our diverse product portfolio, the latter of which reinforces our conviction in our ability to deliver on both the sales and earnings goal we outlined at the start of the year. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "", "Thanks Steve. Consistent with prior quarters, I\u2019ll provide some additional commentary and perspective on several key topics, including our quality initiative, our international Q2 performance and our spinal results. ", "On the regulatory front, as was previously announced, Q2 was highlighted by the resolution of the remaining two initial four FDA warning letters. Although, there has been some investor speculation that this may result in the ability to lower the magnitude of our investment in our quality initiative, there is no change to our outlined three year and roughly $200 million quality spend which began in earnest in the second half of 2008. ", "Rather, warning letter resolution is an affirmation of the plan we outlined is moving in the right direction. As we move to the second half of 2011, we expect a downtick in the spending as one-time investments associated with the three-year plan are completed. ", "However, as we discuss, there will continue to be ongoing investments in quality on the annual basis. We have not quantified what portion of the $200 million is one time in nature, but we would expect to redirect that spending into R&D, sales force expansion or to help offset the expected increase in cost associated with healthcare reforms.", "Looking at our international Q2 performance, we noted that impact from our decision to discontinue certain products and terminate specific distributors is greater than anticipated. As move into Q4, we should be through the bulk of that drag created by these actions. More importantly, although there\u2019s been some short-term disruption in top line impacts, we believe the decisions we made back in Q3 put us in a much better position both the quality and efficiency standpoint in the long run. ", "Lastly, looking at our spinal results, we are continuing to see the multi-pronged impact from competitive in-roads, increased pricing pressure combined with reimbursement delays and the early stage of our new product rollout. Importantly, there continue to be tremendous opportunity for innovation in the spinal market given the unmet medical need for many patients with back pain and we believe we have a significant opportunity to bring differentiated products to market. ", "Admittedly, we\u2019re being negatively impacted by some competitive product offerings, which have allowed in-roads in certain accounts and shared gains with some of the more basic spinal implants. Combined with the delays in some of our new product introductions, we have seen our spinal business come under pressure. We are addressing some of the product gaps with the ongoing role out of two new cervical plates. Although, as we discussed previously, we would anticipate that our spine franchise will still be facing pressure for the remainder of 2010.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt Hartman ", "Thanks Katherine. Overall, companywide second quarter results finished inline with our expectations. Sales increased 7.6% on a reported basis and 6.9% excluding currency, generating diluted net earnings per share of $0.80, an increase of 9.6% over Q2 of 2009. On the revenue line, the Ascent acquisition contributed 2.4% to our reported growth and for the first half has contributed 2.2% to our 10% reported gain. ", "On the earnings side, a particularly strong gross margin and a sustainable impact on some of our 2009 operating expense management efforts allowed us to deliver a very strong EBIT performance. Balance sheet remains very healthy and we again demonstrated strong cash flow generation in the quarter. Finally, after completing the first half of the year, we liked the P&L trends. And, more importantly, we remain on track to achieve our full-year company objectives. ", "In reviewing our second quarter performance, as Steve noted in his opening comments, we\u2019re pleased with the MedSurg results and trends appear to be running ahead of expectations. Inversely, there was two areas that came in below the targeted levels. Specifically, reconstructive implants, and broadly speaking our Europe business. ", "And addressing these areas, our teams are focused on three key initiatives, including, one, completing the approval process of the OtisMed product offering to address the growing demand for shape matching technology in the knee market. Two, the continuation of the two new hit launches, which have not yet had a meaningful impact on sales, but require investment in time by our sales force to train and educate doctors. And, three, the impact from our decision to discontinue certain products in Europe and terminate certain distributors.", "On the OtisMed front, we have filed the 510(k) and we are working diligently with the FDA towards an approval in 2010. In the hip area, the ADM and Rejuvenate offerings will be fully rolled out as we exit 2010 and head into 2011. The early feedback here remains very positive. Lastly, in the internationally marketplace, the discontinued products and terminated distributors are having both the direct and indirect impact on our European results. ", "We have experienced some sales disruptions beyond the discontinued products from certain customers, who were unhappy with our obsolescence plan. Although, we anticipated some short-term sales challenge, we would remind you though over long-term, these actions will allow us to operate more efficiently than a higher state of overall compliance.", "Turning to some specifics in the quarter, and starting with foreign currency; in the second quarter, currency contributed to an increase in top line sales by approximately $11 million and improve the company\u2019s overall reported sales growth by seven-tenths of 1%. Through the first six months, reported sales have been increased by approximately $69 million or 2.1% from currency. ", "Looking to the third quarter, currency moves through headwind. And if rates fall near quarter-end levels, we would expect third quarter sales to be unfavorably impacted by approximately 1% to 2% when compared to 2009. Again using quarter-end rates to full-year currency impact on top line sales would be a decrease in a range of flat-to-down 1% when compared to 2009. This is clearly a big change from the original expectation of a favorable impact of 1.5% to 2.5%.", "Next, I\u2019ll spend a moment on the impact of price and volume mix from the top line. In the quarter, companywide selling prices declined 1.5% on a worldwide basis, largely consistent with the first quarter, but keeping in mind that this is the first full quarter to reflect the new Japan price cuts. Volume and mix added 6% to recorded sales growth. The number of selling days was effectively equal to 2009 in most markets.", "Reviewing the business segments, I\u2019ll start with Orthopedic Implants, which represented 59% of our sales in the quarter. Total Orthopedic Implants recorded a 2% increase on a reported basis and a 1% gain in constant currency. Hip and knee growth slowed in the quarter to the low single digit range. Although, with new product underway and the Q4 anniversary of the discontinued products, terminated distributors in Europe, we are confident in the outlook for improving performance in the coming quarters.", "At the segment level on a worldwide basis, our hips slowed in the quarter with a growth of 3% as reported in dollars and 2% in constant currency. In the US market, hip sales were up 2%. To reiterate, we are encouraged by the reception of both the ADM and Rejuvenate products. While sampling, training and conversion to these platforms unfavorably impacts near-term performance, we are confident these transitions will leverage our growth in the quarters ahead. This is consistent with our experiences in the initial stages of the highly successful Triathlon launch as well as other implant launches. In the international markets, hip sales increased 1% on a constant currency basis. ", "Our global knee segments slowed in the quarter reporting a 1% gain that was flat on a constant currency basis. US knees posted 4% reported growth, where our OUS knees were down 7% on constant currency basis. The global trauma segment recorded a 7% increase in dollars and a 7% increase in constant currency. Our US trauma segment recorded its third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth delivering a 13% reported increase, while our international trauma sales were up 3% on a constant currency basis in the quarter.", "Our global spine segment continued to face challenges in the quarter, reporting a flat performance on both the reported and constant currency basis. Our US spine sales decreased 3% as recorded versus prior year and a solid sales performance in the international spine markets delivered constant currency growth of 7% in the quarter.", "Next, I\u2019ll turn to the MedSurg group which represented 41% of our sales in the quarter. MedSurg today is comprised of our instruments, endoscopy, medical, and the Ascent Healthcare business. In total, MedSurg sales increased 16% both as reported and on constant currency basis. The Ascent acquisition added 6% to the reported increase, while the core MedSurg business segments delivered 10% reported growth in the quarter.", "Sales for the global instruments segment rebounded from the slow first quarter start growing 9% in the second quarter as reported and 8% in constant currency. In the US market, the instrument segment reported a 12% gain, paced by sales in the neuro, spine and surgical navigation markets. Internationally, instrument sales were flat in constant currency.", "Our endoscopy segment reported a sales increase of 8% and advanced 7% on a constant currency basis. In the US market, endoscopy sales continued to improve recording 9% growth. While our OR suite communication solution remains slow, nice advances in endoscopy services, general surgery and video products were recorded. Internationally, endoscopy sales also delivered positive results recording a 3% constant currency gain. ", "Finally, our medical segments, our global sales improved 20% in the quarter as reported and 19% in constant currency. US medical sales increased 22% in the quarter on a strength of increasing shipments across beds, stretchers, and our EMS offering. Our international medical sales increased 9% in constant currency. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the results and trends from our MedSurg business segments in the quarter.", "I\u2019ll now turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our gross margin performance. Gross margins were particularly strong in the quarter at 69.3%, which represented a 210 basis point increase over second quarter 2009 levels. This improvement was paced by lower costs associated with inventory charges, higher absorption and the favorable currency impact on cost from our Euro-based manufacturing network. ", "So while Euro-based sales and resulting profitability did take a hit in the quarter, the non-Euro denominated sales in currencies like the Yen, Aussie Dollar, and US Dollar, experienced higher gross margin performance from the lower cost of Euro manufacturing goods. Simply put, the multi-currency mix of our manufacturing and distribution activities prevents correlating currency moving on the top line with that of gross margin and profitability across quarters.", "Finally, while Q2 was a large uptick over Q1 levels, it is worth recalling that Q1 was negatively impacted by both the Ascent inventory step-up acquisition accounting and the low margin one-time medical conversion order. For the first half, gross margins of 68.5% are inline with expectations and we expect future quarters to remain in this range, given all the variables mentioned above.", "Research and development spending represented 5.4% of sales in the quarter, while increasing 15% over 2009 levels. For the year, R&D is now at 5.2% of sales and up 13% over 2009 levels. Our expectations remain at full-year R&D spending will finish in this range as a percentage of sales as we continue to ramp up our innovation efforts. ", "Selling, general and administrative cost increased 7% over 2009 levels, while decreased 20 basis points to 37.6% of sales versus 2009. We continue to believe our actions in 2009 are having a positive impact, while also allowing us the flexibility to make the appropriate investments. Again, we remain comfortable with fluctuations in these categories as opportunities in the related spending materialize.", "On the 7% constant currency sales growth, operating income increased 15% and the operating margin increased a robust 160 basis points versus prior year to 25.5% of sales. Other income and expense reduce pretax income by $6 million in the quarter. Components of this included investment income of $12 million, offset by interest expense of $16 million and FX transactional losses of $2 million. Lower investment yields continue to limit earnings on our invested cash even with higher cash balances. Finally, the company\u2019s effective income tax rate was 27.9% for the second quarter of 2010. ", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $4.03 billion of cash and marketable securities of $1.07 billion from yearend of 2009. As a remainder in the first quarter, we completed our $1 billion debt offering. Asset management remains an area of focus and our results remain in the tight range. ", "Accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 57, which represented a decrease of three days compared to the prior year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at a 163, which while up 12 days sequentially versus first quarter was down four days against the prior year level.", "On cash flow, we continue to perform well with cash flow from operations of $327 million and free cash flow of $290 million. On the share repurchase program, we did not execute any additional repurchase in the quarter. Year-to-date, we have purchased 2.1 million shares at an average price of $51.74, for a total spend of a $111.1 million under our currently authorized $750 million share repurchase program.", "In closing, we feel good about the outlook for our MedSurg franchises, including the recent Ascent addition to the Stryker portfolio. Additionally, we have identified the key issues to be addressed to accelerate momentum in our reconstructive and our international businesses. ", "Against this background, our financial forecast for 2010 remains unchanged. We are maintaining our outlook calling for net sales increase of five day percent in constant currency, diluted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $3.20 to $3.30, representing an increase of 8% to 12% over 2009, adjusted diluted earnings per share. At the close of the market today, First Call consensus estimates stand at $0.77 for the third quarter. We view this as a reasonable estimate.", "In summary, our Q2 results keep us firmly on track to deliver our full-year guidance, while obviously noting we have some segment and geographic market issues to resolve in the quarters ahead. Through the first half, we think our results lineup nicely with our full-year expectations. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "", "Thanks Curt. In summary, we continue to believe that our unique product footprint is an important competitive advantage and it provides us with significant opportunities for share gains, new product development, and acquisitions. Combined with our considerable cash balances, our tremendous cash flow generation, and the overall strength of our balance sheet, we are highly encouraged by our prospects to deliver continued top and bottom line growth.", "With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for Q&A. So I\u2019ll hand it back to you Emity.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Hi, can you hear me okay?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes Bob.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Great, okay. So, thanks for taking the question. First question, I\u2019d like to ask, it\u2019s just very sort of simple big picture question on hips and knees. Steve, can you talk a little bit about why you think the growth in your hip and knee business slowed sequentially from what we saw in the first quarter? And then, now that we\u2019ve seen Biomed and J&J and you guys have reported, do you think the hip and knee markets have slowed a little bit here in the second quarter? And, if so, why?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure. Bob, it\u2019s obvious that people are going to look at the headline numbers on hips and knees and may be a little more concerned. Let me tell you why we feel pretty good and why we are not as concerned. I mean, simply, the overall number, we\u2019re a little disappointed, yes. But I think here\u2019s where we are. We\u2019re in the midst of rolling out a great new \u2013 basically two new product lines in the hip franchise. And we saw this with Triathlon, it takes us three or four quarters to get going. ", "We used the analogy back in the early days of Triathlon. If you remember, starting a new product launch for us has been like getting a freight train going. It takes a little while, while we\u2019re out educating, surgeons are trying it and going through that. And once we get rolling, we get rolling. ", "And all the feedback we\u2019re hearing from the field, the confidence that we have in our team is very, very good that we think our hip franchise will be well poised. It would have been nice to taken off a few more points in the quarter, yes. But I think the market frankly, we also think was just ever so slightly slower this quarter. I think even there bring it up to a higher level. ", "We think right now hips and knees are mid single digit grower. In any given quarter, they\u2019re up or down a little bit. We still feel good about those fundamental markets and our ability to take share. We\u2019re in that transition to new products in hips. And on the knee side, frankly, I think, we\u2019ve got some pent up excitement for OtisMed and probably some guy is just waiting for that to come on to the market hopefully later this year and they\u2019re spending some extra time on hips. So if we didn\u2019t have those product launches coming in hips and OtisMed sitting out there in knees, would we be a lot more concerned? Yes. But knowing what we\u2019ve got going, I\u2019m just thoroughly convinced our teams are taking the right efforts. ", "The other piece I\u2019ll tell you just to give a little more perspective on the whole international piece. We\u2019ve discontinued some products that certainly hurt us on the reported sales growth line. They are going to dramatically help us going forward here on the gross margin line and there are tradeoffs there that as we get rid of some of these products that we\u2019ve been serving individual markets and have been consuming a lot of inventory, a lot of plant time, a lot of resources, getting rid of those has little pain in terms of your reported sales growth. ", "But we feel very confident that this is going to payoff down the road for us and you start to see it, you know, that\u2019s not the whole liftoff obviously in gross margin, but it\u2019s a contributing factor. So I think we feel better than the numbers for this particular quarter suggest and still feel very good about the longer-term trends.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Did the Japanese price cuts take a little off in terms of the overall \u2013 your overall growth rates for this quarter, might that have accounted for a point of it? Or \u2013 and I guess, what I\u2019m getting at is, if the market softens just a little bit, you know what was the source, was it weaker pricing, was your Europe a little weaker, again not Stryker-specific question, but just from a market perspective I\u2019m curious, where you might have seen a little bit of incremental weakness. And do you think you\u2019re losing a little bit of share?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We don\u2019t think. Based on a at least J&J\u2019s numbers this morning, I don\u2019t think we think we\u2019re losing share, certainly not in the US. We\u2019re probably losing a little share in Europe, while we go through the digestion. ", "As we\u2019ve Curt acknowledged and Katherine acknowledged, we lost some customers as a result of discontinuing some of the products. We think we might have lost a little bit on knee share in Japan in the quarter that we think we\u2019ll get right back overtime here. But, overall, I think we\u2019re feeling all right. Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I would just add, we\u2019re not seeing anything different on the pricing trends in terms of the pricing pressure that existed in the recon market. I\u2019ll just say, if the recon market overall is mid single digit grower, which we think it is, I think you have to view that as a plus two, minus two bracket in any given quarter, because these numbers are never perfectly near. ", "So growing low single digits in the market we think is mid single digits, not where we want to be, but not so much of an outlier that we sit and question, is there something fundamentally different with the market this quarter and we\u2019ll have to see how the subsequent quarters shape up, but going back to the product launches that Steve spoke to. ", "We feel pretty good about our ability to gain market share, recognizing there\u2019s nothing that points to a market growth that\u2019s going to be significantly different overall on a multi-quarter basis in that mid single digit range.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you. Steve, you're probably going to get beat up over the course of this call about the performance in the hip and knee business and overall ortho. So I know you're not necessarily surprised by that. But the two key performance in US hips and knees was I think your \u2013 probably your lightest performance in a long, long time. ", "And I just want to understand, particularly on the knee side of the business, the drop-off momentum. I know there was no difference in selling days, it sounds like pricing was relatively the same versus what you saw in the first quarter, the last couple quarters. Is there anything else you could point to as to why you would have lost that much momentum this quarter versus the last several quarters?", "", "Stephen MacMillan", "", "Sure, I think Mike, as you well know, first off, I think we\u2019ve proven ourselves over the last five years that we\u2019ve been growing our knee business well above the market and certainly been hopefully a share taker in that business. I do think what we had going on in this quarter is with OtisMed, if the approval process, so that\u2019s going kind of out there a little bit. ", "And for the first time in, call it five years, our sales force actually has some hip products in the bag that they\u2019re excited about, it was probably focused on selling hips than necessarily knees. And, you know, we\u2019ll get that right back. So I think as we\u2019ve been doing the extra education on the hip line, probably we might have taken our eye ever so slightly off the ball in knees. I think we\u2019d also like to see where the rest of the competitors report. ", "We think anecdotally in the US, the both hips and knees, the market may have been a little bit softer this quarter. And again don\u2019t think people should overreact and see the market is slowing down. But, I think, you know, we\u2019re always quick to beat ourselves up on what we can be doing better and trust me we\u2019ve always get that list. I think when the dust settles, we\u2019re not going to be that far out of where even the market settled out for the big companies.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "Just with your own internal \u2013 disregard the market growth rate, so internally are you going to be surprised that, if you do believe there might have been some distractions this quarter, if you don't see a bounce back in the third quarter?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We would hope to bounce back somewhat, but I\u2019d probably temper the expectations a little bit. I think the next big catalyst in knees for us is OtisMed. We\u2019re probably the only company out there without a shape fitting option on the market right now. And we think those are important, we actually think we\u2019ve also got a real game changer in OtisMed, we need to get that through the FDA. Once that gets through, I would expect you will see a very quick re-ramp to our knee business.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Good afternoon.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Hi David.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "I just maybe switchover from recon for a second here and focus maybe Curt on gross margins. I know you try to provide some visibility, but obviously a much stronger trend we expected and you\u2019re saying it\u2019s sustainable above a level we would have expected. Can you help us understand given sort of to some negative mix in recon more specifically maybe in terms of basis points, the different gives and takes driving that number higher?", "Curt Hartman", "", "David, you\u2019re right. I did try to give some visibility and it is an immensely complex topic when you look at a network of 21 manufacturing plants. And I think if I go back to my opening comments here, a large percentage of our manufacturing is Euro cost based. ", "As currency moves, as the dollar appreciated against the euro and as you look at relative sales of our US \u2013 in the US market and as you look at our other markets where you saw currency fluctuation against the Euro like the Aussie Dollar or the Japanese Yen, when you look at those relative currency movements, when you look at the mix of products what they have in the markets, the uptake on those currency moves that hit the profits and the gross margin performance are far more significant than the downside pressure that you feel from that simple currency movement in the European market. ", "And I think if you go back to our 2009 10-K, and I think it\u2019s note 15, we break out the EMEA sales is roughly just below 20% of total sales. And keep in mind that\u2019s entire EMEA and you should assume Euro-based sales are smaller percentage than that. If you just that as a percentage to think about or the majority of our sales and therefore the majority of our profits are you can see a decrease and the manufacturing costs are going to have a substantial impact on the gross margin level. ", "I don\u2019t know if that helps you or confuses you. I can tell you it also gets in another factor that plays in here is the inventory turns by business unit and how those flow through. So there is progressive layering of the puts and takes as currency moves in any given quarter that are impacting the gross margin line across these various selling entities.", "Stephen MacMillan", "David, I\u2019ll probably just give a \u2013 a little other perspective on it. If you go back and you look at the years of, call it, \u201905, \u201906, \u201907, you know we were on steady march up on the gross margin piece. We then obviously took a detour as we invested heavily in our quality and compliance initiatives. And I think where we\u2019re hoping is we\u2019ve been saying is some of those investments would start yield additional benefits overtime. ", "And, you know, to me one of the real takeaways and the strengths of this quarter, people will look at and say, now wait a minute, there was a much higher mix of MedSurg, a lower mix of implants, and look at the margins we\u2019re getting. It does make us feel pretty good without overselling this particular quarter which was certainly unusually high that there\u2019s still a lot of power in this and I think that\u2019s certainly what you\u2019re getting at.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Steve, maybe, I\u2019ll ask you the recon question different way. There really are two issues as I see it. There was European disruption, distribute disruption, and then there was obviously delayed product cadence. At this point, where do you see greater visibility? Do you see greater visibility in regaining share or re-stimulating growth because of new products or you see a quicker fix to some of the European distribution disruption?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think we feel not great about the quarterly results, but very good about the direction we\u2019re on. And I think the visibility will become clear certainly in the second half of this year. Should our hip business start to be building momentum here in the third quarter? Yes. Is it going to suddenly leap up to double-digit growth? No. ", "This is going to be a freight train getting going on hips in the US, much as Triathlon did. I think you\u2019re going to see the same thing at Europe, I would dare say we think second quarter was the bottom for Europe and that\u2019s probably going to be \u2013 and I hate to use the Nike swoosh again, but I think we see probably our European business coming out in a swoosh like fashion again off the third quarter probably certainly better than the second, fourth quarter will be incrementally better than that.

We haven\u2019t seen any major changes in trends on our implant pricing. Clearly, it\u2019s being offset by better pricing and other businesses on the MedSurg to get to that total company price of down 1.5% and you can assume it\u2019s a little bit higher than that on the recon implant side.

Any color would be great.", "Curt Hartman", "Derrick, I think the story overall in MedSurg and you can apply this somewhat to medical is, number one on the disposal side, the volume trends there remain consistent. They remain at or above what I would call overall procedure trend, so that really has an impact on the endoscopy and instruments business. ", "On the capital side, which is where we felt most of the pressure at the end of \u201908 and certainly into 2009, we are seeing a return on the capital side, the capital equipment sales and purchases, I think that\u2019s evident both in the instruments and the endoscopy side, absent on the endoscopy side, the OR communication suites which have a longer build out. ", "And then, clearly, for our medical business, we noted that that we\u2019re seeing a consistent return on capital sales on beds, stretchers and the EMS platform. And I think what this is indicative of is these equipment segments that we sell into really on instruments and endo are part of the procedure, you can delay those purchases for a while, but as hospitals return to a more financially sound position, they\u2019re electing to reinvest any equipment that\u2019s generating the procedural volume. ", "In the medical side, it\u2019s the upgrades, it\u2019s the perhaps defined as smaller purchases than we may have seen mid 2008, but certainly the volume of purchases of capital expenditures is going up. And then, the internal metrics that we use to define hospitals in the state of capital liquidity has certainly improved over the first and second quarter of 2010. So overall, we like the trend. Again, we\u2019re being very cautious here. I don\u2019t see it returning to 2007 levels, but we certainly see a far more willingness to engage in conversation in purchase on the capital equipment side.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks.

But dollar really starting to or the Euro really started to fall off, I guess if I think about it that way, earlier this year and that, but coming back to the 130 level. But it sounds to me like you think those gross margin benefits just when that just cross currency issue could probably continue at least next two to three quarters. Is that a fair comment? ", "Curt Hartman", "Well, I think what I was trying to allude to is the way our inventory turns through our system in various products that inventory turns that impact month over month continues to layer up on the gross margin line. Some months, you have a positive variance. Some months, have a negative variance and it\u2019s the netting of all that that really drives your gross margins. But my comment relative to the rest of the year was that we felt the first half margin of 685 represented a very stable forward look. Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Bill Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity", "Great, thanks for taking my question. Just kind of curious as you look at MedSurg of US. it seems to be recovering a little slower in the US and given what's going over on over there on the macro issue, would you expect that recovery to take longer in general? Stephen MacMillan", "A little bit, I think the bigger issue is the US fell off faster and is therefore coming back faster. Europe never fell quite as deeply as the US and probably isn't therefore recovering quite as much. Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Harish with Needham & Company. Please proceed. Sameer Harish \u2013 Needham & Company", "Hi, guys. Good evening. Just kind of a follow up on some of the previous comments on terms of recon and spine. It seems like you\u2019re talking about common themes in terms of pricing pressure and competition and a refocus on the new product cycle, but we haven't seen as much detail on spine in terms of what those new product are going to be. Are the two new cervical plates enough to get to back into a growth trajectory or kind of \u2013 is there more behind the play there? Katherine Owen", "If you go back to some of the comments on the call the two cervical plates that we started launching in the first quarter but will take several quarters to fully rollout really fill some gaps in the bag, but they were important gaps in terms of really being able to have a full offering with customers. So, we wouldn't call those game changing innovations. We\u2019d call them important products to maintain a competitive product offering. ", "There's clearly more in our pipeline and new products that we expect to introduce and feel really good about the opportunities for innovation and spine. We haven't got into any details there or in really with any of our products that's really more just for competitive reasons. But that's not the end of the R&D story in spine, but it's the bulk of what will be rolling out this year. And again, going back to my comments I think you can assume spine is going to be facing some challenges for the better part of 2010. Sameer Harish \u2013 Needham & Company", "OK. And second question, I think some of your competitors have begun talking about of opportunities outside of the US and Europe as material contributes to growth in forward years. Where are you guys in terms of thinking about some of those other markets and when do you think they may start contributing? ", "Katherine Owen ", "We do have some efforts, but they're very much in the early stages under way and emerging markets. We are really refocusing in terms of the specific target markets that we're going to focus our efforts on. From a revenue contribution, it's not a material at this standpoint, but clearly just given the size of the opportunity and emerging markets, we\u2019re very much focused on leveraging our product portfolio and \u2013 but again at this point, it's still very much in early stages. Stephen MacMillan", "The reality is for all the pressures on the US, we still feel very good about the core US market. We have year-to-date double digit growth in the United States and we think there\u2019s great opportunity outside the US but we\u2019re not taking our eye off the US ball either. Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi. Thanks so much for circling around. I did have one additional follow-up and if I may, I\u2019m going to make that two follow-ups just so I don\u2019t get cutoff again. There was one question on beds, I think as someone drilled into the strength in the bed segment and ", "Curt, you gave some color and I appreciate that, but I didn't pick up a sense of to what degree construction is maybe picking back up or to what degree that was a factor. And then again, I have one follow-up. Curt Hartman", "Matt, you didn't miss it and you didn't pick it up because I didn't offer it. ", "Matthew Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Any color that you'd like to offer? Curt Hartman", "It's what I would call simply unqualified color. We have anecdotal information that there has been some re-emergence of reconstruction. It principally comes from those health systems that financially have been on and remain on some financial footing. It's certainly not at the level of '07, '06 and '05. Matthew Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "OK. And then the follow-up on orthopedics and with apologies for beating like being this dead horse, but I remember going back a couple of quarters, there was some talk about, and I remember hearing from folks in the surgeon community about some sense that patients were kind of in a, \u201cLet's get this procedure done before health care reform changes everybody's coverage,\u201d and we heard about that in December. We heard about it again in Q1 and now both of those quarters turned out to be pretty strong. ", "As Katherine mentioned, you guys have looked at this from all angles to try to figure out what the slowdown might be due to. Is that something you considered? Is that a factor at all, so we\u2019d be kind of in the middle of a little bit of a pause as we kind of catch back up midyear? Any color or thoughts would be appreciated. Katherine Owen", "I think as we look at the whole economic impact whether it was patients or patients losing jobs and not getting procedures done or worried about losing jobs and not getting procedures done or then the \"catch-up\" that may have an impact or have had an impact in any given quarter, but we've really view it on the margin. It's not something that we\u2019ve seen that's to any degree that we could really quantify it and call it out as that's causing some disruption in the quarter. ", "So to that point, as we get out a couple of quarters, could it look on the margin a little stronger and some of those patients come back and it's possible. We've really going to look at, \u201cIs there's some change in underlying patient demand? Is there some change in options for these patients as it relates to hip and knee procedures? Is there some big change on pricing?\u201d ", "And the answer to all of that is, no, which is a big part of what reinforces our belief that the, \u201cYes, in any given quarter, you'll see some anomalies around that mid-single-digit growth, but nothing that suggests we\u2019re seeing a real deviation away from it on a multi-quarter basis.\u201dOperator", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen MacMillan for closing remarks. Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you, Emity. Obviously, a lot of questions on certainly the recon side. I think we pulled a lot of people's attention back to our full-year, full company results that we feel very good about the plan we are on. Every quarter has full ups and downs. We certainly have a few this quarter and we'll be back to report on our third quarter 2010 operating results, that call will be held on October 19th, later this year, 2010. So, thank you, everybody.

The company\u2019s SEC filings may be accessed from the \u201cFor Investors\u201d page on the company\u2019s website at www.stryker.com.", "I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Stephen MacMillan, Chairman, President and CEO. Please proceed sir.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you, Jeremy. Good afternoon to everyone and welcome to Stryker\u2019s third quarter 2010 earnings report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "With three quarters of the year now complete, we once again recognized the benefits and strengths of our diversified revenue model. Following the late 2009 acquisition of Ascent, we now have nine key franchises that span a broad spectrum of the medical technology market. And although at any given point, these businesses are facing different challenges and opportunities.", "In totality, our unique footprint has a strong history of affording us with tremendous consistency in our financial results. And with the recent acquisition of Gaymar Industries, our medical division has further expanded its product offering and have strengthened its relevance to customers in the patient handling market. When we look back to the start of the year, we presented investors with our sales and earnings targets recognizing that some markets would likely outperform our expectations while others would inevitably fall short.", "Getting here today, our MedSurg franchises continue to post results that are better than we anticipated while recon market growth in the low single digits is at the lower end of anticipated ranges. It is no secret that the reconstructive implant market is seeing softer procedure growth in continued pricing pressure. Trends that were evident in Q2\u2019s results for the industry and were expected to continue into the third quarter.", "Although we are pleased that recon unit and price trends did not materially worsen in Q3. We hope and expect that the combination of our new hip products and the gradual recovery involvements will contribute to an improving market backdrop in the coming quarters. We are also encouraged that certain regions and divisions that have been underperforming including Europe and spine. Reversed course in Q3 had posted a sequential albeit modest acceleration in sales growth. All told, even in a period of challenged reconstructive growth, we are still delivering on our financial targets.", "In totality, our Q3 sales of modestly outperformed our forecasts and combined with continued margin improvement throughout our income statement that generated accelerated earnings growth. Importantly, as we remain committed to delivering top tier sales growth through innovation, it\u2019s paramount that we make the necessary investments in R&D which increased 18% year-over-year in the quarter on top of a 14% increase in the prior quarter.", "Year-to-date R&D spending is up to very strong 15%. This pace of reinvestment is a strong indication of our belief that many opportunities exist across our diverse set of businesses. We also remained steadfast in our focus on enhancing our quality and compliance systems as we embark on year three of the initial three year $200 million investment. The benefits of these investments are increasingly evident both internally and externally but much work remains to be done.", "The cultural change that\u2019s taken place at our company around quality and compliance can\u2019t be measured by the resolution of warning letters or the magnitude of dollars invested. Rather those are data points that validate our efforts and reinforce to all our 19,000 employees around the world that we are and will remain a fundamentally different company in how we think about quality and compliance and what it means to all our customers.", "Against this backdrop, we are enormously proud of the fact that we haven\u2019t wavered from the targets we offered in January despite continued economic uncertainty that has contributed the pockets of market weakness. We now look for full year sales in earnings to be towards the high-end of our targeted range, reinforcing the collective strength of our diverse franchises and underscoring the benefits of being a broad based player in the medical technology market.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call directly over to Curt.", "Curt Hartman", "Thanks Steve. Jumping into the third quarter results, we are pleased to report another solid overall company performance. Sales increased 6.9% on a reported basis and 7% excluding currency. The Ascent acquisition contributed 2.3% to our reported growth rate and for the first nine months has contributed 2.3% to our 9% reported growth.", "On the earnings side, another strong gross margin result and disciplined SG&A expense management allowed us to deliver a very respectable performance. We generated adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.80, an increase of 15.9% over Q3 2009 results. On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.85, an increase of 49% over Q3, 2009. Our reported GAAP earnings include $24.3 million gain, $13.4 million net of tax recorded in SG&A from the sale of our Caen, France facility and a $7.4 million favorable income tax expense adjustment associated with our December 2009 repatriation of foreign earnings.", "Additionally, GAAP earnings in the third quarter of 2009 included restructuring charges of $67 million, $48.4 million net of tax. Finally, the balance sheet remains healthy and we again demonstrated solid cash flow generation in the quarter.", "Turning to some specifics in the quarter, currency was effectively immaterial with the top line sales in this third quarter. Through the first nine months, currency has increased reported sales by approximately $67 million or 1.4%. Looking to the fourth quarter, currency moves to a modest headwind and if rates hold near quarter end levels, we would expect the fourth quarter sales impact to be approximately flat to down 1% when compared to 2009.", "Using quarter end rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales would be an increase in the range of 0.5% to 1% when compared to 2009. Next I\u2019ll discuss the impact of price and volume mix on the top line. In the quarter, companywide selling prices declined 1.8% on a worldwide basis, down 30 basis points from Q2. As we\u2019ve stated previously, we are focused on the total company pricing trends which provide a better overall snapshot of how market dynamics are impacting the company. However at the detail level on hip and knee front, we continue to see relatively modest pricing pressure that was not materially different in Q3 from what we saw in either Q2 or Q1. That same comment also applies to our spine segment recognizing the pricing pressure here is a bit greater than in our recon segment which has been the case for a number of quarters now.", "The number of selling days was effectively equal with 2009 in most markets. Looking at the business segments, I\u2019ll start with Orthopedic Implants, which represented 58% of our sales in the quarter. Orthopedic implants today is comprised of our hips, knees, trauma, spine, CMF and other implant segments.", "In the quarter, total orthopedic implants recorded a 1% increase in both the reported basis and in constant currency. At the segment level on a worldwide basis, hips reported growth of 2% in dollars and 1% in constant currency. In the US market, hip sales were up 3% while in international markets, hip sales decreased 1% on a constant currency basis.", "Finally, while hip sales in Europe were negative, they did improve marginally over Q2. Our global knee segment, sales were flat on both reported and constant currency basis. US knees reported 2% growth where OUS knees were down 5% on a constant currency basis. Amidst continued soft results European knee sales recorded their smallest declines on the year.", "Finally as you recall, we filed the 510(k) for OtisMed. And while we have been targeting a 2010 approval, at this point in the year a clearance appears more likely to occur in 2011. The global trauma segment was a bit softer in the quarter, recording to 2% increase in dollars and a 4% increase in constant currency. Our US trauma segment posted a 7% increase while our international trauma sales were up 1% on a constant currency basis.", "Our global spine segment continued to face challenges in the quarter but edged out a positive gain with a 1% increase on both the reported and constant currency basis. Our US spine sales were flat versus prior year while our international spine markets delivered constant currency growth of 4% in the quarter.", "Next, I\u2019ll turn to the MedSurg group which represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. MedSurg today is comprised of our instruments, endoscopy, medical, and Ascent Healthcare businesses. MedSurg reported another solid growth quarter with sales increasing 16% both as reported and on a constant currency basis. The Ascent acquisition added 6% to the reported increase, while the core MedSurg business segments delivered 10% reported growth in the quarter.", "We think that\u2019s an encouraging result, given this is our third consecutive quarter approximately 10% for MedSurg growth. Sales for the global instruments segment again posted strong results growing 13% in the third quarter on both the reported and constant currency basis. In the US market, the instrument segment reported a healthy 14% gain while internationally instrument sales also increased nicely recording a 11% gain in constant currency.", "Our endoscopy segment reported a sales increase of 7% and advanced 8% on a constant currency basis. In the US market, endoscopy sales were steady recording 8% growth. Internationally, endoscopy sales strengthened sequentially delivering at 6% constant currency gain.", "Finally, our medical segments saw global sales improve 8% in the quarter on both reported and constant currency basis. US medical sales increased 8% while our international medical sales increased 6% in constant currency. While the reported sales growth here is below recent quarter results, overall we feel good about the momentum in this business based on order trends and the benefit from the recently completed Gaymar Industries acquisition. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the results and trends from our MedSurg business segments in the quarter.", "I\u2019ll now turn to the remainder of the income statement, starting with our gross margin performance. Gross margins were again strong in the quarter at 69.4%, which represented a 200 basis point increase over third quarter 2009 levels. Frankly, the results exceeded our expectations with the improvement being paced by lower cost associated with inventory charges, solid production absorption and the favorable currency impact on cost from our Euro-based manufacturing network.", "Additionally, we again benefited from the multi-currency mix of our manufacturing and distribution activities. As a remainder, timing differences across our natural hedges and multi-currency mix prevent correlating currency movement on the top line with that of gross margin and profitability across quarters. For the year gross margins of 68.8% are slightly above our expectations and we expect the full year to remain in the 68.5% range given all the variables mentioned above.", "Research and development investments represented 5.6% of sales in the quarter, while increasing 18% over 2009 levels. For the year, R&D is now at 5.3% of sales and up 15% over prior year. Our commitment to increased R&D spending will continue and we anticipate fourth quarter investments to increase at rates well above our sales growth.", "Selling, general and administrative costs were flat compared with 2009 levels, while decreasing 250 basis points to 36.4% of sales versus 2009. During the quarter, we recorded a gain of $24 million associated with the sale of our orthopedic implant manufacturing facility in Caen, France. The gain on the sale of assets is included within SG&A. Net of this gain, SG&A finished at 37.8% of sales, decreasing a 110 basis points versus prior year.", "As a reminder, in the third quarter of last year, we reported $67 million of restructuring charges in operating expenses. These moves represent our ongoing commitment to evaluate our operating model to continue to drive focus and efficiency in our business. On a 7% constant currency sales growth, operating income increased 18% on an adjusted basis and 51% as reported. The adjusted operating margin increased robust 240 basis points versus prior to 25.3% of sales.", "Other income and expense reduced pretax income by $9 million in the quarter. Components of this included investment income of $12 million, offset by interest expense of $20 million and FX transactional losses of $1 million. Lower investment yields continue to limit earnings on our invested cash even with the higher cash balances. The company\u2019s effective income tax rate was 26.9% for the third quarter of 2010. In the third quarter, we reported a favorable income expense adjustment of $7 million associated with repatriation of foreign earnings undertaken into fourth quarter of 2009.", "Additionally, the tax rate also reflects the tax charge associated with the Caen facility sale. Absent those two items, the company\u2019s effective income tax rate was 27.6% in line with the historical trends.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $4.51 billion of cash and marketable securities of $1.56 billion from yearend of \u201809. As a remainder we have $1 billion of debt on the balance sheet associated with our January 2010 inaugural debt offering. Asset management remains under solid control as AR days ended the quarter at 59. This represents a decrease of two days compared to the prior year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at a disappointing 174 which was up 11 days sequentially versus the second quarter and 10 days against the prior year level. Excluding 2009, the third quarter has always been our historical high watermark for inventory. This year is a touch outside of that range and we are clearly expecting a stronger finish before the year is out.", "On cash flow, we continue to perform well with cash flow from operations of $428 million and free cash flow of $424 million. On the share repurchase program, we did not execute any additional repurchases in the quarter.", "In closing, we feel good about our results and the financial stability that our diverse base of businesses create for our company. Against these results and as provided in our press release, we have increased our full year performance expectations to the upper end of the targeted ranges to include a net sales increase of 7% to 8% in constant currency versus the previous 5% to 8% range. This will result in adjusted diluted net earnings per share now anticipated to be in the $3.27 to $3.30 range representing an increase of 11% to 12% over 2009 adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is versus the prior guidance of $3.20 to $3.30.", "In summary, our Q3 results have us firmly on track to deliver the high-end of the range we established back in January.", "I\u2019ll turn it now over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks Curt. In summary, we feel really good that despite less favorable market dynamics in some of our markets, we are again delivering at or near the top end of our commitments. The last few quarters underscore this strength provided by the breadth of our unique sales footprint. Additionally, we will continue to look for opportunities to leverage our balance sheet in order to strengthen our core as well as broaden our presence in adjacent markets. And our accelerated pace and investment in R&D will also drive internal innovation and help further broaden our portfolio of value-added products and services. In short, we like where we\u2019re headed.", "With that, we\u2019ll now open it up for Q&A. Jeremy, back to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Rick Wise of Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Rich [ph] \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Hi well this is Rich in for Rick. Thanks for taking the question. Great quarter. I just had a couple of questions, just to maybe start off when you talked about your overall pricing, you said it was down 1.8%. Is that just pure ASPs, is that your total pricing with mix or without mix?", "Curt Hartman", "Your assessment was correct. We said it was down 1.8%, 30 basis points down from what we reported in the second quarter and that\u2019s total company pricing independent of any specific segment call out.", "Stephen MacMillan", "It is without mix to your question.", "Rich \u2013 Leerink Swann", "And you still feel that mix is broadly offsetting that or capable of offsetting that for the foreseeable future?", "Curt Hartman", "We certainly believe that mix is still a positive component here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Thanks. Can you guys hear me okay.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes Bob, we can.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, great. So just two questions, one, Steve for you on pricing and then one follow-up as far as a broader question goes. First, on pricing we\u2019ve now seen results from you guys and BioMed and J&J and J&J talked about no real changing in pricing for hips and knees, BioMed said it got a lot worse in OUS but the same in the US. And now you guys are saying for hips and knees it\u2019s much the \u2013 pretty much the same that has been in the last couple of quarters. With that in mind and given what\u2019s going on around us in terms of the all the anecdotal evidence out there about the pressures on hospitals and the like. I was wondering Steve, if you could comment on your outlook for pricing for hips and knees for the market as we look forward into 2011. How confident are you that you think things can kind of stay in the same range versus perhaps get worse? Just would love your thoughts on the hip, knee pricing outlook for the market.", "Stephen MacMillan", "So Bob, I think we\u2019ve had three quarters that are actually pretty consistent now and probably bodes somewhat well at some point here in time as we have new products get launch, get more premiums, and as people come back into the markets, I think we\u2019re still more bullish on the markets longer term, but recognizing more of a choppy period right now and it\u2019s hard to exactly call the end. I think to me the big message is regardless of what keeps happening in this environment we keep delivering. And I think there has been (several) year, there has been so much focus and its back to like 2005 people looking at extreme, expecting extreme movements that frankly are not really occurring and that are again we can power through some of these changes.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. So basically not to put words in your mouth but as you look forward from what you see right now, you don\u2019t see a dramatic change in the outlook for pricing as it relates to hips and knees?", "Stephen MacMillan", "No comments.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay. And then the second question I just wanted to ask, there were some speculation inter quarter about certain asset that you guys might be considering buying and I don\u2019t expect you to comment on that but I was wondering if you would just take this opportunity to kind of refresh us on little bit more detail around your philosophy around the kinds of things that you may be interested, your philosophy around M&A and dilution and just kind of an update on that front, if you would especially in light of the cash that continues to build. Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "Hi Bob, its Katherine. I\u2019ll jump in here and really kind of reiterate what we\u2019ve articulated on prior calls and meetings which really speaks to a three-prong cash strategy. We continued to believe that M&A, it makes the most sense in terms of being our preferred use of cash but it\u2019s part of that three-prong M&A, dividends, share buybacks with any mix of those taking place. We haven\u2019t called out and we won\u2019t be any particular area that our focus other than to say that we continue to focus on our core as Steve mentioned on the call, we have a very unique broad set businesses that allow a lot of opportunities to leverage our core. I think Gaymar Industries is a terrific example of that.", "And we\u2019re also continuing to look at opportunities that are adjacent to our core markets and we would view the Ascent acquisition last year as an example of that. That has been the strategy we\u2019ve been executing on. And we don\u2019t have any plans to change that going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Good afternoon. Steve, your comments in the call were pretty clear that you saw some stabilization certainly in isolated pockets of the orthopedic market, your specific orthopedic segments in the US and OUS. Can you comment on, that stabilizations some very modest improvement, how those trends are sort of \u2013 how they trend to sort of inter quarters for August to September and perhaps into October. Are we still sort of in this stabilization mode to slight improvement, or have you seen a more sharp improvement?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, so I\u2019ll probably just jump in here. We have not probably not going to go down actually we\u2019re not going to go down on the path of inter quarter updates on trends really just focused on the quarterly trends and going back to the comments. We haven\u2019t seen anything materially change from Q1 to Q2 and that\u2019s probably the amount of granularity we want to get into.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, I\u2019m sorry Katherine, Q1 to Q2 but Q2 to Q3.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I\u2019m sorry so the comments for in Q3, we haven\u2019t seen anything materially different going back to the prepared comments from what we saw in out of Q1 or Q2.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, fair enough. And then Curt, just thinking about gross margins, obviously there was some inter geographical FX things driving GM improvements. But if we look at a go-forward basis, some of your higher margin products are underperforming right now. Is it safe to assume to an extent you can see stabilization in growth in those products going forward or we should start seeing more significant mixed impact in the P&L which would be positive for GMs heading into \u2018011.", "Curt Hartman", "David, it\u2019s a great question and I think it gets into where the gross margins are for those products that you\u2019re referencing and the stability. Stability is different than growth and obviously the more volume we put through on those, the better the gross margins are going to be. So I think it\u2019s a little bit early to call those returning and being contributing factors at this point in time, because we would like to see more growth out of them before we\u2019d comment on additional influence to gross margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Hi thanks for taking our questions. I just \u2013 if I could just clarify couple of things that you said your last question and David\u2019s question on volume and pricing, Katherine or Steve just it sounds like you\u2019ve seen pricing that has kind of, it\u2019s not much different in Q3 than it was in Q1 or Q2. Clearly volumes right, took a step down in Q2 from Q1. And so I guess then on the volume side you\u2019re saying that from Q2 to Q3 things that didn\u2019t get materially worse. Is that what I heard you say Steve?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I think that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll just jump in here, I think that\u2019s a correct statement. Clearly volumes are seeing the impact from the economic environment, people deferring surgeries, recognizing all our checks indicate this isn\u2019t something you can permanently defer although clearly calling the quarter when those volumes start to improve. It\u2019s a bit tough. It\u2019s just something that we would anticipate happening as we go forward but no material change on that front either from \u2013 versus what we saw in Q2 as it relates to volumes.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "Great. And I had one on the P&L and one just so maybe some color on OUS trauma. So in terms of what opportunities you have either that you\u2019re executing on in kind of this modest growth top line environment certainly in devices. If you could talk about what kind of restructuring efforts you have underway, anything it could do to sort of quantify what they could mean for the P&L over the next quarter or next going forward. And then just as a follow-up US \u2013 OUS trauma little on the weak side, I\u2019d love to know how much of that was volume, was it comps, was it Japan pricing, that would be helpful. Thanks.", "Curt Hartman", "Matt, this is Curt. On the, I think to use your word you said the projects, we\u2019re probably not going to get into any specifics. I think the message we want out is that as demonstrated over the past year, as a normal part of our business routine, we\u2019re constantly evaluating our operating models and making adjustments were appropriate. And we\u2019re not going to pin a number out there and drive our business to that number rather we\u2019re going to continue to evaluate the operating model and make the adjustments as necessary. On the trauma in the OUS component or the slower growth OUS, I don\u2019t think there is one thing we would point to here. It\u2019s certainly not, I wouldn\u2019t be pointing to Japan price cuts those had far less impact on trauma this year than they did in the other segments of the business.", "So I don\u2019t think we\u2019d point to Japan as a key driver there. There is a little bit all over the board. Just I think generally what we would say is third quarter was a little bit slower trauma season if you will.", "Stephen MacMillan", "And I\u2019ll jump, Jeremy I\u2019ll just jump in with an addition point here Matt. The back on the projects, I\u2019d give an example, just the constant evolutionary changes we make. Recall, last year we discontinued a series or products in our knee franchise for Europe. We\u2019ve been paying the price on the top line growth rate for this year. But from a bottom line profitability, we had always decided that was going to make us stronger for the company. We\u2019re constantly doing a lot of things like that that aren\u2019t obviously but that we do sometimes pay a price for in terms of reported sales growth and not just going for a sales growth at all costs as we get smarter. And frankly the whole quality initiative that we\u2019ve been through has helped China much brighter light for us on some of those opportunities and has resulted in some of those actions. That did frankly were depressing pieces of our growth rates for periods of times when we went through this but we really do think are making us fundamentally stronger as a company.", "So hopefully Matt that gives a little more context to you. All right, go ahead Jeremy, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Adam Feinstein from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yes, thank you. Good afternoon everyone. I guess just a follow-up with some of the other questions here, I mean clearly the growth outlook within the core ortho recon business is lower for everyone and certainly you guys have done a good job of managing through it but clearly this seems like lower than normalized growth rate. So with that backdrop, I mean what do you guys think the implications are in terms of strategy, competitive backlash and certainly your comments earlier about acquisitions being the first choice in terms of your use of cash. Would it be safe to assume that acquisitions would be outside of ortho business similar to what you guys had been doing but is that point I guess going to be a bigger area of focus just due to the delivered growth right here. So kind of a bigger picture question there but just curious as you guys think about that what do you think the implications are?", "Katherine Owen", "Okay, I\u2019m going to take part six of the question.", "Adam Feinstein \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Okay.", "Katherine Owen", "And in just terms of the M&A and really just go back to what we articulated in the beginning. We\u2019re really not going to focus on specific areas other than reiterating what we\u2019ve tried to express throughout the year in various meetings. We\u2019re focused on our core, Gaymar and we\u2019re focused adjacent, Ascent being an example of that but as you get down really granular looking at different divisions in the like of, it just doesn\u2019t make sense for a lot of reasons for us to comment on particular areas or segments or strategic responses to market dynamics that we may address with M&A.", "Stephen MacMillan", "And Adam I\u2019ll take the rest of those the question. I think we look at it on a couple of different fronts. If this is a cyclical downturn in the orthopedic implant marketplace, I think you want to really good about our position as a company that we can deliver these kind of results with two straight quarters of 1% orthopedic implant growth as those markets come back, you got to feel really good about what we can do. And if it\u2019s a more secular downturn, I can also tell you we\u2019ve got plans in place for that that we think will benefit the larger players and frankly some of the players who transcend a number of segments in orthopedics.", "And we have different plans and different approaches for that way. So I think we actually don\u2019t \u2013 I mean none of us love a market downturn, but to some degree it may allow us to differentiate. We think we may differentiate ourselves more through this period than just a rising tide on everything.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please proceed.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Hi guys, just the first question, I was wondering if you could give us any more details on the increased R&D investment we\u2019re seeing here. Any particular segments where that\u2019s focused? Are these longer term bets or more of a refresher product line that we could see the benefits of in 2011?", "Curt Hartman", "Steve, this is Curt. I\u2019ll take a quick stab at this and Steve or Katherine may also contribute here, but I think fundamentally every one of our operating businesses is looking at both incremental innovation because the market still drives for incremental innovation product enhancements, additional features and benefits but I also think that there is probably game changing innovation that\u2019s going on as well. So I wouldn\u2019t slice our R&D investment into one specific aspect of innovation. I\u2019d say rather each of our operating businesses have unique features and benefits that are driving in a given product line but I think they\u2019re also looking for more what we would call true innovation.", "Some of the stuff that maybe qualified as perhaps a little bit further out than what the normal business is operated on but still things that we feel add value over the long-term.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay, great. And then just secondly the OtisMed slight push out there, any sense of whether this is related to the warning letter trend we saw with other manufacturers in patient specific instruments or just a little more time needed specifically with the OtisMed 510(k).", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to comment on what the FDA\u2019s processes or how they\u2019re viewing some of the competitive products. But it\u2019s clearly as everybody knows it becomes a more challenging market to get 510(k) clearances, PMA approval, nobody in that tech is immune to that. We feel very good about the submission in our ability to respond to questions but trying to forecast that at an exact time is currently challenging. And we just figure at this point in the year it made more sense to start thinking about a clearance coming in 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi thanks for taking the question. One of the concerns around pricing from a kind of a secular perspective has been that a lot of hospitals are moving towards kind of a capitative pricing structure where they are sitting one set cost for a certain cost of hips in saying if the vendor wants to participate at the hospital they must meet that level. And \u2013 but I haven\u2019t seen though any real statistics on how prevalent that is and I was just wondering if you could speak as to how much of you customer \u2013 in your customer base how much what percent of hospitals you\u2019re seeing that might have this kind of structure in place and is this concern that investors should be focused on or is this such a small percentage that it\u2019s not that big of a deal yet.", "Katherine Owen", "I think it\u2019s like a lot of industries in med tech and certainly in our hip and knee business, you\u2019re always going to have certain hospital accounts that try and drive very strict pricing or try and limit the number of vendors and on the other hand you have other hospitals who are really looking to ensure that they have access to the latest innovation, have carve outs in contracts. So it\u2019s very difficult to make a blanket statement that x percent of accounts are approaching pricing from a capitated way or otherwise. What we do see is manageable pricing pressure that hasn\u2019t materially changed in the hip and knee market which should give you some sense of what\u2019s happening in the larger hospital market and seeing a portion of that all set by mix which also indicates these same hospital customers are willing to pay for innovation.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Okay, thanks. And then on MedSurg, so on the equipment you saw a nice sort of acceleration in sequential growth rates on the bed side, you saw a step down from kind of that the blip that we saw over the last two quarters. Maybe if you could just give us a little color as to what you see driving those and how you think about those moving out over the next few quarters?", "Curt Hartman", "Derrick, I think our comments on MedSurg, we overall feel good about the core MedSurg franchises, endoscopy instruments and medical. And I think if you think about endo and instruments, it shows capital sales that had evaporated in 2009 that have started to return and I referenced back to a comment that Steve has made about the shape of that curve and what it\u2019s looking like. And I think we\u2019re seeing those businesses move exactly on that curve. And on the medical side it is a little bit more difficult to predict and I think our comments on medical were that while the shipment growth rate was a little bit lower, we feel pretty good about the incoming orders volume as well as the additive impact that the Gaymar Industry acquisition will have on that business.", "So I think the overall high level tone on MedSurg is we feel good about the trends, feel good about the outlook here and really like these businesses when they\u2019re operating at that 10% growth level. And don\u2019t see anything right now that\u2019s going to change that.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Okay, Derrick just to reinforce that point, after the second quarter there were a lot of people wondering, okay, great you got a one quarter pop or two quarter pop in MedSurg. To remind you that we\u2019ve had years and years of strong performance in MedSurg and 2009 happened to be outlier, to reiterate Curt\u2019s point, I think (inaudible).", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies", "Hi good afternoon.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Hi Raj.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies", "What if I could ask about Europe. It\u2019s been a couple of quarters now you\u2019ve been feeling the impact of the distributor change out and some of the product discontinuations you mentioned. I\u2019m curious if you could provide us an update on where we are in that cycle, I mean should we be anniversarying those trends fairly sooner or is this going to continue for a couple of more quarters here?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure Raj, its \u2013 we really took the charge at the end of the third quarter last year, so started the downturn in the fourth. And we\u2019re close to the end of some of that full anniversary period. Some of that will trickle into the fourth quarter. So I think by the end of this year certainly those distributor changes in product pieces should be behind us. I think what we\u2019re pleased with is, there was a clear albeit modest improvement in our European business that went from negative in the second quarter. We think we bottomed out in the second quarter. We had modest growth in the third quarter here in Europe. So we\u2019re not declaring victory by any stretch but we think we have bottomed out.", "Raj Denhoy \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay and then just one last one, you know the margin improvements continue to be quite impressive. I\u2019m curious, are we seeing any benefit from the warning letters being lifted here, are any of those expenses coming off?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I would not view it as the expenses coming off, I would say we have learned a lot frankly around things like product design that have led to more efficient product designs and other things. But the gross margin, I\u2019ll let Curt build on this, gross margin be careful not to get too far ahead yourselves on that one. We had some currency issues \u2013 some favorable currency that dollar has now crept back up. There were \u2013 the last couple of quarters were probably unusually high. We\u2019re not quite ready to declare that that\u2019s our new ongoing level but we do think we\u2019ll continue to move it forward. Curt, do you want to build on that?", "Curt Hartman", "Steve I think you hit the nail right on the head. I would not read into any gross margin improvements that dial back on the quality investment. I think Steve tried to make that really clear in his opening comments that we remain very committed here. We\u2019re just entering the year three of the program we laid out and we\u2019re very committed to that and the gains that we may be seeing as they related to quality are probably some of the efficiencies that enhance quality processes are enabling our manufacturing plans to be more efficient to have reductions in scrap and things of that nature that come through the broad implementation of those programs.", "Stephen MacMillan", "It\u2019s painful as it was to get four warning letters and go through what we went through over the last few years. We really do believe it\u2019s making us a better company. Look, we still got a lot of investment to make. I think we see those opportunities paying off down the road.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vivian Cervantes from Maxim Group. Please proceed.", "Vivian Cervantes \u2013 Maxim Group", "Hi thank you for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on the comment you had made on secular changes to the recon market and that having some plans on how to deal with that. Can you sort of balance that out vis-\u00e0-vis expectations of volume trends and I know you said that its been relatively flat but volume trends that will continue to be pressured into near to mid-term. How do you sort of pull on what levers to sort of figure out secular versus prolonged cyclical pressure?", "Stephen MacMillan", "From a planning standpoint, we\u2019re going to assume pricing pressure is a more secular event and that we can manage through that and volumes I think we think are probably a little more cyclical. Things like the unemployment rates being high, COBRA benefits going away all of that. At the end of the day, joint replacement surgery is deferrable to a point. But I don\u2019t think we see it just completely going down and people starting to live life on nonsteroidals and high (organic) acid. There is only so long you can defer it. So I think that\u2019s probably a little more cyclical.", "Vivian Cervantes \u2013 Maxim Group", "All right. And as a follow-up when you mention deferrable up to a point, are you noticing that maybe this point of deferrals has been extended, are we talking maybe six months deferral to maybe a year or has there really been no change in your thinking about how long you can defer (piece of this) surgery?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Vivian it\u2019s just hard to quantify at this point, I think we\u2019d be hitting ourselves we said we anticipated the complete slowdown that we\u2019ve experienced in the last two quarters. And so whether it continues for another couple of quarters or another year who knows what in terms of how long people can put it off, I mean ultimately we\u2019d probably think its quarters, years, year-ish but people are unemployed for a while. They\u2019re concerned about going in or don\u2019t have the benefits that we really have to see. I think I\u2019d just come back to the fact that we are more than a hip and knee company. We love those businesses, but this quarter again as last quarter and as years of performance should show, we are not beholden to the growth rates (inaudible).", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you very much for taking my question. Actually there is two, one you\u2019ve talked about the hospital purchasing recovery being sort of a Nike swoosh. Are you still seeing that sort of pattern on where we own that design. And then the second one is in the spring you launched several new products at AAO, the ADM hip, new cervical plates, kyphoplasty products. Could you give us a little bit of qualitative information on how those maybe doing? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "I\u2019ll take the latter part of the question first and I think I\u2019ll put it against the context, if you would look at the total company and what we\u2019ve articulated at prior meetings, the academy our analyst meeting is it\u2019s a series of singles and doubles. It\u2019s very rarely the homerun type of product and but it\u2019s the collective total of all those products that really allows for the top line growth. And we would view all of those products that\u2019s in line with that. On the hip side as many of you know and we\u2019ve talked about it. It\u2019s the rollout of a new hip system particularly something like ADM that is a new design. Concept does take several quarters typically at least four quarters, certainly what we\u2019ve seen historically and with the launch of Triathlon that\u2019s been tremendously successful.", "It takes four plus quarters to really get the message out there, surgeons trained starting to use the product, etcetera. And that\u2019s the path that ADM and the other products that we\u2019ve launched around. So overall we feel very good that they are delivering what we would anticipate but recognizing none of these in isolation is going to dictate the performance in a given quarter.", "Curt Hartman", "And I think Joanne to your first question relative to MedSurg in where we are in that swoosh, if you will. I think we continue to trend, I think there are still segments. I\u2019ll use our endoscopy business as a great example. We feel very good about the capital sales results that are starting to materialize there. With that said we\u2019ve also said in prior quarters that the communications business which is an element of the endoscopy business still has a little bit more pressure on it because the capital ticket item there is much larger.", "So there are still elements of our capital franchises that are little slower but overtime we think they\u2019ll recover as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell from UBS. Please proceed.", "Bruce Nudell \u2013 UBS", "Thanks for taking my questions. Just Steve qualitatively it\u2019s our impression that hospitals when face with pressure basically try to control implant cost basis or lever they could easily pull but on the other hand they love surgery because that\u2019s where they make their money. Where are they in there thinking have profits internally as the hospital started to improve enough non-operating revenue etcetera so that they feel they are planning ahead now or are they just refurbishing stuff they\u2019ve deferred or little of both. And then I guess on the second question is just structurally when you sit down and do your strat planning given the realignments that are going on. Do you think about the major joint market across price and mix as a zero percent ASP inflation thing or do you think it\u2019s going to be slightly positive or slightly negative. Thanks a lot.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Well the first one was I think we \u2013 it clearly varies a lot by hospital so it\u2019s hard to give a blanket answer. I think there are number of larger institutions that really do grasp the total joint replacement surgery is actually a very good profit center for them. And I think what you had certainly in the advent of passage of the Healthcare Bill this year, I think everybody coming running for the corners trying to get every cost that they could and then you have people starting to wake up and say wait a minute, there are pieces of the business that we make a lot of money in. And I always joke, if you can\u2019t drive across the State of Michigan without seeing at least 10 billboards for hospitals advertising somehow the total joints done at their centers. Last I checked I don\u2019t think they\u2019re advertising those if they\u2019re losing money much on those.", "So I think there is still little more profitability that will shake out and particularly among the larger institutions. Some of the smaller community hospitals are still certainly pressured to that end. To your second point, I think we still ultimately believe that mix will be able to more than offset pricing degradation and we\u2019ll see some certainly volume growth in the sector.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Hi good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. My first question is another, I guess longer term question. Turning over to the MedSurg side of the business, while many are concern that reform efforts in the US could actually lead to direct or indirect pricing pressures many have alluded to. I think there is the belief that volumes could pick up and you actually could see some expansions in certain areas in terms of hospital building and build outs. Have you thought about the potential for Obama care actually benefiting your MedSurg business and maybe offsetting some of the areas of potential concern on the recon side?", "Curt Hartman", "Doug, I think it\u2019s certainly potential and have we thought of it. Yes, we\u2019ve had lots of discussions about the Healthcare Reform Act and how it will either positively or negatively impact our business. Again I think on one sense that and you can put whatever number you want to, it\u2019s the $30 million additional insured lives, I think our opinion would be a lot of those are already getting healthcare. They are just getting it under a different form than the insurance proposal that\u2019s out there and on the other hand if there is a better way that requires additional equipment, we\u2019re certainly there and ready to support that expansion on the market.", "I don\u2019t think at this point in time we\u2019re banking on anything one way or the other perhaps except the excise tax that we know very clearly is going to be an adverse event for companies in the med tech space.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Doug to build on that for all the pricing pressure we may feel here in now, I think the one thing we would absolutely bet on is there is going to be more money spent on healthcare going forward both in the United States and around the world.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to focus on MedSurg, and I guess two questions. MedSurg has been so volatile for the last two years, it was obviously at a much stronger downturn in the first, for the three quarters of 2009. And we all are expecting had this much stronger up turn and you were expecting company was expecting. Can you have visibility on the whole question of inventories. It would seem that there could have been some inventory drawdown and so in terms of not about your inventories, I\u2019m talking about the hospitals inventories but how they are managing them and how they are facing about particularly on the instrument side on the endoscope side.", "And do you think there was drawdown in 2009, maybe we\u2019re getting some bounce back in 2010. And then from there the second piece is how do we think about your comp \u2013 your contribution within MedSurg from volume mix and price and if you can give us any sense of what that 16% constant currency broke, how that breaks down that\u2019d be great. Thanks.", "Curt Hartman", "So Mike on the first question, I\u2019m not sure if I would say that \u201809 was an inventory drawdown, I\u2019ll kind of start my questions or my answer with on medical it was a flat out, we\u2019re not buying right now. And that\u2019s on capital equipment purchase. On endoscopy and instruments, as you\u2019re aware they both have disposable components of the business that component of the business is what I would call very real time. They either ordered direct from Stryker or they go through various distribution partners that have very real time inventory levels that are maintained through par level management.", "It was the capital equipment in \u201809 in those businesses that slowed down and that was either the capital equipment replacement or expansion cycle that slowed down. And now we\u2019re starting to see as a return of those investments. It\u2019s a deferral that can only be deferred for so long because you\u2019re fundamentally re-channeling new dollars into repair dollars and you can only do that for so long. So I think we\u2019re just seeing those healthy institutions needing equipment replacement cycles to occur and that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving those businesses right now along with our normal stream of new product introductions that go on in those businesses.", "As far as the 16% I think that we called out that 6% of that came from Ascent. So my first slice would be 6% is the acquisition. The remaining 10% I would say that that we\u2019re not going to get into price specific commentary relative to those three segments. And it\u2019s all wrapped into that 1.8% decline that total company felt. So it probably gives you an indication that pricing pressure in MedSurg is no worse or no better than what it\u2019s been on a historical basis. Again the cycles for new products innovation at MedSurg are a little bit shorter because majority of items are 510(k) so you probably getting a little bit better mix out come in those businesses as the new product pipeline coming out of the quality remediation efforts continues to ramp up and new items hit the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Novaro from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Glenn Novaro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Hi, two quick questions, one on the surgical equipment side, I mean those sales came in well above our forecasts. And I was just wondering, where there any one-timers or big purchases on the quarter is question one. And then on, okay and then on the M&A side maybe to ask the question a little bit differently, the fact that you\u2019re not buying back stock. Does that mean like the queue of M&A is pretty full at the moment? Thanks.", "Curt Hartman", "Glenn, we\u2019re probably not going to get into many specifics here other than to go back to what I think Katherine tried to lay out pretty clearly at the beginning which was we prefer to use our cash for M&A but we do have a three-pronged approach which includes dividends and repurchase in M&A. And those are in addition to the normal working capital requirements of our business. So really what we hope is that over time when you look at all three of those elements you see the best possible investment leading to the best possible returns for shareholders by being very judicious in how we assign dollars in each of those categories versus one specific bucket in any given quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi thanks for taking my question. I was just wondering it light of the (med tech) panel which was a couple of months ago if you guys have updated your thinking on OP-1.", "Stephen MacMillan", "We\u2019ve said we\u2019ll give you an update by the end of the year and we\u2019re on track to do that.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then obviously with MedSurg the comparisons year-over-year are a little bit easier, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as you guys look at the business, where do you think more normalized run rate is at. Do you feel confident that it can be mid-single digits as we look ahead obviously we\u2019re going to be anniversarying some tough trends but where do you think MedSurg overall can grow up?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We absolutely think it can be in mid-single digits. No problem.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Please proceed.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "Thank you, good afternoon. Steve, let me just follow-up I guess on your last answer there, no problem on the mid-single digit MedSurg meaning you could foresee it being higher than that as well fairly easily?", "Katherine Owen", "I would go back to when we gave the revised guidance for the full year up to the upper end of the range I don\u2019t think anybody is assuming some dramatic reacceleration in the recon market. Our comments spoke to the fact expected to improve over time than we\u2019ve got one quarter left. So kind of gives you some sense about what\u2019s going to be driving the components to get to that revised guidance.", "Jeff Johnson \u2013 Robert Baird", "Yes, understood Katherine on that, I guess Steve, sounded pretty confident there though just wondering maybe qualitatively longer term its mid-single digit kind of the base of what your expectations would be, Steve?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We\u2019re not getting into longer term guidance at this point Jeff, we\u2019ll give just 2011 guidance in January but I just pointed out, we\u2019ve got a long, long history of building very good MedSurg businesses and we continue to believe in those businesses.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please proceed.", "Bill Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord", "Very thanks. Just a couple of questions here, one you talked about the discontinue of some products in Europe and I know you addressed the distribution changes. Is it fair to say as we go through 2011, we\u2019ll be clean in on the comps and see more normalized growth rate and then two, just kind of on the hospital you did talked a little about pricing the way they\u2019re thinking. Has there been any change in the way that they look at carve outs and think about that and maybe either include or exclude that as you go to negotiations with them in the future? Thanks that\u2019s all.", "Katherine Owen", "So I\u2019ll take the second question first, no there has been real change in terms of how hospitals think about carve outs and wanting to be able to have access to innovation as a lot of business positions preference item as you look at the hip and knee market. And in terms of the first part of your question.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Bill the first part of the question really distributor and product obsolescence that does specifically relate to Europe and we are sun setting those events and really would not expect to see any of that on an adverse side as we head into 2011. That said as I mentioned earlier, we continue to evaluate our business and will take opportunities to make adjustments where appropriate but we have with this quarter now sunsetted the changes in Europe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Charles Chon from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Charles Chon \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Great, thanks for taking the question. Hits in the US awesome, nice sequential acceleration which is a different sequential trajectory for what we\u2019ve been seeing from other companies. Can you speak a little more about what drove that sequential improvement? Was it volumes and, or maybe you guys launched some products earlier this year, it could be mix?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We\u2019re getting to get some traction with our new product.", "Charles Chon \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus", "Okay and the follow-up questions is actually similar one for US spine again transforming out there. Is that also volume driven or is that new product mix driven?", "Katherine Owen", "I would just caution the sequential improvement in spine although it\u2019s better than a sequential decline. It\u2019s still very modest, that business was flat domestically. So we\u2019ll look for that to gradually get better but I think way too early to ring any bells that new products are having a meaningful impact.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Even hips was only \u2013 it was a little bit better. We\u2019re not declaring victory on that one.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew O\u2019Brien from William Blair. Please proceed.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien \u2013 William Blair", "Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on that last question a little bit, when do you think, we\u2019ll start to really see the firm traction from those new hip products. Is it a kind of Q1, Q2 event in \u2018011 or a bit further out?", "Katherine Owen", "As we talked about earlier in the call, is we think about reconstructive market in a long history of having product rollouts here. It typically takes four plus quarters before new products starts to get meaningful traction and we\u2019ve rolled these products out during the first quarter. So we would really look to start to see more of an impact in 2011.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien \u2013 William Blair", "Okay and then just one, just one last one, everybody is focused on the pricing dynamic right now and the offset on the mix but what leverage do you have to offset further pricing declines, be it service or elsewhere from these levels say if it was to go from kind of a negative 2% where it\u2019s been in this quarter to negative 4% or something along those lines just going forward.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Look at this way, we went from a positive several percent a couple of years ago, down to zero to minus 2% and we\u2019ve continued to grow pretty healthy through that. We continue to look both at the gross margin line, in terms of the cost of goods side as well as frankly at the middle of the P&L. And I think we continue to feel that we can deliver in whatever environment is coming at us.", "Operator", "And our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Topher Roy [ph] \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "It is actually Topher Roy in for David Roman. I had a quick question about CapEx spending in Europe, kind of where you guys saw it over the past quarter, where you guys see that going for the next six months and kind of how it relates to how domestic spending. Thanks.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Our instruments business had a pretty quarter in Europe. A little bit of capital, little bit of disposables. I think frankly we\u2019re still not that exposed to the capital market in Europe. We don\u2019t really have much of a medical business there. Our endo and instruments businesses are heavily disposable in some capital. So even if it comes down a little bit, I think again I think what it remained everybody of is with our diverse footprint, one of these things knocks us out one way or the other and people freak about whether its hip pricing or knee pricing in the United States or Japan, capital spending in Europe and all these things. And I think again we just somehow quarter-after-quarter feel pretty good about our ability to muddle through these.", "I think with that Jeremy that was the final question as well I believe, right?", "Operator", "That\u2019s correct sir. There are no more questions.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Great. I think that probably wraps it up reasonably well. And again I think we continue to deliver. And we will be back with you to report our fourth quarter with mostly our full year operating results on January 25th of 2011. Thank you everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

My name is Melanie, and I'll be your coordinator today. [Operator Instructions].", "Before we proceed, the company would like to remind you that certain statements made in today's conference call may contain information that includes or is based on forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities law that are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, weakening of economic conditions that could adversely affect the level of demand for the company's products; pricing pressures, generally, including cost containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the company's products; changes in foreign exchange markets; legislative and regulatory actions; unanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and otherwise that affect U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of new products; changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payers; a significant increase in product liability claims; unfavorable resolution of tax audits; changes in financial markets, changes in the competitive environment; and the company's ability to integrate acquisitions. ", "Additional information concerning these and other factors are contained in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen McMillan, Chairman, President and CEO. Please precede, sir.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you, Melanie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's Fourth Quarter 2010 Earnings Report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. ", "Before delving into the quarterly specifics, we'd like to highlight the major strategic milestones achieved in 2010 that have helped transform our company in ways that we think will be critical, not only in navigating through the current environment, but also positioning ourselves well for the future. I'll then pass the call over to Katherine and Curt to go into the specifics regarding our Q4 results before we open the call up to your questions.", "2010 was a pivotal year for our company with a number of key accomplishments that in total underscore our unique competitive strengths and that we believe will allow us to deliver top-tier results in both the short and long term. ", "First, we continued to make major investments in our quality and compliance systems, entering year three of the initial program that is driving myriad benefits to our company and our customers. In 2010, investors were able to see the tangible results of these considerable investments with resolution of the remaining three FDA warning letters. This achievement represented an important milestone for our organization and signaled to us that the path that we've been on is focused and resourced appropriately, recognizing there remains room for improvement and will continue to have quality as a top priority within our organization. Simply put, we've used the challenges we faced to ensure that quality and compliance become embedded in our cultural DNA, and that the focus we've put in place over the last few years does not waver.", "We also continue to optimize our capital allocation. With us now generating over $1.5 billion in cash flow from operations annually, we are not limited to a single option, but rather are able to execute on our multipronged cash deployment goals. This includes the ability to both invest for long-term sales growth via acquisitions, while also maximizing shareholder return through dividends and buybacks. ", "Following the acquisition of the Neurovascular division from Boston Scientific, we have invested $2.3 billion since the start of 2008 in a series of M&A targets that have both strengthened our core franchises, while also further diversifying our company into some of the fastest growth segments of med tech. During that same time, we have also returned nearly $600 million to our shareholders through dividends plus executed over $1.5 billion in share repurchases. ", "Building on the capital allocation achievements, we closed a number of meaningful acquisitions over the past 12 months, culminating with the Neurovascular deal that now positions us as the global leader in the roughly $1 billion Neurovascular market. With new product launches already underway and a history of delivering innovation, we are excited to have this team as part of the Stryker family. ", "Beyond acquisitions, we also made the strategic decision to sell OP-1 for use in orthopedic bone applications, a move that allows us to redirect the R&D to other internal projects, which we believe offer the potential for greater shareholder returns, including clinical efforts already underway with BMP-7 for potential use in osteoarthritis and research into other non-orthopedic applications. Combined, our acquisitions and divestitures have further strengthened our sales footprint, while simultaneously sharpening our R&D efforts.", "Turning to our decentralized business model, it remains a critical aspect of our competitive advantage and ability to drive consistently strong results. However, as we have grown the top line to over $7 billion in sales, more than doubling our revenues since 2003, aspects of our structure have resulted in inefficiencies in certain areas, and we have opportunities to better leverage our scale. We have taken a number of steps over the past 18 months to put the infrastructure in place and to prioritize areas of opportunity. Although this initiative will have negligible earnings impact of next year or two, longer term, we believe it will provide us with additional P&L leverage that can be redeployed into sales, marketing, R&D or to offset the potential for greater pricing pressure.", "And finally, our financial results. At the start of the year, we targeted to deliver constant currency sales growth of 5% to 8% and per-share earnings of $3.20 to $3.30, representing an 8% to 12% increase. Clearly, the slow pace of the economic recovery and its greater-than-anticipated dampening effect on elective surgeries was challenging during the year. Nonetheless, the diversity of our sales footprint that spans a number of key segments in medical technology allowed us to navigate through those challenges and achieve sales growth of the high end of the targeted range, coming in at a solid 8%, excluding foreign exchange. We parlayed the high single digits sales growth into a robust 13% increase in adjusted diluted per-share earnings to $3.33, surpassing the top end of the EPS range we set out at the start of 2010.", "Additionally, to further underscore our belief in our future growth prospects, we significantly boosted our R&D spending by 17% in 2010, including a more than 20% increase in the fourth quarter, as we continue to see numerous and exciting opportunities for growth in all of our franchises. With 2011 now underway, we are highly focused on continuing to execute on our financial commitments. Given the underlying strength of our core franchises, coupled with the benefits from a number of strategic acquisitions and the flexibility afforded by our balance sheet, we believe we are well-positioned to achieve 11% to 13% constant currency sales growth in 2011. Excluding both FX and the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, we look to deliver 5% to 7% sales growth. We remain committed to translating our revenue gains into double-digit earnings growth targeted at 10% to 12%. ", "Although 2011 will undoubtedly present its own challenges, there will also continue to be opportunities that can be maximized by our focus on innovation, execution and investing. Our company has a long history of realizing superior financial results, and we expect this year will be no different. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Steve. My comments today will focus on several areas, including acquisitions, elective procedure trends and implant pricing and, finally, MedSurg trends. ", "On the acquisition front, we completed four deals in 2010, including three core deals with the instrument acquisition of the SONOPET aspirator, our CMF group acquiring Porex Surgical and the medical acquisition of Gaymar Industries. All three deals further broadened the relevant franchise product offering and allow us to leverage our existing sales forces. As we've discussed previously, our M&A strategy is focused on both leveraging our core businesses, while also moving into key adjacent markets. The early January closing of the Boston Neurovascular division is clearly an example of the latter, and we're excited about the long-term growth prospects that this market-leading franchise offers. ", "Just prior to our announcement of the definitive agreement to acquire the business, Boston Neurovascular received a long-awaited FDA 510(k) clearance of its next-generation target coil, a key milestone; given coils represent roughly 50% of the $1 billion worldwide neurovascular market. This was followed in late December with 510(k) clearance of the next-generation coil detachment system that allows for coil detachment in less than 10 seconds, representing a demonstrable improvement over the prior system that required upwards of one minute to detach each coil. ", "Throughout our due diligence, we consistently heard from customers that the length of time required for coil detachment was the key competitive disadvantage for Neurovascular system, and as such, we're extremely excited about this launch. Although still early, we are highly encouraged by the customer feedback and believe these product introductions will help drive accelerating sales growth over time.", "Turning to elective procedure trends and implant pricing, at this point, it's fairly well-understood that the combination of the global economic contraction, continued rise in healthcare plan deductibles, the expiration of COBRA and unemployment benefits and the high unemployment rate resulted in a slowdown in elective procedures in 2010. Yet despite this perfect storm of adverse events, the joint replacement market still achieved year-over-year revenue and unit growth in every quarter of 2010, underscoring the strength of the market and the myriad benefits realized to patients who undergo hip and knee replacement. ", "And although a subset of patients have clearly deferred the procedure, we continue to expect those patients will eventually return to the surgery pool, given the high success rates of both hip and knee replacements and the lack of options for the treatment of osteoarthritis. When combined with the increasingly debilitating pain associated with OA and its pronounced impact on quality of life, the ability to permanently defer a hip or knee replacement is simply not a viable option for the vast majority of patients. Admittedly, it's not possible to predict in what quarter or even year patients who deferred surgery will represent, and so our financial forecast assumes a joint replacement market that's similar with respect to growth rates in 2011 as we saw in 2010.", "As it relates to pricing for our U.S. hip and knee implants, in Q4 we continued to see ongoing Recon pricing pressure partly offset by mix. We also continued to see an ability to garner both price and mix with innovative new products as evidenced by the price premiums we are realizing for ADM and Rejuvenate Hip Systems that were launched in early 2010 and have contributed to a strengthening of the mix contribution in Q4. Although U.S. hip and knee pricing trends remain challenging, at less than 20% of our total sales, combined with a partial offset afforded by mix, we view this as a very manageable headwind as we move into 2011. ", "Finally, I'll make a few comments on MedSurg market trends, particularly as it relates to hospital CapEx. Recall that approximately 52% of MedSurg sales, including Ascent, are from capital expenditures. In 2010, we experienced a modest and steady improvement in the MedSurg environment aided by our breadth of offering across the various MedSurg franchises, as well as the need for hospitals to resume certain capital purchases. ", "We also continue to see solid growth from our MedSurg service businesses, which includes Ascent as well as other services offerings. With respect to 2010 representing a catch-up year for hospital capital purchases, we do not believe this was a material factor behind our growth, which may also reflect the nature of our capital product offerings that tend to be relatively lower dollar investments. For 2011, we assumed continued steady growth in our MedSurg businesses, reflecting underlying organic growth, market share gains and the benefit from acquisitions. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. We're obviously pleased with our fourth quarter results and the full year performance, as they are indicative of both the growth potential and underlying earnings strength of the company. We exceeded our original expectations, while still addressing the challenge of a slowdown in elective procedures and price pressure in hips, knees and spine, while simultaneously making concentrated investments in R&D and M&A to position our company for continued top and bottom line growth. ", "Moving to the fourth quarter results, sales increased 8.8% on a reported basis and 8.6%, excluding currency. Acquisitions added 3.1% with the Ascent acquisition contributing 2% to our reported growth rate. For the full year, Ascent has contributed 2.2% to our 8.9% reported growth. On the earnings side, our revenue growth and solid gross margin allowed us to generate adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.93, an increase of 13.4% over Q4 of 2009. On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.74, a decrease of 2.6% versus Q4 of 2009. Our reported GAAP earnings included $123.5 million impairment charge associated with our decision to divest the Biotech Bone business, while 2009 included the credit associated with the favorable patent litigation outcome and costs associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings.", "Turning to some specifics in the quarter, I will begin with currency, which was effectively immaterial to top line sales. For the year, currency increased reported sales by approximately $70 million or 1%. As noted in our January 10 press release, currency in the first quarter of 2011 moves to a modest tailwind, and if rates hold near quarter-end levels, we would expect the first quarter sales impact to be approximately flat to up 1% when compared to 2010. Using quarter-end rates, the full-year currency impact on top line sales would be an increase in the range of 0.5% to 1.5% when compared to 2010. ", "Next, I'll discuss the impact of price and volume mix on the top line. In the quarter, company-wide selling prices declined 2.1% on a worldwide basis. For the full year, total company price was down 1.7%. The number of selling days in the fourth quarter was equal with 2009.", "Looking at the product segments, I'll start with Orthopaedic Implants, which represented 58% of our sales in the quarter and is comprised of our Hip, Knee, Trauma, Spine, CMF and other implant products. In the quarter, total Orthopaedic Implants delivered a 5% increase on a reported basis and were up 4% in constant currency. On a worldwide basis, Hips reported solid growth of 6% in dollars and 6% in constant currency. In the U.S. market, Hip sales were up 7%, indicative of the traction we're starting to gain with our ADM and Rejuvenate offering. And encouragingly, International Hip sales returned to positive territory, increasing 4% on a constant currency basis.", "Worldwide Knee sales increased 3% on both reported and constant currency basis. U.S. Knees reported 4% growth, while in the international market; Knees increased 2% on a constant currency basis. We continue to look for FDA clearance of the OtisMed customized cutting blocks during 2011. ", "Global Trauma segment recorded nice quarterly gains, increasing 8% in both dollars and on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. Trauma segment posted a strong 12% increase, delivering double-digit growth in three out of four quarters in 2010. For our International, Trauma sales were up 6% on a constant currency basis. ", "Our Global Spine segment continued to face challenges in the quarter consistent with the broader market, as evident by the 3% decline on both reported and constant currency basis. U.S. Spine sales were down 4% versus prior year, while in the international market, Spine sales were flat.", "In summary, total Orthopaedic Implants registered a nice quarter. Domestic results were largely driven by share gains associated with new products, while international gains were paced by strong growth in Japan and the emerging market countries of Korea, China and India. Encouragingly, our Europe business also continued to move towards recovery in total Orthopaedic Implants supported by strong Trauma segment growth and the anniversary of our Q3 2009 distribution and product obsolescence actions. ", "Finally, we are encouraged by the steady stream of new products that are launched in the international markets, including ADM, Rejuvenate and OtisMed, which are expected to positively impact 2011 results. ", "Next, I'll turn to the MedSurg Group, which represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. MedSurg today is comprised of our Instruments and Data Feeds [ph] Medical and Ascent Healthcare businesses. MedSurg reported another solid growth quarter with sales increasing 15%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis.", "In total, acquisitions added approximately 8% to MedSurg, while the core MedSurg business reported growth of 8%. Of note in the quarter, domestic MedSurg sales, excluding the acquisition impact, increased 9%, reflecting the strength of our underlying capital and disposable MedSurg product offering. ", "Sales for the Global Instruments segment again posted strong results growing 10% in the fourth quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis. In U.S. market, Instruments reported an impressive 11% gain, while internationally, Instrument sales also advanced nicely, recording a 9% gain in constant currency? ", "Our Endoscopy offering reported a global sales increased of 5% on both a reported and constant currency basis. In the U.S. market, Endoscopy sales recorded a modest 2% increase, while the domestic results were below recent quarterly trends. Overall, we feel good about the underlying performance and prospects for our domestic Endoscopy business given order trends. Internationally, Endoscopy sales continue to strengthen, delivering 11% constant currency gain.", "Finally, our Medical segment saw global sales improve to a strong 21% in the quarter on both a reported and constant currency basis. Excluding the acquisitions, Global Medical sales advanced 10%. U.S. Medical sales increased 31% and 17%, excluding the Gaymar acquisition, while our International Medical sales declined 12% in constant currency.", "Overall, our MedSurg businesses continued to achieve steadily improving growth in the underlying businesses, further aided by acquisitions that are broadening our product offering and importance to our customers. ", "I'll now turn to the remainder of the income statement, providing comments on both the fourth quarter and our expectations for 2011. I will begin with our gross margin performance. Gross margin was again strong in the quarter at 68.7%, representing 100-basis-point increase over fourth quarter 2009 levels. For the year, gross margin of 68.8% finished slightly above our expectations and was up 130 basis points over 2009, recognizing the comparison benefited from the depressed 2009 base and currency variations. Going forward, we do anticipate year-over-year gross margin improvement, partly resulting from our focus in our manufacturing operating model. ", "Research and development investments represented 5.6% of sales in the quarter, while increasing 24% over 2009 levels. For the year, R&D finished at 5.4% of sales and increased 17% over prior year. Our heightened level of R&D investment throughout 2010 reflects both our commitment to innovation, as well as the flexibility we retained in our business model to make investments that will drive long-term growth, while delivering leveraged earnings gains. Our commitment to increase R&D spending will remain in place as we enter into 2011, as we expect R&D investments to increase well above our sales growth rates and approach 6% of revenues. Clearly, the addition of the Neurovascular business is influencing in total spend, but even absent this addition, we see R&D in our core business increasing at double-digit rates. ", "Selling, general and administrative costs increased 17% over 2009 levels in the fourth quarter. Recall 2009 SG&A was favorably impacted by a $62.5 million patent litigation gain recorded last year. ", "Overall, excluding the prior-year impact of the gain in SG&A, expense growth in the quarter was 6% and SG&A decreased 90 basis points to 36.8% of sales versus 2009. For the year, adjusted SG&A decreased 90 basis points as a percentage of sales versus 2009 levels. In 2011, we expect to continue the trend of decreasing SG&A as a percentage of sales as we focus on operational efficiency, while reserving the flexibility to make strategic investments across our businesses. Operating income increased 13% on an adjusted basis. The operating margin finished the quarter at 25.6% and, for the year, increased a robust 150 basis points versus prior year to 25.3% of sales.", "Other income and expense reduced pretax income by $7 million in the quarter. Components of this included investment income of $12 million and FX transactional gains of $8 million, offset by interest expense of $27 million. The company's effective income tax rate was 22.2% for the fourth quarter of 2010. The fourth quarter tax rate reflects the tax benefit associated with the impairment of the OP-1 bone assets and the legislative action to approve the R&D tax credit and related corporations' look-through rule. Absent these items, the company's effective income tax rate was 27.7% in Q4. ", "For the full year of 2010, the company's adjusted effective tax rate was 27.3%, which does include the impact of the R&D tax credit and related look-through rule on our full year results. From a comparative, this allows alignment with both 2009 actual and 2011 expectations. For 2011, we see our tax rate moving lower as a result of increased production coming from lower tax jurisdictions and expect to rate between 26.5% and 27.3%.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the year with $4.38 billion of cash and marketable securities, up $1.43 billion from year end '09. Obviously, this balance has been reduced given the January 3 closing of the NV transaction and the associated $1.4 billion payment. That said, we think the remaining cash balance gives us tremendous flexibility. And as a reminder, we have $1 billion of debt on the balance sheet associated with our January 2010 debt offering.", "Asset management remains under solid control as accounts receivable days ended the year at 56 comparable with the prior year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at an improved 154, which was down 20 days sequentially versus third quarter, but up nine days against the prior year level. ", "Cash flow from operations was again strong in the quarter, generating $518 million and free cash flow of $573 million. For the year, cash flow from operations increased to $1.55 billion from $1.46 billion in 2009. On the share repurchase program, as announced in our pre-release, we repurchased 6.1 million shares at a cost of $314 million in the fourth quarter. This brings total 2010 share repurchases to 8.3 million shares at a cost of $426 million. We currently have approximately $325 million remaining on our 2009 authorization and $500 million from our 2010 authorization. ", "We referenced diluted shares outstanding in December finished at $394.8 million. As we have stated previously, you should assume that the goal of the authorization is to prevent dilution, as well as position the company to opportunistically acquire shares.", "In summary, 2010 was a solid year in which we demonstrated the ability of our diverse business to absorb market challenges, while still delivering on total company performance expectations. Further, we continue to deploy the resources of our balance sheet to enhance our core franchises, expand into the meaningful adjacencies and increase total shareholder return. Heading into 2011, we feel good about the strength of the company and our ability to continue to grow our revenue and earnings as reflected in our 2011 outlook. ", "Turning to our outlook, the financial forecast for 2011 includes a constant currency net sales increase of 11% to 13% as a result of growth in shipments of Orthopaedic Implants and MedSurg Equipment, as well as revenue from the recently acquired Neurovascular business. The foreign currency exchange rates we hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be favorably impacted by approximately 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year of 2011. Excluding the expected impact from foreign currency as well as acquisitions, sales growth from our core business is projected to be in the 5% to 7% range. ", "Turning to the P&L, I mentioned in my earlier comments our expectations for each of the key areas to include gross margin, R&D and tax. Additionally, we continued to invest in our quality and compliance initiatives, as we complete the initial three-year investment. We see ongoing opportunities for leverage in SG&A, as a percentage of sales, as we look to remain disciplined with respect to discretionary spending, while retaining the ability to make the necessary investments. ", "Finally, we expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2011 will be in the range of $3.65 to $3.73, an increase of 10% to 12% over adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $3.33 in 2010. We also anticipate acquisition and integration-related charges associated with the recently completed Neurovascular business to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.21 to $0.25, including transaction costs, additional costs associated with inventory step-up and other integration costs as outlined in our press release. ", "In closing, we are comfortable with first-call estimates for both the quarter and full year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks, Curt. In closing, we're pleased that we reestablished strong growth in 2010, while also making significant progress on our quality and compliance initiatives. We believe we are well-poised entering 2011 to both face the challenges that will invariably exist, while also continuing to capitalize on emerging opportunities. We look forward to executing on our financial goals and delivering strong results that will continue to define Stryker as a leading player in the medical technology market. With think that, we'll now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Steve, I wonder if you could talk a little bit on metal-on-metal implants and the impact you're seeing in the marketplace and specifically your business? And clearly, what some of your competitors are reporting, it's having an impact certainly on their hip franchises mostly on internationally but somewhat in the U.S. as well. I wonder if you see this as a share opportunity for Stryker in your business or sort of the elimination of a historical headwind? And if you are gaining share based on metal-on-metal, do you find opportunities to both gain Hip share and then obviously, levers that over to the Knee business as well?", "Stephen MacMillan", "It certainly really at minimum, it eliminates the headwind. As many of you know, we've lagged the hip market for five years running, largely because of our decision to stay out of metal-on-metal. We feel good about that decision now. We would certainly hope that it will create not just the loss of a headwind but also the opportunities to start the gain on some Hip market share and where possible, certainly, we will always seek to leverage that over to a very strong Knee franchise. So we'll certainly see how it plays out, but I think we really do like our position right now with some new product launches in the Hip space and given the market dynamics.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "And then Curt, just thinking about the comments you made about Neurovascular, making the acquisition, I think you guided or assuming in your wandering integration period, you'd see rather flattish growth for this year, but kind of considering early traction with some of the new products and the fact that the prior asset had not generated new product pipeline growth in quite some time, is that flat expectation for growth reflect some conservatism or just some contra sales synergies we should be thinking about to how with significant new products, we still kind of see kind of flattish outlook here for '11?", "Curt Hartman", "David, I think there's a couple of items in there that we would point to: one is the integration of an acquisition of this scale especially on a global basis; and two, would be the timing and the ability to ramp up production as well as the training and rollout of the new product. So we're very excited about the target coil approval. We're very excited about the detachment system approval. There is certainly a long, long pathway to product rollout on a global basis, as well as bringing an education of both the selling organization as well as the customer base and keeping in mind that roughly 2/3 of this business is OUS. You're going through many country registrations with the new products as well. So we're trying to factor in all of those various factors into our expectations for this year. And so, I think that's when we get to the neutral to slightly accretive on EPS as well as very muted expectations for top line growth this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "We've got some mixed signals early on here on the economy pricing utilization. I'd be curious to get your perspective. We heard from J&J today, it seems like a pretty somber message on utilization pushback on pricing pressure, et cetera. But your numbers again seemed to suggest that, at least, a little more optimistic, but your perspective generally?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Clearly, there's more pressures, but ultimately, we still love the businesses we're in. And I think as Katherine pointed out, for all of the perfect storm against the reconstructive implants last year, they still grew every quarter. Fundamentally, the demographics are on our side. We continue to believe that if we're offering good products and these procedures are not indefinitely deferrable, I think we still feel pretty good about the market dynamics, and most importantly, I'd say we feel really good about our position within the marketplace right now.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "And maybe turning to the international part of Hips and Knees, which did grow a little slower particularly on the Knee side, can you give us a little perspective on just maybe your feelings about the economic outlook and is that a concern for this year? And maybe extending that, I know you've been through some product transition and some distributor transitions. Are we through all that? And how do we think about that for 2011?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure, thanks, Rick. I think internationally, certainly, our Knee business had suffered particularly in Europe from the distributor changes we've made and also a lot of the products that we have obsoleted during the year, as well as frankly some slowness in rolling out instrumentation for our Scorpio Knee line, which was really a hangover from a lot of our quality and compliance initiatives. I think we feel better exiting the year and coming into 2011 than we did in 2010, and we'd probably hope for a modest pickup there. And having said that, I think Europe, with the overall market dynamics, may still be soft here for the first half of the year and maybe for the full year. But again, I think we feel great about how we're positioned and globally, probably, it would be a little bit better next year in 2011 rather than 2010.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "I wanted to follow up on a question on acquisitions. First, just in terms of the trends of Gaymar and Ascent, you've had Ascent here for coming up on a year and Gaymar for a quarter or so. As you think about trends for 2011, similar to your point on Neurovascular, what kind of consideration do we need to give to integration, this sort of new product registration? Are there sort of sideways growing with your market? Or is there a transition period where we might be kind of flat or down for a couple of quarters? Any color you could provide, then I have a follow-up.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure, Matt, I think we feel pretty good about our ability to integrate those and keep those growing, and particularly given product flow and everything else, and Gaymar coming right into our Medical business. That integration looks to be going fine. And Ascent is still on a very nice space. Obviously, a little bit of growing pains here and there, but overall, we continue to really like the outlook and trajectory for that business.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "And then just your comments on pricing, Steve, following up on Rick's question. I guess specifically on Spine, not that there's plenty of things to learn about in the Spine space but one of the things that came out of the meeting this morning with J&J, it was kind of like sequential easing of pricing pressure. It's pretty consistent pricing in Orthpedics, as you've talked about at Spine, maybe its comps; maybe the low-hanging fruit has been picked. But I'm curious to get your outlook on whether you think that's stable, that negative mid-single digits, which is what the industry seems to be talking about for a while before, actually, it may seem easing of that pressure over the next several quarters?", "Katherine Owen", "Maybe I'll jump in and take that. We don't break out price specifically by franchise, although we've alluded to in Q4. We're in similar in that. We've been seeing ongoing pricing pressure in the Spine business, similar to what the market is seeing. I think it's too early to say that we've turned the corner. We think there's a stabilization trend, how much pricing does or doesn't improve as we go into 2011, I think it's just probably too early to say. And a lot of that is going to be driven by new product introductions and innovations that come into the market. But overall, it's still a challenging market, but one that doesn't feel like it's worsening.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Christopher Pasquale - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "This is Chris Pasquale here for Mike. Just to follow up on the question about pricing. We've seen the impact on your business overall increase pretty steadily for the past six quarters or so. What does your initial 2011 revenue guidance assume for a pricing headwind for the year?", "Curt Hartman", "It's an interesting question because it is basically an assumption and it's probably consistent with what we saw this year. We don't, right now, see any things that would point us to worsening pricing trends in Hips and Knees. Katherine's already commented on Spine. And overall, on a global basis, we feel pretty good about what we're seeing in the rest of our business. Again, keeping in mind that most of the focus on pricing in these discussions have been around Hips, Knees and Spine, and Stryker's portfolio of business allows us to absorb a lot of that through other opportunities for innovation and the other products we offer. So I would say our assumptions should be modeled similar to what you saw through the course of this year.", "Christopher Pasquale - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then you signaled coming into 2010 that you expected to be active on the M&A front and it did end up being a pretty busy year for the company. As you look at 2011, you talked about some of the integration efforts you have to do with the deals you've already done. Are you still in a position to be aggressive looking at opportunities? Or do you have your hands full with the deals you did over the past few months? And if deals aren't the first call in cash, did that change how you think about the speed of share buybacks?", "Katherine Owen", "We've really continued to reiterate a very consistent strategy, as it relates to our utilization of cash, and it is being three-pronged. We think, given our pretty significant ability to generate cash, it really does give us the flexibility to employ a three-pronged strategy. It's going to include M&A. It's going to include buybacks and dividends, which you saw another healthy year-over-year increase in dividend. There's no change to that strategy. We're fairly large in terms of the number of franchises. So, for example, the integration of Gaymar into Medical really has no impact on anything outside of that division. So the nature of BD, it's impossible to predict how much volume comes through, but there's been no change to their overall strategy. We still think there's a lot of opportunities to leverage our core with Gaymar, Porex, SONOPET, being examples of that, as well as opportunistically look at adjacent acquisition strategies like Neurovascular. And there's no change to that overall guiding principle.", "Curt Hartman", "And Chris, I would just pile on here and remind you, I think we feel really good about the underlying strength of our business, which allows us to be disciplined acquirers, and we want to continue to pride ourselves on being very disciplined acquirers. And I think the ability to have a strong base business puts us in that position, and we expect to continue to do the same.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vivian Cervantes with Maxim Group.", "Vivian Cervantes - Maxim Group LLC", "I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the new Hip products that are being rolled out. Given the performance in the U.S., can you just give us a sense for where we are with the launch? I think at one point we thought this could be a two-year process? Is it still a two-year process or did we accelerate, given the weak macro?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We've always described ourselves with Recon launches, being a little bit of a freight train, Vivian. It takes us a little, while to get going, and I think that's exactly what we're seeing. I do think we were starting to accelerate our trend in the final quarter of the year and feel pretty good about where it should go this year. But I don't think -- we're not fully ramped up yet but certainly on track.", "Vivian Cervantes - Maxim Group LLC", "And just another follow-up, also on the Neurovascular business and the new coil and detachable that was recently approved. Can we sort of say that maybe these two approvals will protect current market share primarily? And how does that compare with competing products out there from a market share gain standpoint?", "Curt Hartman", "I think there's a couple of answers to that question. Number one, the organization has been waiting for these new products. So it's a great confidence-builder in the organization. The customer base who's been using the Neurovascular products for many years is thrilled to see this organization bringing them new solutions on the innovative front. So our expectation is it will both stabilize any market share erosion that may have occurred over the last couple of years. I think when we went back and did the math in the last five years, there were approximately 20 new products launched into that space, while this business had none. So the competitive attack in the last five years has been significant. So the ability to give this organization a new product, address customer issues, stabilize their customer base. And then ideally, as we continue to roll out a pipeline of other items throughout the year and into the following years, get the organization back on offense would be the expectation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "So the negative 2.1% price mix that you talked about this quarter, that, I think it's a little bit worse than what you're talking about in the third quarter. And I know you're saying for 2011 that you think that it will be about the same as what you saw in 2010. So, I'm just wondering if you could help us try to give some confidence in your statements that things won't get worse in 2011 from a price mix perspective? I'm just curious what are the kinds of things you're seeing out in the marketplace that give you that confidence at this point?", "Katherine Owen", "I think, first of all, that negative 2% price, that's pure price. So there's going to be an offset as we've been seeing throughout the year, an offset to that comes from mix. But when we're reporting price, we're talking about just the pure price impact. And overall, in terms of the outlook for 2011, a lot of it comes from the cadence of new products that we expect to be launching, the mix benefit that we are seeing to help offset that and just overall trends we're seeing with respect to the market that don't indicate a significant worsening in the overall pricing trends. It's going to bounce around from quarter-to-quarter, as we saw in 2011. But overall, we don't think you're going to see a demonstrable step-down.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "So just to be clear, within that 5% to 7% top line growth, there's an assumption that price mix combined is down 1% to 2%? I just wanted to make sure we've got it.", "Curt Hartman", "That's price, Bob.", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Just price, so that's not net of mix. And then I wanted to ask a question about gross margin. Are you assuming some gross margin benefit in 2011? And then you've talked previously about how you've undergone, obviously, this quality of journey over the last two and a half years. And now you've put the head of the quality initiatives also in charge of manufacturing. And you've implied that on this call, you see some longer-term gross margin benefits to come from that. I'm wondering why those are so long term, as you've kind of been on the quality mission for two and a half years. Shouldn't we see more of that in 2011? And just if you wouldn't mind talking about gross margin, that will be helpful.", "Curt Hartman", "Sure, Bob. In my comments, in the scripted section on gross margin where that we did see opportunities for improvement in 2011. I want to be measured in that comment, because some of the pick-up you saw this past year in 2010 was directly attributable to some pretty wild swings in currency, especially when you look at our distribution model and where our manufacturing occurs. To the point of shouldn't the results be sooner rather than later. I think one of your statements hit the nail right on the head. The last two years, two-plus years, had been 100% focus on the quality initiatives. That journey continues on the plan that it's on through at least the first half of this year, and we'll constantly be working on enhancing quality systems. The same individual who's responsible for that, as you noted, is also responsible for our global manufacturing network. And as somebody who's watched Stryker for a long time, you know we have a pretty diverse geographic manufacturing footprint. So corralling all of those processes and focusing on the biggest priorities takes a bit of time, and those are the things that we're working through right now. I would tell you over the long term, I couldn't be more excited about the opportunity, but it does take time. And in a highly compliant environment, we cannot afford to rush and make mistakes because any mistake would simply move us back well, well back into a quality journey that we feel like we're making forward progress on. So we're going to be very measured in our approach here and be very disciplined in our approach here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "In order to make these numbers work by my calculations, you're looking at sort of gross margins flattish and a step-up in SG&A. I would assume some of that is acquisition integration waiting for you guys to do your own quality control and put your management magic on your acquisitions. Having said all of that, how much can you get back to the wonderful leverage we saw in 2010 as we look into 2012?", "Curt Hartman", "We just put out 2011 guidance. I'm probably not going to jump into 2012 just yet. But obviously, when you do an acquisition, especially an acquisition that has the scale of the Neurovascular one, you're going to see the top line benefit, and you're actually going to see the deleveraging in the P&L. Clearly, one of the goals is to work through the integration and get back into leveraging that additional revenue. And you should assume that our goal is to do that as quickly as reasonably possible, while still sticking with the overall design of where we're going with the Neurovascular business along with our other core franchises. So, I'm not going to give any specifics in 2012, but obviously, that is one of the benefits, frankly, of doing the acquisitions, as you get to the top line acceleration and you have to organize around the P&L leverage in the future periods.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just as a follow-up then, should we assume then as we go throughout the year that leverage is going to become more and more obvious?  A simple question but I'm also asking on the gains to the quarters?", "Curt Hartman", "It's a simple question, but things, if we know anything about the business; they don't tend to run very linear quarter-over-quarter. They tend to move around quarter-over-quarter. So I would hope that a year from now, you could look back and see our progress. I'm not going to point that each successive quarter is going to materially get better. Certainly, on the integration side, you would expect a lot of those charges to be earlier in the year as we work through some of the big items, but they all take time. And there's always other investments that seem to somehow materialize.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is Matt [ph] for Adam. Two questions. So one is where everybody's been focused. I just want to make sure I'm hearing your message correctly. So in the Hips and Knees this quarter, there was some improvement, but I guess what you're saying is really the market's not improving much, but Stryker's doing a little better. It's a combination of product launches, lapping some issues and maybe some competitive disruptions. Is that sort of a fair characterization?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I think that's a fair comment, recognizing we haven't seen everybody report yet. But that's probably the way it looks right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then one area where people haven't really focused on this call is Trauma, where you had pretty good results, and that strung together a few good quarters there. I'm just wondering what your expectations are for your business and for the market going forward? That's something that we haven't talked about in a while.", "Katherine Owen", "We don't give guidance by individual franchise. We are pleased with how our Trauma business is doing. Part of that are moves that we did, going back a number of years, when we do have a hybrid sales model. And we think that allows us to execute adding products into the bag. So we've got great sales force focused at expanding products offering. Overall, those markets continue to be well. They do move around. If you look at the overall, over the years, quarterly trends that can be impacted by economic fluctuations or weather, et cetera, but overall, we feel good about that business. It's an upper single-digit growth market, we believe, and we feel well-positioned to continue to deliver good results in 2011.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Navarro of RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "A question on Spine. It looks like this was a quarter where you've lost market share in Spine. And I recall a year ago at this time, we were highlighting the new cervical plate as a way for Stryker to kind of recapture share and start growing the business aggressively again. So as we look out to 2011, understanding the market is under pressure, what is the strategy for Stryker to recapture its share and get back to market growth or better than market growth? That's question one. And then I also remember last year being at AAOS, and you're highlighting your kyphoplasty balloon. Any update on that product as well?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure, on the Spine market, I would tell you, I think we, for a number of years, have been very good at rolling out innovations and sales force expansion. The dynamics of the Spine market last year we probably slowed down our sales expansion. And while we have the cervical plate, we didn't have enough other things to really keep the franchise going. And I think we've been retooling some of the R&D efforts there to get back to a little bit better cadence of product flow. In terms of the iVAS balloon that we launched, it's off to a nice start, a steady start. And again, we point that out as one of those things. We have launched a lot of singles every year, not doubles and triples and home runs that two, three, four or five years out become meaningful businesses. This one is another one of those where nothing meaningful right now, but we like the trajectory.", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "So just one follow-up, Steve, on Spine. So, can you give us a sense of what are the products that may help you reenergize this business? Or should we just be assuming that your Spine franchise grows below market growth in 2011?", "Katherine Owen", "We haven't gone into details on new products. As you know, we don't... highlight some of the key products that we're introducing at the upcoming academy meeting across major businesses, as well as our flowing that out at our analyst meeting. I think right now we're pretty tempered regarding growth prospects expectations, both for the market and candidly for our Spine business, and as we look to improve the trends we saw in 2010.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "My first question relates to, I guess, really the diversity of your business. As you've noted recently in public presentations, you've been diversifying for the better part of, I think, three decades at this point. But clearly, your M&A activity's picked up over the last year or so. So, I guess what I'm wondering is what opportunities exists for you to drive growth by picking up shares specific to a broader product offering in the aggregate? And would you expect this to pick up momentum, given recent activity as well as I guess the need for the global healthcare system to control costs?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Doug, I think we feel really good about our position in every market we're in, in terms of being in sufficient scale to compete very well, and that's where we just looked for the little tuck-in acquisitions here and there, but we feel very well poised. And we always said during the '08, '09 time period, we thought there would be buying opportunities from the economic downturn and that we have positioned ourselves to capitalize on them. Right now, we've got a great set of businesses, all of which are of meaningful scale to compete and certainly don't need anything in terms of getting bigger.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "But I guess the crux of the question is, really, is there a very concerted effort to maybe get broader take to go after this? I know fumbling's not the right word or the word that we want to use, but is there the ability to actually broaden the portfolio and actually gain share that way by being a sole-source supplier?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We still believe more deeply in just going deeply within each product line and then looking for the leverage opportunities across. So, we're not going to diversify for diversification's sake. We're diversifying as we've done for three decades, as we see new business opportunities that are close into our core to keep expanding out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I wanted to ask one question on patient mix and then a follow-up on strategic direction. In at least our conversations in orthopedic surgeons, what we've heard is that generally speaking, they have not seen a tremendous slowdown in operating activity but over the course of the year. We saw the Medicare patient population make up a greater percentage of their patient volumes, which to some extent may explain some of the negative mix or dollars slowdown that we've seen in the industry. I was hoping to get your perspective on that and where we sort of are in Medicare, non-Medicare in the Hip and Knee market and whether you think that, at all, has had an impact on reported dollar growth in 2010?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, I think there's been some element of that, David, certainly with people unemployed and younger people not having as much insurance. Again, given the breadth of our portfolio, not making a huge difference probably.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then in terms of M&A, one thing that you've talked about in the past is that given the quality initiatives you've undertaken, that part of the evaluation of a target will be either to what extent they are at the same level of quality systems that you are or the costs associated with bringing them up to par. Can you just maybe highlight how that impacts the due diligence process of potentially the pacing at which you do transactions?", "Katherine Owen", "I think this is reflective of another one of the key focus areas in the due diligence process. We've obviously learned a tremendous amount to our own quality efforts and applying those learnings to acquisitions that it just adds to the list of areas that we focused on.", "Curt Hartman", "I will tell you the Boston Scientific business, they had made tremendous progress, and I would bet that we valued where their new quality systems are, perhaps, more than other people, because they have done a great job. And we feel great about that one.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Just curious on the Hip side of the market, given your good performance in the quarter compared to some of your competitors. Any sense for how much of that was more shares shipped within a specific surgeon base, be it that they shifted from their metal-on-metal product over the your metal on product versus new shares that you're taking in terms of new accounts?", "Katherine Owen", "I think it's too early to really have that level of granularity. It's just one quarter, and its one quarter where everybody hasn't reported yet. So, I think we're clearly seeing a lit bit of movement in metal-on-metal, but I don't think we can get that granular at this point.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "So you don't see it kind of from AAOS of last year through this point?", "Katherine Owen", "Not beyond what we've seen in the market where there's clearly been some contraction, how significant it's been, it's still relatively early. Surgeons tend to move pretty slowly one way or the other.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "On R&D, a pretty significant increase in spending 2010 and expected in 2011. Is that really focused on more clinical studies or post-market studies in support of your current products or upcoming products versus new product development?", "Curt Hartman", "I would tell you it's mostly new product development. The range of products we offer cover all classes of approval, and to the extent that there are heavier clinicals required, we have experienced with that across our product offering. This is really an initiative to ramp up more effort on pure new product innovation and, particularly, as it relates to coming out of the remediation efforts where a lot of remediation has started with R&D in getting our R&D organizations around the world focused on pure new product initiatives.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "First, just a clarification on capital. I just want to make sure I heard you right with, you said with U.S. Recon prices down, but it was almost offset by mix. So net-net, price mix is still negative in the quarter?", "Katherine Owen", "Partly offset by mix, net-net, still negative. It's very similar to the trend we saw throughout the year with a little bit of the strengthening of mix in the fourth quarter.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Going back to the pricing as we see the decline about 1% in the first quarter to 2.1% now. Would you guys say that, that trends in price getting more negative is more of a reflection of the overall orthopedic trends? Or are there any worsening in price within MedSurg? And then my second question is can you give a little bit more granularity on the $0.21 to $0.25 related to the Boston Scientific spend? And is there amortization included within there? Or is that included within your adjusted guidance? Just kind of what does that $0.21 to $0.25 make up?", "Curt Hartman", "So the first question there was pricing, and just a reminder, Q1 pricing was negative one-point ", "[Audio Gap]", "1.3 and then we to negative 1.5 then 1.8 then 2.1. So we have 80-basis-point movement over the course of the year. It's not anything that's going to require his to radically change our offense, especially when you look at the scale of new product rollouts, both in the U.S. and international markets. So nothing dramatically different outside of what we would refer to as normal pricing pressure, especially if you look back over the company's reported price change over the five-year period when we positionally bounced between plus two to minus two. But I don't think we see anything in the pricing that's dramatically challenging outside of a few key segments, which we've highlighted as Spine, being what we felt was the biggest pricing pressure area. And that goes back to Q4 of '09 when we made that comment. On the NV acquisition, those charges that we've called out in our press release are specific integration-related costs. There's a big inventory step-up charge that materializes over time, and there are other integration-related costs that could be in the form of outside services provided to the deal or just other onetime costs associated with transition of that business from one parent to the other.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "You mentioned OtisMed is kind of a work in progress. I'm curious if there's been any updates you could provide with what's happening with the FDA? And if nothing there, then perhaps any updates on your expectations for what that product could do to the Knee business?", "Katherine Owen", "No change in expectations. Clearly, we would have been hoping for 2010. As many of you know, it's predicting FDA timelines. And it has become more challenging. So we're hopeful for 2011, we still believe this is going to be a nice product. For our Knee growth, we were seeing the benefit of that prior to the acquisition at sometime in 2011, but nothing more specific than that is the current goal.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So, you're not even narrowing down the first half, second half or anything at this point?", "Katherine Owen", "No, not at this point.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "On the Ascent deal, a lot of moving parts on the MedSurg side in the fourth quarter, but if we -- our numbers, and I'm not saying they're correct, but it looks like Ascent may have been flat to slightly down from the third quarter on a dollar basis. Is that correct?", "Curt Hartman", "I don't think you would assume that we're going to break out our business to the size of Ascent on a dollar basis. I think you have to recognize it across MedSurg. Things, as I mentioned earlier, don't always flow evenly one quarter over the next, and I would point you back to Steve's comments that, overall, we feel pretty good about where Ascent stands after the first year. And as we head into 2011, we still have growth expectations for that franchise.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dave Turkaly with SIG.", "David Turkaly - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP", "I seem to remember some litigation that went on between Trident and Microsys [ph], part of J&J. I'm just curious on that detachment system in the new coil, are you comfortable with the intellectual properties that stands today?", "Curt Hartman", "We're very comfortable with the intellectual property, and obviously, the amount of due diligence around intellectual property was substantial. So I would say that we feel very good. I can't predict the future as it relates to legal. So I never say never as it comes to legal event in today's society, but our due diligence, we feel, is very comprehensive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "Maybe if you could give us a little bit more detail and color on what you're seeing in MedSurg? You've been sort of a full year now in terms of recovery from the major impact from the economic downturn. And I'm just wondering, as you look at sort of hospital CapEx spending trends and habits of now versus pre-recession, are you seeing any major changes in terms of the way that the hospitals are approaching their CapEx spending that would lead you to believe that there would be sort of moving forward, a fundamental shift in the way that you view the business?", "Curt Hartman", "Derrick, I don't think there's any fundamental shift of how we view the business. I think if there is a change in MedSurg capital spend behavior, it's at the approval levels. It used to probably be a little more close to the action. It probably moved up higher in the organization, perhaps to the C-suite. And in some cases, that has been relinquished back down to high-level materials management or purchasing folks. And in other cases, continues to reside of the C-suite, and if there is a change in behavior, it's probably our selling organizations have had to learn how to sell on a broader basis, as it relates to capital equipment in the hospitals.", "Derrick Sung - Bernstein Research", "And specifically, this quarter in Endoscopy, I know you kind of talked about lumpy quarters, but what specifically drove the weakness there? Was it share loss in your view or just some big accounts for sales that didn't go through or can you kind of give any deep color there?", "Stephen MacMillan", "It's timing. Don't worry about it. It's just timing. It will be fine. We're not going to lose any share.", "Curt Hartman", "Similar to what we saw in Medical earlier in one of the quarters. I feel very good about those businesses.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]  Our next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Wachovia", "Given your decision to sell the OP-1 business, I was just wondering if you could provide us with an update on your overall strategy in the Biologics area and whether or not you would rule out developing or acquiring any other higher-end biologic products in the future?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think, Mike, we're not going to get into strategic direction on this call. We'll probably lay some a little bit more of that of at our analyst meeting later in the year. But I think you can suffice to say, we're looking, still, in the biologic area, and we'll talk about kind of where we're headed.", "Katherine Owen", "As we commented on the press release, we are still investing in OP-1 outside of the orthopedic bone application.", "Michael Matson", "And then just on MedSurg, can you give us an update on where you're at, driving that business into the international markets and how big of a driver that could really be for MedSurg overall?", "Stephen MacMillan", "It continues to be good. Previous to the last question, I think our International Endo business was up 11% in the quarter. As Curt said, our International Instruments business was up 9%. We continue to feel very good about the trends and opportunities there.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.", "Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "I was just wondering, just given the uncertainty around OtisMed and the strong product lineup on the Hip side, how are you keeping the sales force focused on the Knee side of the business in 2011, where are we with Triathlon and what should we be focused on, relative to product flow in Knees outside of OtisMed in '11?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We still feel great about Triathlon and its longevity. There was a recent registry data out of the U.K. that shows Triathlon has, by far, the lowest revision rate. And for everything, if people talk about evidence-based medicine and registries and everything else, we feel great about the data that's being generated there that I think will give a little shot in the arm even to our organization. So we'll obviously be continuing to look at little line extensions here and there and other things to keep that business fresh.", "Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just on the Neurovascular business, obviously, you pointed to the two new products. Is there anything from a sales force perspective that needs to get invested in as well as in terms of getting that in order to get that growth up toward market level over the next 12 to 24 months?", "Curt Hartman", "I think, just like any of our other businesses, there are opportunities for sales force expansion in various markets. I'm not going to get real granular there, but as we get into the process of moving the business in the Stryker and all geographies, we'll obviously looking very deeply at what they have or what they don't have, where their presence is adequate and where there may be opportunities to enhance their presence. And we'll get into that as we further ingrain the business and get through some of the basic, what I would call month-one operational issues.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our Q&A session. I'll turn it over to you, sir, for closing remarks.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Great, thank you, Melanie, and thank you, everybody, for your time tonight. I know it's gone a little long here with a lot of questions. We continue to feel really good about our team and the results we're generating, and our conference call for our first quarter 2011 operating results will be held on April 19, 2011.

My name is Jonathan, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions]  Now certain statements made in today's conference call may contain information that includes or is based on forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law that are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.", "Such factors include, but are not limited to, weakening of economic conditions that could adversely affect the level of demand for the company's products; pricing pressures, generally, including cost containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the company's products; changes in foreign exchange market; legislative and regulatory actions; unanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and otherwise that affect U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of new products; changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payers; a significant increase in product liability claims; unfavorable resolution of tax audits; changes in financial markets, changes in the competitive environment; and the company's ability to integrate acquisitions.", "Additionally, information concerning these factors are contained in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "At this time, I would like to hand the call off to Mr. Stephen MacMillan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you, Jonathan, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's first quarter 2011 earnings report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "Consistent with prior calls, I will make some summary comments regarding our quarterly results before passing the call over to Katherine and Curt to provide more specifics. As most of you have seen by now, we have provided a reclassification of our revenue in order to better convey the major sales drivers, including MedSurg, Reconstructive and Neurotechnology and Spine. This was prompted in part by our recent Neurovascular acquisition, which broadened our existing presence in the neurosurgery space. With the reclassification, you can now see the totality of our Neurotechnology sales, which includes both Neurovascular and Neurosurgery revenue and topped $178 million in Q1 on top of $320 million of annual sales in 2010.", "And for the total company, sales exceeded $2 billion in the quarter for the first time ever. Our Q1 results reinforced many of the key themes that we expressed at the start of the year, including: one, the strength of our balanced diversified revenue model; two, the leverage provided by our capital allocation strategy, which includes acquisitions, buybacks and dividends; three, our commitment to driving internal innovation as evidenced by the strong 23% increase in R&D on top of a 17% increase for full year 2010.; four, against all of this, there remains our continued focus on driving quality first through our ongoing investments in quality and compliance.", "As many of you on the call are aware, we are highly committed to the business model that had fueled our company's growth from the start, which is leveraging our core offering and expanding into select adjacent markets. This has resulted in a balanced portfolio, expanding number of important segments in medical technology, and it's the diversity of this portfolio that allows for a consistency in our financial results, both top and bottom, even though certain portions of our business are inevitably more or less challenged in any given quarter. Q1 was no exception with relative softness in our Reconstructive business, more than offset by the strength across our key MedSurg franchises. Additionally, Stryker Neurovascular is off to a strong start in its first quarter as part of our company, with the team reversing multiyear trends of sales declines and delivering positive year-over-year revenue growth in the United States.", "Our first quarter results also continue to build on our strategy of optimizing our capital allocation, which includes the benefit of a series of acquisitions we've completed over the last 12-plus months, including the MEDPOR assets of Porex Surgical, Gaymar Industries and as mentioned, Neurovascular. All three businesses are in line or above our initial expectations and reinforce our commitment to focusing our acquisition activities on enhancing our core franchises and expanding into key adjacent markets.", "Beyond acquisitions, our multi-pronged cash strategy also includes continued buybacks in the first quarter. And as a reminder in our ongoing efforts to maximize shareholder return, our most recent dividend represented a 20% year-over-year increase. The strength of our balance sheet and continued robust cash generation allows us to pursue a multi-pronged approach to capital allocation, while also making the critical investments in our business that will drive innovation.", "We started the year with the expectation we would deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.65 to $3.73 per share, an increase to 10% to 13%. With Q1 adjusted EPS of 12.5% to $0.90, we remain confident in our outlook for both sales and earnings in 2011.", "In summary, we view our Q1 results as compelling evidence of the benefits afforded by our unique sales footprint, bolstered by a strong balance sheet that provides us with the flexibility that further augment both sales and earnings growth.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Steve. My comments today will focus on acquisitions, as well as elected procedure trends and implant pricing. As Steve mentioned in his comments, we are pleased with the performance for Stryker Neurovascular in the first quarter as part of our company. And although we don't typically provide quarterly updates regarding specific acquisitions, given the relatively larger size of this deal, we thought we'd offer some additional context. Recall that just prior to announcement of the definitive agreement to acquire the business, Neurovascular received a long-awaited FDA 510(k) clearance of its next generation Target coil, a key milestone given coils represent roughly 50% of the billion-dollar worldwide Neurovascular market. This was followed in late December with 510(k) clearance of the next generation coil detachment system that allows the coil detachment in less than 10 seconds, which is the demonstrable improvement of the prior system that required upwards of one minute to detach the coil. Throughout our due diligence, we consistently heard from customers that the length of time required for coil detachment was the key competitive disadvantage for the Neurovascular system, and we believe that's been addressed with these launches, which helped drive positive growth in the U.S. sales in Q1.", "In addition to the positive trends in the Neurovascular business, we are also pleased with the early performance for both Gaymar Industries within our Medical franchise and the MEDPOR assets of Porex Surgical, which is part of our CMF division. Both acquisitions are examples of transactions focused on strengthening our core product offering, and the teams are off to a solid start integrating these businesses.", "With respect to elective procedures and implant pricing, many of the trends that developed during 2010 still remained headwinds at this point in 2011. Although the market improved modestly in Q4, as we noted in last quarter's call, we did not view the results as indicative of a major rebound. Rather, we were and remain cautious regarding the hip and knee market pending evidence of a sustained improvement in the economic environment. We are highly encouraged by the acceptance in the market of our latest Hip offering, ADM, and MDM, which position us well in the large bearing head segment of the reconstructive hip market and similar to Q4 are driving a favorable mix benefit that's partly offsetting the continued negative Reconstructive pricing trend.", "There are no noteworthy developments with respect to Reconstructive pricing from what we've seen for a number of quarters. Overall, we believe procedure volumes in the hip and knee market are largely stable, recognizing that the myriad macro issues are dampening elective procedures. Given the degenerative nature of osteoarthritis and the progressively debilitating pain that result, we firmly believe that patients currently deferring hip and knee replacement will represent at some point. In the interim, although the Recon market growth is below historic norms, the collective strength of our broad-based product offering is driving total sales growth consistent with our expectations at the start of the year.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. I'll start my comments by first pointing to our press release and highlighting the information in our supplemental sales reporting. We have made some notable changes to include new reporting segments, as well as the addition of selected segment revenue disclosures. We believe this reporting will aid investors in further understanding the reach of the Stryker business and the range of our products and services offering.", "Looking at the first quarter, total company sales increased 12% on a reported basis and 10.2% on a constant currency basis. Strong, core MedSurg product growth, coupled with the acquisitions principally reflected in our new Neurotechnology segment, paced our growth. On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.78, a decrease of 2.5% versus Q1 of 2010. We have noted the Neurovascular inventory step-up, other acquisition and integration-related charges totaling $46 million net of tax as a non-GAAP adjusting item in our earnings release. Excluding the charge, increases are reported U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.78 to $0.90 per share. The U.S. GAAP diluted net earnings per share declined up 3% then becomes growth of 13% when excluding the identified non-GAAP items.", "In addition to revenue and earnings performance, additional highlights include steady cash generation and the repurchase of 4 million shares totaling $250 million during the quarter. Finally, the integration activities for the MEDPOR, Gaymar and Neurovascular acquisitions remain largely on track through the first quarter.", "In reviewing the quarter in more detail, I will start with a discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the first quarter, volume and mix contributed 6% to the top line. Acquisitions added 6%, and currency contributed to an increase in top line sales by approximately $32 million and improved the company's overall reported sales growth by 2%. Finally, company-wide selling prices declined 2% on a worldwide basis. The number of selling days was effectively equal with 2010 in most markets.", "Looking at our reporting segments, I will start with Reconstructive products, which represented 45% of our sales in the quarter. Reconstructive products include our Hip, Knee, Trauma and other Reconstructive lines. Our CMF and Spine results are not included in the Reconstructive segment. Reconstructive products increased 2% as reported and were flat on a constant currency basis. Knee results were especially challenged, driven in part by a softer market and our lack of a shape matching offering. Our Hip line was slightly better, both in the U.S. and international markets, and we remain encouraged by our offering and the early feedback from the roll-out of the MDM product. Trauma posted solid U.S. gains against slight declines in the international markets.", "Next I will turn to the MedSurg product segment, which represented 38% of sales in the quarter. For reporting purposes, MedSurg today is comprised of Instruments, Endoscopy, Medical and the Ascent Healthcare business. The NSC and Interventional Spine offerings are no longer reported in the Instrument segment under MedSurg. In total, MedSurg sales increased a strong 13% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. Acquisition added 2.3% to the reported increase. For consistency, if we back out the one-time Medical conversion sale we reported in the first quarter of 2010, MedSurg growth would've been a strong 14.7% on a constant currency basis.", "Additional highlights in the quarter include both our Endoscopy and Instrument segments, recording double-digit U.S. and international growth, and the Medical segment having a very solid U.S. performance supplemented by the Gaymar offering. Overall, the results of MedSurg reflected continued strengthening of our core product offering, which we have further augmented through selected acquisitions.", "Finally, I'll introduce our Neurotechnology and Spine product segment, which represented 17% of company sales in the quarter. For reporting purposes, the Neurotechnology business is comprised of our CMF business, previously reported under our Orthopaedic Implants segment, the NSC business previously reported under our Instrument segment and our newly acquired Neurovascular business. The Spine segment is made up of our Spinal Implant business previously reported under Orthopaedic Implants, as well as our Interventional Spine business previously reported under the instrument segment. We would note that the revamped reporting is intended to provide investors with better granularity regarding the scope of our product offering in these segments.", "In the quarter, the Neurotechnology and Spine product sales increased 48% as reported and 46% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for acquisitions and currency, Neurotechnology and Spine sales recorded a 4% increase. Highlights in the quarter include exceptionally strong organic growth from our Interventional Spine and NSC offerings, as well as the positive influence of the MEDPOR and Neurovascular acquisitions. Conversely, Spine implant sales remain challenged both from a volume and price standpoint.", "Regarding the Neurovascular business, we are pleased with the first quarter results and are proud to report that this business delivered strong performance in the U.S. market, which has been the focus for the new Target coil launch. Additionally, results in key international markets are trending in a favorable direction.", "Finally, we continue to communicate and work closely with our new customer base and, in general, are finding a welcome reception to the Stryker acquisition of this important and innovative business.", "I'll now turn to the income statement beginning with our gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins declined 190 basis points to 65.8% as a result of the Neurovascular acquisition inventory step-up. Excluding these charge, margins remain steady at 68.5% in the first quarter, inching down 20 basis points from fourth quarter levels, while exceeding prior year by 80 basis points. Also recall that in the first quarter of 2010, gross margins were suppressed by 30 basis points for the Ascent acquisition inventory step-up charge. Overall, the adjusted margins is a solid starting point for 2011 and is within our expected range.", "Research and development continued as an area of investment priority moving to 5.5% of sales, which is consistent with our investment level in the second half of 2010. Absent the influence of the Neurovascular business, total company R&D spend still increased at double-digit levels.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 38% of sales. Adjusting for acquisition and integration-related charges for the Neurovascular acquisition, SG&A finished at 37.3% of sales. This is in line with our prior year levels. We remain comfortable with the fluctuations in these categories as priorities materialize.", "Reported operating income decreased 5% over prior year and moved to 21% of sales, reflecting the impact of the Neurovascular inventory step-up and acquisition and integration-related charges. Adjusted operating income increased 10%, while the adjusted operating margin decreased 50 basis points versus prior year to 24.3% of sales. Other income and expense reduced pretax income by $12 million in the quarter. Components of this included investment income of $7 million, offset by an FX transactional loss of $1 million and interest expense of $17 million. The company's effective income tax rate was 25.4% for the first quarter of 2011. Excluding the tax benefit associated with the Neurovascular acquisition-related charges, our effective income tax rate would've been 26.2% for the first quarter. Of note, our tax rate reflects a tax credit to offset the Puerto Rico excise tax recorded in SG&A. This credit effectively decreased our rate by 50 basis points and will be recorded similarly in future periods.", "As a result, we are updating our 2011 tax rate expectations to a range of 26.0% to 26.8% from the previous range of 26.5% to 27.3%, again keeping in mind the offsetting cost for this adjustment is recorded in SG&A. In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.9 billion of cash and marketable securities, down $1.5 billion from year-end 2010. Obviously, this balance has been reduced given the January 3 closing of the NV transaction and the associated $1.45 billion payment. As a reminder, we have $1 billion of debt on the balance sheet associated with our January 2010 debt offering.", "On the asset management side, account receivable days ended the quarter at 59, which represented an increase of three days compared to the prior year and fourth quarter, well within our normal range. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 161, which was up seven days sequentially versus year end and 10 days against the prior year level. The impact of the Neurovascular acquisition and related inventory step-up impacting the P&L netted a higher dollar amount running through the cost of goods, an impact of the DII calculation by reducing days in inventory by 5 days.", "On cash flow, we continued to perform well, with cash flow from operations of $205 million and free cash flow of $150 million. Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total spend of $250 million. We currently have open authorizations totaling approximately $575 million.", "In summary, the first quarter was a solid start though we still have plenty of opportunity for improvement along with our ongoing integration efforts in the quarters ahead.", "Turning to our outlook, our guidance as Steve noted, remains unchanged. Currency remains positive and if rates hold near current levels, we would expect second quarter sales to be favorably impacted by approximately 3% to 4% when compared to 2010. Using current rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales would be an increase in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% when compared to 2010, up from the original expectation of 0.5% to 1.5%. We are maintaining our outlook calling for net sales of 11% -- a net sales increase of 11% to 13% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as acquisitions, sales growth is projected to be 5% to 7% for the full year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $3.65 to $3.73 range, representing an increase of 10% to 12% over 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "We also now anticipate acquisition and integration-related charges associated with the recently completed Neurovascular business to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.28 to $0.30 versus the previously noted $0.21 to $0.25, driven by higher costs associated with the inventory step-up, while other integration costs remain on or ahead of plan. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks, Curt. In closing, our Q1 results put us on track to deliver on the commitments we outlined at the start of the year. Moreover, the balance provided by our portfolio continues to reinforce the strength of our strategic focus on strengthening our core and broadening in the key adjacent markets. We remain focused on maximizing shareholder return through a multi-pronged cash strategy that leverages our balance sheet as evidenced by our ongoing pursuit of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchases.", "We look forward to executing on our financial goals and delivering strong results that will continue to define Stryker as a leading player in the medical technology market.", "With that, we'll now open it up for Q&A, Jonathan.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Mr. Rick Wise with Leerink Swann.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Maybe we can talk a little bit about -- start off with Recon talk with the market a little bit. As you indicated, it still sounds like market growth is challenged. Can you talk on the Knee side a little bit, Steve, about OtisMed and where you stand in terms of getting the products you need? And maybe talk a little bit more, flesh out your comments about the rollout of the new Hip products? And when -- I mean clearly it seems like you've outperformed, but when do you expect that slow-moving train to pick up a little more steam?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure, Rick. On OtisMed, it is back with the FDA. We got a 510(k) with them going through the review process. I think just given where things are with FDA these days, we're just leery of committing to when that might be. We would certainly hope it will be before the end of the year, but that one has clearly turned out to be a little more complicated for us than our initial expectations. On the Hip business, I think while the hip market looks soft, we really like where we are and I think the rollout of MDM, which is we launched kind of the academy and it's just in the early innings of getting the rollout, we should start to see some pickup on that here in the second quarter, but continuing to build through the year. And we think that MDM, all the surgeon feedback that I've picked up, MDM ought to be a much bigger addition to our portfolio than the ADM was last year and it's a great build on that. So I think we're a lot more excited about where that's going.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "And just the follow-up maybe on earnings. Clearly, you've kept your guidance range stable but you are talking about lower tax rates and following first quarter results might should be a little bit more comfortable at the mid to upper end of that range given the way the acquisitions are performing, et cetera?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Rick, I think what we wanted or what we tried to call out on the tax rate discussion is, while we're adjusting that range a little bit lower, keep in mind there's a comparable offset up in SG&A as it directly relates to the Puerto Rico excise tax credit that we're able to take and that the IRS is opined upon. And that's really where the tax rate adjustment comes into play. So it's not necessarily an enhancement to earnings. Overall, we have one quarter under our belt. We feel good about the results. I think it would be premature to make a comment where we feel we're going to fall within the current range of $3.65 to $3.73.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "So, a question first on just the Knee side of the business. Katherine, you called out sort of there's much of the conditions in the market that have been with us for several quarters remained intact. Knee, so far, even though it's kind of early in the reporting season, the season is shaping up to be a little on the weak side. Do you look at this as, is it -- do you believe that it's a market softness in the first quarter? Is it comps? Or should we be concerned that there's any transfer of share [ph] here the first quarter? And then I have one follow-up.", "Stephen MacMillan", "I don't think we lost share, Matt. I think it's more of a softness in the market and it feels like to us the Knees have been a little bit more susceptible to the economic downturn. Some of the patients tend to be a little younger as you know, and probably have been slightly more deferred. I Actually am very encouraged, I think we're encouraged, while we don't like the numbers, the fact that we're probably the only company without a ShapeMatch technology out there, I think speaks to the strength of Triathlon, that when the dust settles here for the quarter, we think our Knee numbers won't be that bad. We probably did not lose share in the quarter.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Okay, then one follow-up on Neurovascular. Just from your comments, it's hard to see, given your new reporting lines, but relative to where you started the year, we're one quarter in, I mean, is it off to a slightly stronger start than you hoped for? Is it right in-line with your expectations? Any color on just how you think Neurovascular is tracking at this point?", "Curt Hartman", "If I understood the scope of the question, through one quarter we feel good about Neurovascular, and there's two sides to that statement. There's the integration and ongoing integration efforts. Those are largely on track with our expectations. On the commercial side of the business, where I suspect the majority of your question is focused, we're encouraged by the early results of the Target coil introduction, which was principally focused in the U.S. market and in select international markets, we're very early there on the Target coil launch. And so far, so good; keeping in mind in both cases, it's still only 90 days into the program underneath Stryker and with the new product. So I would say quarter one is about in line with our expectations as we built our models, and we're hopeful that we can continue on that path.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I actually have two. One, your 37% plus or minus SG&A rate is sort of where you've been looking at for the last couple of quarters, is this sort of a new go-forward rate that we should think about?", "Curt Hartman", "It's a great question. I've always tried to qualify that with a final statement saying we are comfortable with variations here, because those are the areas where we elect to make investments in selling organizations, marketing programs, and we want to retain that flexibility and certainly we think that our P&L allows us to retain that flexibility. As of right now, that flexibility has been deployed into R&D as evidenced by the last, say, three or four quarters increase in R&D. As a matter of routine, I think we said that in 2011, we thought that, that broad SG&A category would be in that 37% to 38% range, and after one quarter, we think we are on track with that, always reserving the right to make select investments in various marketing or sales programs.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then as a second question, what surprised you, positive or negative, now that you've owned the Neuro division for 90 days?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I heard you say the positive. The real positive of that business is the team. We absolutely love the leadership team and the quality of the team that came over. I think to build on it from there, Joanne, we probably are very cautiously optimistic about the initial rollout of the Target coil, particularly in the U.S., and we just don't want to get ahead of ourselves here, but it's off to a nice start.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "A couple of questions. Let me just start with kind of this big picture from the first quarter, the Ortho business, as you traditionally reported it,  doesn't grow this quarter in constant currency and MedSurg has had a very, very strong quarter. Does seeing this three months into the year change how you're budgeting for the year and your spending across various businesses?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Not dramatically, Mike. We've always got a little bit of swings and roundabouts, and I think the funny part, as you well know, over a number of years here, our MedSurg business is probably consistently more on the upside, and Recon's been a little slower. I think you more than even some others had been predicting the first quarter was still going to be a challenging one in Ortho and I think your hypothesis there was accurate and I think it's all within our realm and it just speaks broadly to our broader strategy, which is we're much more than a hip and a knee company. We love our hip and knee franchises, but like the overall piece and have enough flexibility in there to continue to deliver very good results even in a soft recon market, much as we did for much of last year.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Curt, can you just chime in on FX? I think most people view Stryker's having some natural hedges in place but not having an active synthetic strategy for translational risk and so the fact that you've had this incremental tailwind develop over the last three months to the top line, people would like to get some view on the bottom line benefit over the balance of the year and why you didn't reflect that in your updated guidance?", "Curt Hartman", "I think, number one, your opening statement is correct. We don't have -- we view ourselves as having more natural hedges than we do any form of synthetic hedge; that's an accurate statement. The top line and what we try to guide people to over the last couple of years is that it's not simply a straight drop through any top line impact of FX to the bottom line that was really I think reflected last year as you looked at the swings in the multi-currency payors from our manufacturing network to our distribution network and how that moved across the gross margins. And therefore, when we look at the FX potential impact that we've modeled, based on current rates, the drop-through that we're seeing right now is not meaningful from an EPS impact and therefore, would not yield us to move the overall outlook. And again, probably be updating currency rates in 30, 60, 90 days depending on how faster or how volatile the global economy is. If we go back to 2010, it seem like about once a month we are trying to make an adjustment on currency.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jefferies & Company.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Wonder if I could ask a little about -- you mentioned the MedSurg division continues to kind of defy some of the skeptics out there and again, you put up a very strong quarter, particularly it looks like in the international markets. I was curious if you could comment just on what you're seeing on the demand side there. There's obviously some concern about what might happen in Europe with some of the budgetary concerns there, but maybe just option thoughts around the outlook.", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think the big issue that we would say with our MedSurg business is first and foremost, we had said throughout 2010, we didn't think there's it was one-hit wonder '09 comps that was really more a little bit back to return it to historically strong business results. The other piece that we said is relates particularly the international business is for both Instruments and Endoscopy. They've been relatively underdeveloped outside the United States. So we have seen even in a slow market the ability to gain market share for those franchises, and I think that's what we're really seeing and we continue to feel great about those businesses.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And just on Japan, and I don't think you mentioned in your prepared remarks. Have you seen any impact and you're expecting to see any sort of lingering impacts of the events in Japan?", "Stephen MacMillan", "We saw truthfully very little. I mean, it was marginal. Certainly some hospitals, some franchises experienced it. I think the bigger concern for us frankly and it again and everything is manageable when you have multi-franchises. Our Endoscopy division in the second and third quarters might experience some shipment delays from some of the products that we source out of Japan, but again, it'll be de minimis, so nothing that we're particularly worried about.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Given the speculation out there about potential acquisition of Synthes by J&J, I was just wondering if you have any perspective on how that could potentially impact your Spine and Trauma businesses. It seems like there might be an opportunity to pick up some market share there. I was just wondering if you would agree with that.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I think at this point given there's nothing been publicly announced, we typically wouldn't comment. I think as people seen in any acquisition, particularly sizable ones, there can be disruption and opportunities and challenges for the acquiring company, but beyond that, we wouldn't make any specific comments since it would truly be very speculative at this time.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay, and then second question on the Spine business, can you just remind us where you're at with your CerviCore cervical disc approval?", "Curt Hartman", "Right now the status is we continue to work on the product in preparation for submission. That's probably about the extent of information we would discuss on that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jason Wittes with Caris & Company.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company", "First a follow-up from Raj's question about OUS growth. As you guys may know, I've been off the sale side for a little while and just came back, but if I look back three years ago, I remember that OUS was a pretty big opportunity in terms of under-penetration for you guys, but as I come back and look at the numbers, it's still not as present as I would have expected. But now you're saying that you're starting to gain share. Is there a change in strategy that's occurring right now?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, it's a little more of a focus for our international division, particularly on Instruments and Endoscopy, but candidly, we have not made the progress we'd like, partially, because, particularly our MedSurg business has continued to grow pretty well in the U.S. And so to balance it much differently, it just hasn't really made a huge headway. We still see bigger opportunities going forward, Jason.", "Curt Hartman", "I think also, Jason, if you look over those last three years that you referenced, a couple of those recovered by the economic contraction and like all companies, we had to pull back on some of our investments, and some of those new expansions were the subject to some of those reductions during that period of time.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company", "Okay, just one more, if I look at what you're saying, you're basically saying that price is pretty stable in terms of all your businesses. Mix, you sort of have -- I imagine you have some visibility on the volumes, especially in the Orthopaedic business are not something you have a lot of visibility on. Is that a fair characterization of the way things are right now? I mean, obviously, everything looks pretty stable, but if I look at the three components, the volume piece is sort of what you're waiting for and you don't really have, sort of beyond, maybe a quarter visibility.", "Katherine Owen", "Let's say on the Reconstructive Implant business, where we've clearly seen a softening as the overall market seen that deferral of procedures. It doesn't seem to be getting markedly worse, but clearly, there hasn't been a rebound and we would say that's probably tied more to visibility around just an overall improvement in the economic environment.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company", "So basically, you're looking to the economy as the driver there in terms -- as opposed to checks from your sales people and doctors in terms of what they're saying, in terms of patient backlog, et cetera.", "Katherine Owen", "No, what we're saying is, we think the input overseas from the various channels and market intelligence we do via talking to patients or doctors or our sales force or hospital administrators, et cetera. The input we received from that probably won't materially change as it relates to elective procedures until we see some improvement in the economic environment since there's a very clear tie into unemployment, particularly as the average age of the implant recipient has been coming down and its been compounded by some of the extra pressures tied to increasing deductibles, et cetera. And I would acknowledge clearly Q1 is the hardest comp quarter, and as the year unfolds, we should see easing comps as well as the benefit from the uptake on MDMs, specifically on the Hip side as well as the rollout of OtisMed, ADM and MDM internationally.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Mr. David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Steve, what is clear over the last few quarters and specifically this quarter is, MedSurg is clearly accelerating. I know you've tried to talk us away from thinking about your year-over-year comps, but it does look like accelerating. What's less clear to us is the pieces that are accelerating, the pieces that are doing well. There's actually a fair amount of sort of inorganic stuff in there now between Ascent as well as Gaymar. Can you help us kind of draw a picture between the core Stryker and Endoscopy and beds, and the more recent Stryker, which is some of the new acquisitions?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, take this really simply, David. Our Endoscopy and Instruments businesses, both of which grew at double-digit rates in the U.S. and outside the U.S., and therefore globally, is virtually entirely organic, if not completely organic growth. The Medical business has Gaymar dropped in there, which was worth a little bit of -- certainly some growth for them, and then Ascent is caught in the total MedSurg, and is growing. But clearly, the double-digit growth by Endo and Instruments is just very strong executional growth with product growth, sales growth and a lot of the singles that we talk about all the time. But make no mistake, that's very clearly organic growth.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "And then maybe another question on sort of organic trends, R&D elevated this quarter. I think it's the second straight quarter you've talked about this increasing R&D investment. Obviously, there's a step-up year-on-year because of Neurovasc. But when you think about the organic R&D being spent on the old Stryker, could you help us understand what that is growing at and give us a sense of where that's being spent because, obviously, it seems to be either accelerating or in excess of your peers?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Let me go back to last year, which is a very clean year with 17% increase for the year and if you particularly saw it, you saw a heavy increase in the second, third and fourth quarters. So I would say, David, as we made progress on our quality and compliance initiatives, where we really had re-diverted so many of our R&D resources for the previous few years, as we've gotten our new systems in place, we've gone back to starting to invest a little bit more in R&D, and it's across the board, it's every division. And again, as you know, our product line is deep and broad. Not a lot of home runs in it. It's spread across the board, each division continuing to see opportunities for innovation and opportunities for new niches and new product upgrades, and then we continued, as Curt mentioned, with double-digit increases even on the base business here in the first quarter. So, I think it's speaking to frankly as we look around, we still think there's a great opportunity for innovation in every category that we're in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford and Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "On your Hip business, while it looks like you may have grown in line this quarter -- last quarter you had a very strong above market growth rate that you put up in Hips. So, from a sequential basis, it looks like there's kind of a substantial step-down. Can you help us explain that? Was there something unique that happened last quarter that you're not seeing this quarter? Or what would you explain that sequential decrease?", "Katherine Owen", "Derrick, I'll take this. What we tried to comment on in the fourth quarter and be fairly consistent on is, it's very difficult to draw any major trends on a single quarter's results, and particularly in the hip and knee market where share shifts fairly slowly reinforced by the fact that the rest of the market is a sizable chunk that hasn't yet reported, so it's kind of hard to know where our numbers are going to shake out from a market share basis. But you really need to look at rolling fourth quarter trends to get a sense of who's gaining and who's losing share and who's staying stable. At this point, although nobody is pleased from a macro standpoint with a relatively softness in the hip and knee market, we feel very good, particularly our products roll out on MDM and over the course of this year and the international rollout of those products from a competitive position that we're in very good shape. I wouldn't point out anything that would say sequentially from Q4 to Q1 that there's a disconnect. Q4 tends to be a seasonally stronger quarter, and I think that's probably what partly drove a relatively stronger overall market in Q4, which is again why we've tried to be cautious because it's very difficult to draw any conclusions from just a sequential quarter comparison.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay, In your Endoscopy business, you saw very strong double-digit growth in the U.S. How much of that is kind of a -- how much of that is from timing of shipments or sales that were pushed off from the prior quarter, because I remember you mentioned that, that was an issue for some of the weakness that you saw last quarter. And how much of it is sort of organic? And can we expect it to see moving forward for the rest of the year?", "Curt Hartman", "Derrick, this is Curt. If I'm understanding your question, you're looking at our first quarter U.S. shipments for Endoscopy and questioning how much of that came from delayed shipments in the fourth quarter?", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "That's exactly right, Curt.", "Curt Hartman", "Certainly, a little bit of that happens over every year end as customers tend to get the end of their spending cycle, and they put a whole bunch of orders in. And then from a capacity standpoint, our ability to ship all those gets stretched. I don't think we're going to break that out as a percentage or a dollar basis. It's part of the normal year end process anytime you have capital equipment involved. So I think what you probably want to just look at is how those things have occurred year-over-year for a number of years, perhaps absent 2009. But certainly a little bit of that is influenced in the first quarter, but it doesn't materially change the results. Endoscopy had a good first quarter I think is the sound statement to make.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "My first question is on the Recon side. From a share standpoint, about 60%, actually a little bit more of that of the hip and knee market has reported at this point. Clearly, volumes seem to be tracking below the expectation of some others who have been a bit more bullish on the Recon recovery. Just to be clear, have you heard anything that would suggest there was an impact on volumes during the quarter, whether it was weather or flu or COBRA roll-offs? Or was Q1 really just a continuation of what we've seen over the last few quarters with some modest improvement in Q4?", "Katherine Owen", "I think we'd agree with your latter comment. A lot of the macro trends that we saw starting to emerge in Q2 last remain in effect, but nothing different that we would call out.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay, and then just moving to the P&L, there's been some focus on the fact that the environment is becoming a bit more inflationary, oil prices are up, some other component prices seem to be rising. Anything that we should be focused on specific to Stryker as we model out the rest of the year, specifically at the gross margin line?", "Curt Hartman", "Nothing that would be of a material nature that we would discuss.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Just wanted to just ask you guys about the components of your revenue guidance here. And then certainly, I know you don't give specific targets but just it seems like relative to most of the Street models and in the quarter, Ortho was weak and MedSurg was stronger than expected, so, I mean as you guys think about it relative to what you were thinking for the quarter, is that the right way to look at it?", "Curt Hartman", "Was the question in reference to the first quarter or our outlook?", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Well, I guess both. But I guess should we think about once getting -- I know you guys didn't give specific guidance by segment, but just relative to most of the models, it seems like the MedSurg was stronger than expected and Ortho being weaker. So, I guess, as you guys were thinking about coming into the quarter, maybe that was the way you guys were thinking about it and the Street models were up. But just curious or are you guys even though you're keeping your revenue guidance the same, should we think about the growth drivers as being different?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, I think it's a very good observation. I'd say a lot of ways it probably paralleled last year as well. If you look at your original budget for 2010, we would have forecasted better Recon and generally Orthopaedic Implant growth and lesser MedSurg, and at the end of the year, I think it speaks to the fact that how strong our total company is. As you well know, we exceeded our original guidance for last year, even in a year when the Recon market did things that none of us anticipated. I think certainly our Recon business was softer this quarter than we would've fully budgeted. I would also tell you we're very much almost exactly on plan with what we planned for the year. And every year, we get there in different ways. So I think you're spot on.", "Adam Feinstein - Barclays Capital", "Great, and just a quick follow-up. Just with the M&A environment heating up in recent days, obviously  you guys just closed on a big deal, but what is your appetite in terms of doing additional deals? And how are you thinking about utilizing your cash?", "Katherine Owen", "I would say really no change to what we've been articulating and probably people are familiar with it. It's a three-pronged cash strategy, it's M&A, it's dividend and it's buybacks. In M&A, we're going to be primarily focused on transactions in our core like the Gaymar, like Porex, as well as key adjacent markets like Neurovascular and that is the game plan and that's going to continue going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "So first question is on organic constant currency revenue growth. I think you guys reported a little over 10% constant currency growth and then about 6% growth from deals which gets you to about 4% constant currency organic growth in the quarter, which; one, is my math right? And two, if it is right, that's a little bit below the 5% to 7% you forecast for the year. So what do you expect to accelerate as we go forward here?", "Curt Hartman", "Bob, number one, your math is right. Number two, and I hate to use comparables as the excuse, but Q1 2010 is our toughest comparable when you look broadly at all the totality of the Stryker franchises. So as we look forward, we still think the 5% to 7% range is the right range based on what's being projected based on how we see the markets unfolding.", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Anything product-related though, sorry to follow up on that.", "Curt Hartman", "New product wise that will drive?", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, any major new product launches in the back three quarters that would drive acceleration?", "Curt Hartman", "Well, I think part of it is on the Reconstructive side, the expectation of how MDM would be embraced by the market coming on the heels of ADM, and the timing that it takes to roll sets out, do surgeon training. Some of that groundwork was laid with ADM, so our expectation is that MDM will pick up. We've got other franchises have what Steve refers to as singles and doubles that continue to rollout, and those tend to build month-over-month as the year progresses. So I wouldn't call out any one item. I would just say it's a bunch of singles and doubles right now in the core business.", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "And then just follow up on the Knee side. Everyone that's reported Knee numbers so far has reported sequential deceleration. Everyone is reporting negative growth, and I understand comps are a little bit tougher this quarter, but do you really feel that the knee market is stable here? Everyone keeps using this word stable, but it doesn't really seem to be that way when you just look at the numbers. J&J tried to point us to sequential growth trends. So I was just wondering if I can get your comments on the knee market? Do you really think it's stable here and this is just tough comps in the quarter or has there been a little bit of a sequential deceleration in your view?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think stable is a fair characterization, yes. Clearly, in the  second quarter last year things changed. I think it's hit a new period, but I don't think it's falling much further at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Rajeev Jashnani with UBS.", "Rajeev Jashnani - Civic", "With respect to gross margin going forward, I was just wondering if you could comment on, with the mix of businesses, how you see gross margin unfolding really not so much over the year but longer term.", "Curt Hartman", "Clearly, we've tried over the last 18 to 24 months to take some steps organizationally to provide additional focus at the gross margin line, the first being the appointment of an executive over our global quality and manufacturing. Coming from a highly decentralized org structure, we believe there are opportunities within our manufacturing network for things as simple as synergies across spend categories, core competency manufacturing. However, each one of those initiatives is predicated on first making no dramatic change that impacts the hard work that many people in the company have done on the quality front. So we've tried to signal that longer term, we see opportunity in gross margin, recognizing that it will be tempered a little bit with the first focus on quality, and number two, tempered in a fashion such that we may need every one of those gross margin dollars to offset other challenges that come into the business, be they declines in price or commodity price changes, labor rate changes in various markets. So we think there's opportunity, but it's not going to materialize three, six, nine, 12 months. It's going to materialize over time.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "Katherine, I was wondering in the beginning of your remarks you had commented on pricing mix trends. For the Recon business, in the U.S., was pricing and mix still negative? I recognize Hips is probably doing better with the rollouts, but can you just maybe help us understanding in aggregate if it's still negative and maybe give us an update on what's going on in Europe? If I look at the businesses, it looks like Europe is still obviously a bit of a problem spot. It looks like Trauma and extremities was a bit soft this quarter. So just any broad comments on Europe and when we might expect a recovery specific to the Recon business?", "Katherine Owen", "All right, on the pricing, pricing as we try to kind of give some qualitative directionality around it, if pricing in Hips and Knees is still negative, it was marginally better sequentially, and it is partly offset by mix with a little bit better contribution on the Hip side, which you would probably expect given ADM and MDM. But I wouldn't call it materially different, but marginally better from a Q4 to Q1 basis. And with respect to Europe, there is nothing significant that we'd point out as a departure from prior trends. We are working through some of the fallout as we talked about from the move we made over a year ago to discontinue certain products and terminate certain distributors, which did upset certain customers and there's work to do to build those relationships back up. On the positive side, we are rolling out OtisMed internationally, ADM and the MDM as well. So there's some nice components coming on the new product side, which will certainly help and in particularly as we get to the back half of the year because as you know with the Recon products, it does take a little bit of time to get traction there.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, great. And then on Ascent, if I look at kind of the numbers reported, it looks like that business was up only about 6%. Can you just comment on trends there and can we expect, I know this is being greedy, but any historical restatements to help us kind of rebuilt models in the new reporting style?", "Curt Hartman", "I'll take the second question first. The restatement we've provided some detail that goes back through 2010 in the press release by the new reporting segments. Your question relative to Ascent probably back into some rough estimates on how that business did in the first quarter. As with any business that disrupts markets, challenges competitors, there's likely to be quarter-over-quarter disruptions, but I think the broad story on Ascent is we feel very good about the direction of that business. We think we're on the right side of the cost question as it relates to hospital supply and over the long term, the thesis that we went into the Ascent acquisition with remains very much in place. And we think over the long term, this is going to be one of the great franchises for Stryker. We're not too wrapped up in this sort of quarter-over-quarter variations right now.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "But you are not going to give out like Hip numbers, Knee numbers and that? I see that it's just about major divisions historically?", "Curt Hartman", "This is the top segment. You're correct. We're not going to go back into the Hip, Knee and restate that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Brien with William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Just a follow-up on Kristen's question a little bit. On the mix side of things, compared to historical levels, are you still able to get the same type of pricing premium on new products that you're introducing? Or is that narrowing slightly on this environment?", "Curt Hartman", "I think right now without getting into specifics, we feel good about the ability of new technology to drive a price premium. I think the question -- and I think we've talked about this a little bit on the last call was that, that perhaps the tail on that price premium was a little bit shorter than it had historically been. And that's probably direct outcome of better pricing transparency as comes about with better healthcare's IT systems and/or consultant groups out there that sell services around pricing. But in general, across the portfolio of Stryker products, new innovation is still able to command a price premium.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay, and then one quick follow-up. As far as you made some comments on Interventional Spine being pretty strong, and it looks like it was primarily internationally. Can you just provide a little more color on what's driving that growth?", "Curt Hartman", "The Interventional Spine business has a number of product platforms in it. What I would probably point to as the segment or the franchise there is an item we introduced about a year ago called the iVAS balloon technology for vertebral compression fractures. And as our selling organizations, both in the U.S. and globally, have been able to introduce that technology to customers and show the totality of our portfolio, we're the sole company who can do both vertebroplasty and khypoplasty approaches, inclusive of not only the devices, but also the cements. We've had a wonderful customer reception with that and it's simply going through the training, education and distribution pathways, and we like the direction that, that business is headed.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Just a real quick follow-up on that. Are you seeing -- I know you're a smaller player there, but are volumes improving? Or are they just strictly a share-taking event for you?", "Curt Hartman", "Well, it's probably a little of both. Vertebral compression fractures aren't going away. There is roughly 700,000 new ones a year. There's been some reimbursement pushback based on different market segments, but in studies that have come out, but each of those has been disputed, and you still have patients with pain, and long term, we still like the outlook for the market.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Charles Chon with Stifel Nicolaus.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Curt, just a quick follow-up to a question that was asked before. You discussed that even though organic growth came in at 4% for the quarter, the 5% to 7% organic growth guidance is the right range for 2011. Is that to suggest that based on what you're seeing in the second quarter thus far, considering that year-over-year growth comparisons are easing from the first quarter to second quarter that all the businesses are trending better?", "Curt Hartman", "We're not going to get into any comments relative to the second quarter. We're not finished reporting the first one. It's to suggest that, number one; the first quarter is a tough year-over-year comparable when we look across our broad franchises; and number two, we still like the product lineup in the core business across all of our franchises and how that plays out in the global markets.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, and just the other question on that is just, is it possible that year-over-year seasonality could be -- or I'm sorry, sequential seasonality could be changing in any way, so whereas historically we would see decent growth through most of the year with the exception of the summer months, that now in the post recession environment, procedures are just now being more loaded into the back half of the year?", "Curt Hartman", "I think there's certainly been a transition. It's hard to quantify, but I think you've seen volume increases in the fourth quarter. And I think that coincides with higher deductible levels that people are experiencing. And I think it probably has been influenced somewhat by the global environment. So we have seen what we think are different patterns in the fourth quarter as compared to say, years before '07, '08.", "Charles Chon - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Right. That's what I was thinking. Just real question on Target coil. Can you give us a status update on where the launch is? At the time of the International Stroke Conference, it seemed that Stryker was conducting a very controlled launch with substantial case support and monitoring. It seems that Neurovascular was selling out of all the Target coils that you were making. Can you give us an idea of where we stand now with that launch?", "Curt Hartman", "I think in my opening comments, we said the focus of the Target coil launch had been the U.S. market, and we're starting the introduction of that in the international markets. Obviously, it's a very complex manufacturing process. And we're pleased with the progress on the manufacturing side. And to the extent that supply continues to increase at the rate it has, we'll be able to further expand the selling, marketing effort on a global basis. So first 90 days really focused in the U.S. market and continuing to roll across the various international markets and really trying to be mindful of the customer base here. It's a small tightly knit society, and we want to do our best to get the product in front of all of our clinicians. That's really hard to do on a global basis in addition to working through all the regulatory approvals, but that's the path we're on. We're trying to stay in high touch with all of our customers, communicate with them, clear expectations and we hope that through the second quarter here we're able to continue on that path.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Steve, a couple of questions, I guess. Let me start on the Spine business. Any comments you're going to make on your Spine results in the quarter? Any change maybe you're seeing in market dynamics, whether it's pricing in the U.S. or commercial payor approval rates, anything along those lines?", "Stephen MacMillan", "I don't think we saw much change really from second half of last year to be honest. And obviously, it looks like a very weak market right now. I think the three companies that have reported last week have all been minus one in the U.S. and we were right in that line. None of us have that problem [ph].", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And how would you, Steve, expect that to maybe trend over the next few quarters? Obviously, involved in a legal dispute with one of your bigger competitors there? Should we think of legal expenses going up for that or potentially the Spine growth rate ticking down or is it too small to matter at this point?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Too small to matter. I think we're focused on getting our product flow improved out of that business as we've been talking about for some time. We've got some new leadership in there and feeling good about where to go, but as you well know, any of the Implant businesses take some time to re-accelerate momentum.", "Stephen MacMillan", "I think that was the last call Jonathan?", "Operator", "Yes, sir. That was the last question in queue, sir.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us today and hopefully, you'll see again. We continue to deliver the strength of our broad-based model, and our conference call for our second quarter operating results will be held on July 19, 2011.

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. ", "I would now like to read the forward-looking statement. Certain statements made in this presentation may contain information that includes, or is based on forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities Law that are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.", "Such factors include, but are not limited to, weakening of the economic conditions that could adversely affect the level of demand for the company's products; pricing pressures, generally, including cost containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the company's products; changes in foreign exchange markets; legislative and regulatory actions; unanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and otherwise that affect U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of new products; changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payers; a significant increase in product liability claims; unfavorable resolution of tax audits; changes in financial markets; changes in competitive environment and the company's ability to integrate acquisitions.", "Additionally, information concerning these and other factors are contained in the company's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission including the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen MacMillan, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thank you, Derek. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's Second Quarter 2011 Earnings Report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Consistent with prior calls, I will make some summary comments regarding our quarterly results before passing the call over to Katherine and Curt to provide more specifics. ", "We'll start with a summary of some of the key accomplishments realized in the second quarter. With sales coming in at over $2 billion, we delivered a 16% increase with a 6% gain, excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, representing a solid 2-point acceleration in our underlying organic growth from Q1. And with double-digit constant currency growth for both our U.S. and International businesses, the top line performance was geographically balanced. ", "Two, our Reconstructive businesses, including Hips, Knees and Trauma, achieved stronger top line growth sequentially. ", "Three, meanwhile, our MedSurg franchises once again helped drive our double-digit top line with Medical the clear standout at 39% growth, and our Neurotechnology business continued to build on the momentum achieved in Q1 due in large part to the ongoing rollout of the Neurovascular product offering, while our Spine franchise also saw sequential improvement as well.", "Four, our solid sales growth contributed to a 13% increase in adjusted diluted net earnings per share to $0.90. ", "Five, we also continue to strengthen our core product offering and utilize our cash flow with the announcement of 2 acquisitions during the quarter, Orthovita and Memometal, both of which have since closed. We are excited about the opportunity to leverage each company's unique product offering through our considerable sales force to drive stronger top line growth. ", "As always, given the considerable breadth and size of our myriad businesses, each quarter presents us with some challenges. Although we are pleased with the building momentum in our Hip business and the expectation from improving Knee growth, given the recent FDA clearance of our customized cutting guides, the overall macroenvironment remains difficult. Nonetheless, we believe we are well positioned to gain market share in both Hips and Knees on the heels of new product launches.", "In summary, our Q2 results underscore a recurring theme that many of you who have followed our company are familiar with, the benefits provided by the balanced diversity of our businesses and our unique sales footprint that spans medical device implants as well as key operating room disposables and capital equipment. This model provides tremendous overall consistency of our financial results, and we believe will increasingly differentiate us with our hospital customers. ", "We started the year with the expectation we would deliver adjusted diluted EPS in the range of $3.65 to $3.73, an increase of 10% to 13%. Given our solid performance through the first 6 months of 2011, we remain confident in our outlook for both sales and earnings. We will continue to focus on leveraging our unique sales footprint to accelerate growth organically through internal R&D, along with supplemental acquisitions while maximizing shareholder returns through dividends and share buybacks. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Steve. Similar to prior quarters, my comments today will focus on acquisitions, elective procedure trends and implant pricing. ", "First, on the acquisition front, we continue to execute on our stated strategy of leveraging our balance sheet and cash flow to pursue M&A. As you are aware, we completed the acquisition of Neurovascular in the first quarter and continue to be pleased with the market's reception to the new product offering that includes both the next generation coil as well as detachment system. ", "Turning to Q2, we announced 2 more acquisitions that are focused on strengthening our core product offering and leveraging our broad distribution channel and selling capabilities, a key aspect of our M&A strategy. ", "Specifically in late June, we closed on the acquisition of Orthovita, which competes in the $5 billion orthobiologics markets and is a global leader in synthetic bone grafts with its Vitoss product offering and also competes in vertebral augmentation with its CORTOSS product offering. ", "In addition, the company's biosurgery business manufactures hemostasis product such as the Vitagel, which are designed to control interoperative and postoperative bleeding. We believe the collective talent of our sizable sales forces across multiple franchises positions us to build on Orthovita's success and accelerate sales growth.", "In early July, we closed on the acquisition of privately held Memometal, which manufactures and markets products for extremity indication based on its proprietary methods for preparing and manufacturing a shape memory metal alloy. Memometal is rapidly establishing its differentiated technology in the global extremity device market with a broad range of products for the foot and ankle as well as the hand and ribs. With sales in 2010 of roughly $30 million, Memometal's comprehensive and proprietary product portfolio allows us to gain broader access into the fast-growing extremities market. ", "We're excited about the prospects for both of these most recent acquisitions, and similar to prior BD deals, we look for them to help drive our long-term organic growth.", "Shifting to elective procedures, the macro backdrop and current challenges remains similar to that what we've experienced in recent quarters. As most of you are aware, the ongoing economic softness has been contributing to a slowdown in many elective procedures, including hip and knee replacement. However, despite the current pressures on procedures, we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing from both our new product offering particularly with hips as a combination of ADM, and more recently, MDM, is helping drive accelerating sales growth. Although our knee performance strengthened sequentially, there's clearly room for improvement and we expect that Q2 510(k) clearance of our customized cutting guide to help drive share gains in the second half of 2011. ", "Lastly, on the implant pricing front, the trends are similar to prior quarters, with continued but stable pricing pressure partly offset by mix, particularly as it relates to Hips given the new product launches. ", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. I'll start by saying that at the halfway point, our results and the corresponding financial performance are largely on track with goals we've stated at the beginning of the year. ", "Jumping into the second quarter, company sales increased 16.3% on a reported basis and 11.9% on a constant currency basis. The underlying core business growth, excluding currency and acquisition impact, improved 5.7% versus the 4% in the first quarter. ", "On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.79, a decrease of 1.3% versus Q2 of 2010. Excluding acquisition-related charges, increases are reported U.S. GAAP diluted net earnings per share of $0.79 to $0.90 per share. The U.S. GAAP diluted net earnings per share decline of 1% then becomes growth of 12.5% when excluding the identified non-GAAP items. ", "Overall, strong results from MedSurg and the Neurotechnology and Spine segments, coupled with the improving results in Reconstructive, supported top line growth. In general, we're pleased with the momentum we're seeing. Further, our acquisitions continue to perform as expected and our integration efforts remain largely on track. ", "With that said, and as we discussed previously, our investments and acquisition integration and the normal cycle of business have resulted in some variation in the presentation of the P&L, which I will discuss in further detail.", "In reviewing the quarter, I'll start with the discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the second quarter, volume and mix contributed 7.2% to the top line, while company-wide selling prices declined 1.5%, improving from the first quarter's 2% decline, but fundamentally in line with recent trends. Acquisitions added 6.2%, and currency contributed to an increase in top line sales by approximately $78 million and improve the company's overall reported sales growth by 4.4%. ", "Looking at our external reporting segments, I'll start with Reconstructive products, which represented 45% of our sales in the quarter. Reconstructive products include our Hip, Knee, Trauma and other Reconstructive lines. As noted in the press release, Reconstructive products recorded a 7% increase as reported, and a 2% increase on a constant currency basis. This was up from the 2% reported in flat constant currency growth in the first quarter.", "Knee sales remain challenging, again, influenced by a softer market and our lack of a commercial shape matching offering. Our Hip line performed better and strengthened to 11% reported growth and 4% constant currency growth, increasing from the 5% reported and 2% constant currency first quarter rates. ", "Globally, Trauma posted decent results at 11% reported growth and 4% constant currency growth. Overall, we feel we are starting to see the early signs of the positive impact that our Hip lineup is having and remain encouraged on Knees, given the recent OtisMed shape matching approval and its potential influence on the second half of 2011.", "Next, I'll turn to the MedSurg segment, which represented 38% of sales in the quarter. For reporting purposes, MedSurg today is comprised of instruments, endoscopy, medical and the Ascent Healthcare business, which we have renamed Stryker Sustainability Solutions. ", "MedSurg sales increased a strong 15% as reported and 12% on a constant currency basis. Acquisition added 1.9% to the reported increase. Overall, the Medical segment was the star of the show, delivering 39% reported growth or 27% excluding acquisition and currency. From a market perspective, sales remained strong in both our bed and stretcher offering, fueled by the replacement and upgrade market. ", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represented 17% of company sales in the quarter, increased 53% as reported and 49% on a constant currency basis. Adjusting for acquisitions and currency, Neurotechnology and Spine sales reported a 7% increase. Highlights in the quarter include exceptionally strong organic growth from our Interventional Spine and NSE offerings, as well as the positive influence of the MEDPOR and Neurovascular acquisitions. Spine implant sales remain challenged, but did record positive global constant currency growth in the quarter. ", "Finally, the progress of the Neurovascular business, both from a commercial and integration standpoint, remains on track. Quarterly results included continued strong performance in the U.S. market, as well as positive growth in the international market on the strength of the Target Coil rollout.", "Now turning to the income statement beginning with our gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins declined 410 basis points to 65.2% as a result of the Neurovascular acquisition inventory step-up, which totaled approximately $55 million. Excluding this charge, margins were 67.8% in the second quarter, which was lower than the prior year by 150 basis points. I would remind everyone that as we discussed last year, our second and third quarter 2010 gross margins were favorably impacted by currency. This year, the impact of the weaker dollar on purchases from our international manufacturing operations is putting pressure on margins. Given first half results and current currency trends, we now forecast margins for the year in the 68% to 68.5% range. ", "Research and development continued as an area of investment priority moving to 5.6% of sales, an increase of 21% versus the second quarter of 2010. Absent the influence of the Neurovascular business, total company R&D spend increased 9%.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 38.4% of sales adjusting for acquisition and integration-related charges for the Neurovascular and Orthovita acquisitions. SG&A finished at 38% of sales. Of note, we did settle an IP litigation issue in the quarter that drove G&A higher.", "Reported operating income decreased 11% over prior year and moved to 20% of sales, reflecting the impact of the Neurovascular inventory step-up and other acquisition and integration-related charges. Adjusted operating income increased 4%, while the adjusted operating margin decreased 280 basis points versus prior year to 22.7% of sales. Other income and expense increased pretax income by $10 million in the quarter. Components of this included investment income of $9 million and a $1 million positive impact from interest expense. This is a result of the reversal of tax interest from accruals, following the effective closing of tax years 2007 and prior for U.S. federal tax matters with the exception of the IRS cost-sharing controversy. Overall, the best way to think about this is that our legal settlement and G&A was generally offset by the favorable interest in the interest expense line.", "The company's effective income tax rate was 24.6% for the second quarter of 2011. Excluding the tax benefit associated with the Neurovascular inventory step-up and other acquisition-related charges, our effective income tax rate would have been 25.7% for the second quarter. ", "During the quarter, we settled an open tax controversy with respect to our Puerto Rico subsidiary for years 2006 through 2009, and additionally, as previously mentioned, also effectively closed 2007 in prior years for federal U.S. tax matters with the exception of our IRS cost-sharing matter. ", "Overall, the net impact of these items on our tax expense was insignificant in the quarter. For the year-to-date, our tax rate, excluding the acquisition-related charges, is 25.9%, and we are comfortable with this for the year, although we know there is downward bias on the rate.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $2.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, down $1.7 billion from year-end 2010. This balance has been reduced by both the January 3 closing of the NV transaction and the associated $1.45 billion payment, and the June 28 closing of the Orthovita transaction and the $0.33 billion cash payment. As a reminder, we have $1 billion of debt on the balance sheet associated with our January 2010 debt offering.", "On the asset management side, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 59, which represented an increase of 2 days compared to the prior year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 164, which was up 3 days sequentially versus the first quarter and 1 day against prior year level. The impact of acquisition-related inventory step-up on the P&L, netted a higher dollar amount running [ph] through the cost of goods and impacted the DII calculation by reducing days in inventory by 10 days. Keep in mind, this includes both step-up for the Neurovascular and Orthovita acquisitions.", "Turning to cash. In the second quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $156 million and free cash flow of $106 million. We expect to pick up the pace here in the second half. ", "Finally, there were no share repurchases in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 4 million shares for a total spend of $250 million. We currently have open authorizations totaling approximately $575 million.", "In summary, the second quarter was solid and, through the first 6 months, we are on track with our annual goals. Key objectives in the second half include continued acquisition integration, operational focus and a sharpened focus on cash generation. ", "Turning to our outlook, our guidance, as Steve noted, remains unchanged. Currency remains a positive, and if rates hold near current levels, we would expect third quarter sales to be favorably impacted by approximately 2.5% to 3.5% when compared to 2010. Using current rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales would be an increase in the range of 2% to 3% when compared to 2010, up from the original expectation of 0.5% to 1.5%. We are maintaining our outlook calling for net sales increase of 11% to 13% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of foreign currency as well as acquisitions, sales growth is projected to be 5% to 7% for the full year. ", "Adjusted diluted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $3.65 to $3.73 range, representing an increase of 10% to 12% over 2010 adjusted diluted earnings per share.", "Finally, we now anticipate acquisition and integration-related charges associated with the Neurovascular business and recently completed Orthovita business acquisition to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.33 to $0.35 versus the previously noted $0.28 to $0.30, given the addition of the Orthovita and Memometal transactions. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Steve.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Thanks, Curt. In closing, we're pleased with our performance through the first 6 months of 2011, which reinforces our conviction and our ability to deliver on both the top and bottom line targets we set out at the start of the year. Importantly, our top line momentum accelerated in Q2 with all Reconstructive businesses achieving stronger sequential sales growth globally, while our MedSurg franchises remained a solid contributor to our top line growth targets and collectively delivered double-digit revenue gains. ", "Our newest franchise, Neurotechnology, is benefiting from key new product launches. Combined, these performances drove both the year-over-year and sequential uptick in our U.S., international and global sales growth. And we are making significant investments in R&D as evidenced by the 22% increase year-to-date on top of the 17% uptick in 2010, resulting in a steady stream of new product launches across all our franchises, many of which we highlighted at our recent May Analyst Meeting. ", "We are leveraging our balance sheet to augment our organic growth through selective acquisitions that strengthen our core and allow us to maximize the strength of our diverse sales footprint with its considerable distribution capabilities. Along with buybacks and dividends, we will continue to follow a 3-pronged cash strategy in order to maximize shareholder return. ", "With that, we'll now open it up for Q&A. Back to you, Derek.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question is coming from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Let me ask couple of questions, maybe Curt can start off. The gross margin line is probably going to get the most attention coming out of the quarter because it was lower than people thought, and you're adjusting your gross margin commentary for the year. I guess the part that we'd like to spend more of the time on is just the FX impact because the dollar -- if we look at where the dollar was versus euro and yen, at the time of your first quarter call to where it is now, hasn't moved that much to maybe change how we would be thinking about the impact over the balance of the year. So I was hoping you could spend a minute on that. And then second, maybe you can just talk about the impact of mix, particularly the strength in the beds business with this quarter and how that might have impacted your mix?", "Curt Hartman", "So 2 responses there, Mike. First of all, it's really the currency movements from both the fourth quarter and the first quarter relative to the second quarter because it takes time for the inventory to move through our system, especially when you look at the Reconstructive line, which has most of its manufacturing in the European market, euro-based and that has slower turns generally in a 7 to 9-month timeframe. When you look at mix, given that the Medical segment did have strong growth, certainly, that will contribute a little bit. But I will tell you on a relative dollar basis, the Medical segment, as a percentage of total sales, is probably not big enough to meaningfully move the gross margins on a full year basis.", "Michael Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Let me just follow up with one additional question, and that's on MedSurg because people are going to look at the first quarter performance and this quarter's performance and see a fair amount of volatility between the different divisions within MedSurg. So can you just talk about really all 3 and the way we sort of look at the instruments, endo and beds? Beds had a phenomenal quarter this quarter, but people always been nervous about that. And then instruments and endo had great first quarters, but slower this quarter, so what do you think is a steady state growth profile of those 3 businesses?", "Curt Hartman", "I don't think we're going to offer forward-looking comment on the growth profiles. I think, if you think about Stryker Medical, I tried to include in my commentary that the replacement market is where we're seeing the biggest influence from a growth standpoint, and that market feels pretty robust as evident by the trends we saw in the first half of the year. I don't think we see anything that's going to meaningfully slow that down from a market standpoint. Certainly, our business has to execute on that front. To your point, the endoscopy and instruments segments did slow down second quarter versus first, but I think we feel pretty good about both of those as we look through the second half of the year given product lineups, given the introduction of new products into those businesses across multiple areas. All of that said, there are still capital businesses. There are purchase cycles that we're working through. And if you look specifically at MedSurg and the instrument segment, the third quarter is their toughest comparable, so that makes slowly year-over-year comparables just a little bit. I think the fundamentals there are still pretty respectable, and we feel good about MedSurg as a category in whole as we look at this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "Just following up on the topic you were just talking about MedSurg. Curt or Steve, if you could expand a little bit on -- you talk about replacements being the driver there. How much of this is the ability for you to purchase market differently now that you have Gaymar on board? Is that having an impact? Or if you can maybe step back and give us a sense of -- if you're growing 27% x acquisitions and currency, what do you think the market's growing?", "Stephen MacMillan", "The market there is a tough one to predict until our other friends report. But having said that, I think we do -- we thought the Gaymar acquisition was a great acquisition right in our wheelhouse. It does help us probably more on the margin, Matt. I would say probably the overall market is just a little more robust right now.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "And any sense that this Q2 result is sort of -- are we pulling anything? You mentioned tougher comps in Q3, but are we pulling anything out of Q3? Is there any concern?", "Stephen MacMillan", "No, absolutely not.", "Matthew Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies", "That's helpful. And then one follow-up on Spine, just not -- 4% constant currency worldwide isn't, I guess, historically, a phenomenal number, but it's certainly better than we were expecting. Just if you could talk about what's been working in Spine. You gave us a sense of what some of the new products are that are coming, maybe talk about what some of the drivers were in the quarter.", "Katherine Owen", "I think you characterized it well, Matt. I think we're seeing stability to gradual improvement. So some of the trends that have turned negative very quickly 12, 18 months ago have been stable, and we've been retooling and refocusing that organization, certainly not ready to jump up and say \"We're back to where we want to be\", but just modest sequential improvement driven by some of the new products and just learning how to better navigate through the current market challenges. So not out of the woods yet, but we do feel that we're clearly at a point of stability to a slightly improving backdrop. And certainly, the Orthovita acquisition will be a nice focus for that group, given it's also very much in their core.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung from Sanford and Bernstein (sic) [Sanford Bernstein].", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "I wanted to go back to guidance here. So you talked -- you touched on gross margins. It looks like, though, the tax rate that you sort of put forth is an improvement over -- so your thinking at the beginning of the year, and then also constant currency -- also the currency benefited up. So is the right way to think of this that the gross margin offsets the benefits that you're getting from both currency and the lower tax rate as we move forward?", "Curt Hartman", "I think, clearly, when we -- if we go back to the beginning of the year and we put out some general guidance on where we thought various elements of the P&L would be through 6 months, gross margins a little bit lower, which obviously is a negative impact. But conversely, the tax rate, we believe, has downward bias. And that's probably driven by the mix of where products are manufactured and the geographic tax rate should apply in those markets. I think what we've tried to imply over time on currency is that it's not as easy as looking at the top line currency influence as a straight one for one drop-through there, just many elements in the P&L for the currency and the top line, and you also lose it when you convert those currencies into U.S. dollars and look at the costs some of our U.S. divisions take because of that currency conversion. So I think I would just try to keep gross margin and tax rate as perhaps, one offsetting the other to keep it as simple as possible.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., Inc.", "Okay, Curt. And on pricing, your overall pricing pressure with the company that the total was down 50 basis points as you pointed out. You said that sort of the general trend still remain the same, but I was wondering if you could give a little color as to where, at least on a sequential basis, we're seeing that improvement in pricing? And if your commentary implies that you think this is sort of a one-time issue or just any additional color on that pricing that you put out would be helpful.", "Katherine Owen", "I think you characterized it correctly. It improved 50 basis points, although still down 1.5% in the second quarter, which we would characterize within the normal realm. So I wouldn't point out and say we've seen some big reversal. Hip and Knee pricing remains negative, maybe modestly better sequentially and offset partly by mix with a little bit bigger on the mix side on the Hips, given some of the launches. But overall, none of these trends we would call out as outside what we've been seeing. So certainly better than it getting worse, but within the norm that we have been modeling.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Curt, not to have a whole run on MedSurg here this afternoon, but going back to this issue of sustainability of that growth, you're talking about the fundamentals and taking sort of the cap cycle recoveries out of the mix for a second, I wonder if you could talk about specific emerging market trends impacting MedSurg? Or is this replacement cycle that you're seeing? Is this a frame cycle or is this a surface cycle? Because I'm wondering if perhaps, actions to reduce hospital-acquired infections are driving an increase in demand for services and perhaps that is the way that we're seeing right now. So maybe any other granularity you can provide on either surfaces versus frames or an emerging markets will be helpful.", "Curt Hartman", "Well I would -- probably I'm not going to get to quite to the level of detail you want me to go to, David. But I would certainly hope that any members of our selling organization that are listening would be willing to step up and say we're selling both surfaces and frames given the Gaymar acquisition. In discussion, in review of our business with the folks in our medical entity, the replacement cycle they view as a function of two things: Number one, selling organization focus on both the patient handling and patient transport, but as well as on the pure bed side. We've got selling organizations now very focused on those, and I think you couple it with exactly what you said, which is there are some drivers from a reimbursement standpoint that talk about never events, be it hospital-acquired infection, be it false, that our technology facilitates very well the elimination of those never events. So I think it's part of clinical story, but it's also part of focus story. And then certainly, the fundamentals of the market are probably better today and have improved every quarter since the bottom in 2009. So I think it's a combination of right product, right selling organization and certainly, some right market dynamics that are helping out here.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And then, Curt, just one quick question on Knees. Just in the interest of setting expectations sort of appropriately as it relates to custom needs coming back in the back half of the year. Hips kind of performed as many would have expected this quarter, Knees did not. How important is getting customer in the back half going to be to performance? What I'm trying to drive it is, which is challenging, trying to separate out the external factors versus the internal factors, and how we should be thinking about sizing the relative improvement with the new products on the market?", "Stephen MacMillan", "David, it's Steve here. I would -- I tell you I think the shape fitting is a big deal to us. Having said that, in terms of its ramp, the ramp will be a little slower obviously, but we are rolling out OtisMed right now. Cases are being held. The sales force have been trained on proper labeling and all of that kind of stuff. But I think it was starting to hurt us by not having a custom fit option. And we were probably on the verge of frankly, truthfully, we were starting to lose some surgeons where they love to Triathlon, but frankly, just got finally tired of waiting for us. And we were probably right at that breaking point here in the first and second quarter after the academy when we didn't have it. A few docs, I think, have held on long enough and kind of say, \"Okay, enough is enough. I'm going to go use somebody else's product.\" So now it's a question of getting those back. We feel good that we will. But as you know, in this business, the docs don't come back to you day one, but I think we will. I would suspect we were going to be starting to see an uptick here in the third quarter absolutely, but it'll be, again, probably a little bit more that freight train getting back in gear.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Two questions. One, can you talk about the Trauma and Extremities market? It looks like you had a nice little pickup there in your sales. And then second of all, if my memory serves right, you have a 3-year compliance program that's rolling off at the end of this year. What is your current thinking about that?", "Curt Hartman", "In Trauma, we did see a little bit of a pickup. I think it's part organizational focus and probably part organizational enthusiasm around the Extremities acquisition. I don't think any of us are jumping up and down about our second quarter Trauma results. We think there's better days ahead given the acquisition emphasis here on the Extremities piece and more work that's being done from an innovation standpoint. So a nice, a decent respectable quarter, but we think there's more to do there. Relative to the compliance and it really relates to the 3-year investment that we've laid out. That starts rolling off in the second half of this year or the project, the focus, the journey, whatever you want to call it, formally comes to an end. But the reality is when you look at the acquisition track we have been on and the facilities that, that brings, there's plenty of acquisition, integration from a quality compliance system standpoint to keep us very busy. And there's the one-time events in the quality journey that probably come and gone. But there is a new level of base spend that is in our cost structure. And really what we hope to see in the years ahead is the benefit of that quality infrastructure starting to play out in terms of lower scrap rates, lower labor variants, lower warranty return rates. It's far too soon to see any of that showing up in the P&L right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Wittes from Caris & Company.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company", "So just some follow-up question. First off, in terms of OtisMed, you're obviously implying that this has become a lot more important in the last, say, 6 months since the market has sort of gotten used to the contest with some of your competitors out there. I guess I want to know your opinion in terms of what percentage of the market is really going to think to use it right now. And I think what's the ultimate potential because the way you're talking it sounds like the majority of doctors are thinking about converting over to this type of approach?", "Katherine Owen", "Jason, I'll take the first question. It's tough to know, obviously, ultimately, how much penetration shape matching will have. Some of the data we've seen is maybe around 10% of Knees. We think it has the potential to go higher, but a lot of that will be longer-term multiyear in nature as there's more clinical data produced that validates many of the benefits that clinicians believe they're seeing: Shorter procedure time, better consistency, improved outcomes. But that there is not yet a pool of data to support definitively. And that's probably what will be needed over the next few years to really drive the broader market acceptance. So we think the trend is going to continue upwards, over what time frame and to what magnitude, probably it's too speculative to call out, but we do think there's a nice opportunity for clinical data to help drive some of that adoption.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company", "Okay. And similarly, if I look at your Hip number, you did provide some color, but I'm curious is most of the growth that we saw mix-related? Or do you think you're winning back competitive accounts this quarter?", "Katherine Owen", "A little tough to know until we see everybody's new numbers come in. But we do feel that having a product that -- the combined offering ADM and MDM in the large head segment in the market is -- it's a nice alternative, and it obviously gets us into a segment of the market that we weren't in previously. So obviously, the hope would be we gain market share. That's the expectation with the product launches, but really couldn't say definitively until we see everybody's numbers coming in.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Just 2 quick ones. First, on the OtisMed side, other companies have suggested that their products of a similar look are able to gather maybe $1,000 to $1,500 price tag per procedure. And I was just wondering is there any reason why pricing of your shape fitting technology would be materially different from what we're seeing in the marketplace from other competitors?", "Katherine Owen", "I don't think so.", "Robert Hopkins - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then on the bed side, I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around a 27% growth rate for that business, x FX and M&A. And I know you're in the sweet spot of a lot of nice trends here. But just from a big picture perspective, are you guys confident that this is a cycle with real legs here? Is this something that you think can continue for a while? I just would love some big picture thoughts on that division. I know we've talked about it a lot already, but just want some big picture thoughts.", "Stephen MacMillan", "Sure, Bob. To get your head around the number, you just have to meet our sales force. Come to one of our sales meetings, so that wouldn't quite work, but that would give you the confidence as to how they're doing it. Having said that, this number, we have to tell you, it shocked us too. Let's be honest, we don't have quarters like this very often, but we do think a sustainable rate -- right now medical's in a pretty good cycle. Is it going to be another 27%, 37% kind of quarter? We don't -- can't possibly forecast anything like that. But the order's trends have been pretty good right now. And I think we feel over the course of this year, medical's going to be one of those businesses that delivers more revenue in 2011 than we expected at the start of the year to offset some of the others that won't. But we'll have to kind of continue to see where it goes. But we still feel good about the long-term fundamentals of that business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "Two questions. First on the revenue guidance. You maintained organic constant currency of 5% to 7%, but you actually had a better-than-expected underlying quarter, and we're now adding Orthovita and Memometal into the numbers. So I'm curious why you didn't take that number up a little bit? Is it just conservatism? Or is there's something other than the macro that you're concerned about? And that's question one. And then, Curt, just one question on the gross margin. We've talked about it on the call, but down 100 basis points. Can you quantify or elaborate what part of that down 100 basis points relative to consensus was FX?", "Katherine Owen", "I'll take the first part of the question. A couple of points. I think most of you on the call know us well enough, we tend to outline commitments that we're fully committed to hitting on at the start of the year. We are midway through the year. It's still some markets are challenging, and although those acquisitions obviously are additive, they'll have a 6-month contribution, also keep in size to the relative side. So it's still is consistent with the addition of those into our total targeted range. To be fair, it does, obviously, increase our conviction in the higher end to the degree that those are additive. But overall, the range -- it doesn't materially impact that range.", "Curt Hartman", "Glenn, on the second question, probably I'm not going to get into the minutia there and break down the decrease relative to people's model. Suffice it to say, it's a combination of pricing, currency that all influenced the ultimate gross margin, and they all contributed in the quarter. So hopefully, what we've tried to do here is restate our outlook for the second half to get people a sense of where we think things are going to finish as we look at what's in front of us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities USA.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "I was just wondering with regard to Orthovita, where that revenue will be recorded. Is it going to be split kind of between Spine and I guess, Instruments for the vertebroplasty portion? And are you maintaining their sales force that they had?", "Curt Hartman", "So a couple of questions there. The revenue will be split. You'll have the Vitoss product, which is carried principally by our Spine-selling organization. You have the Vitagel product, which will be carried by a combination of selling organizations, both part of our Reconstructive group and part of our MedSurg Group, and then the CORTOSS item will be carried by our Interventional Spine group, which as a reminder, is now reported publicly in the Spine and Neurotech segment. So if you divide all that up, you'll see the biggest segment of it in the Spine and Neurotech public reporting and then a smaller slice in both MedSurg and Reconstructive. And obviously, we're just 2 days remaining in the second quarter, we closed a transaction. We're in the process of integrating that organization, and that's inclusive of their U.S. selling effort.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay. And then, I just have a second question. In your Hip business, I remember maybe it was a year or 2 ago, you launched a modular stem, I believe it's called Rejuvenate. I haven't heard you all talk a lot about that really recently. Is modular net stem still an opportunity for you guys? And how is that particular product doing?", "Katherine Owen", "I would say it's part of that portfolio of Hip products. I wouldn't call it out specifically as having a major impact, but then again, as you know, that's generally true for the entirety of our portfolio, more kind of in net singles and doubles. So it's just a part of the product offering to be able to have a comprehensive portfolio for those doctors that want a modular offering. But beyond that, I wouldn't get into any specifics about how that individual product was faring.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Curt, I was hoping you could just clarify from your prepared remarks, you mentioned that there was the moving parts with respect to where certain items were accounted for in the P&L. Can you just remind us of what those were? And also, can you quantify the impact of some of the charges that increased G&A in the quarter?", "Curt Hartman", "So, David, the first thing I'd probably do is correct the statement. There is no question in my mind whatsoever. We have accounted for everything in our P&L exactly the way it should be accounted for. What my comments were is that in the presentation of the second quarter P&L, I think it's a fair statement to say it probably doesn't line up with any of the models that anybody created. And that starts at the gross margin level and probably goes all the way down to the tax rate inclusive of G&A being higher than people probably model because of the IP legal settlement that we settled in the quarter. And then, you had some tax controversy that settled and part of the settlement of tax controversy is you unwind accruals and all the interest that built up on those accruals can come back through the interest expense line. And that's where you saw interest expense actually be a positive this quarter versus the traditional negative that interest expense is. So I think the way I would summarize is we had lower gross margin, really attributable to some of the manufacturing and how currency moves through there. We had higher G&A associated with an IP settlement. We had better than probably modeled interest and other income because of that reversal of tax interest. And then, we had a lower tax rate, which is really driven by the mix of products and where they're geographically manufactured. So that's how I would package all of that.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, Steve, maybe a follow-up on your comment regarding the OtisMed rollout. And obviously, we understand that there's a training element with surgeons, and I think other products that peers have launched have taken anywhere from 6 to 12 months before you started to see a material impact. Have you seen accounts where custom cutting blocks have been adopted? Have you lost just certain business in those accounts? Or there -- have you lost full accounts? And this is really an effort to regain those lost accounts or is this more gaining back parts of accounts that you might have lost certain pieces of business in?", "Stephen MacMillan", "In most cases, it's gaining back parts. So it's a doctor might have been using both hips and knees and got tired and wanted to use somebody else's knee. And I would say that was really just starting to happen in the second quarter. So it'll be more, I think, bringing -- turbocharging a lot of our existing surgeons, and then inching away and getting some competitive ones along the way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays Capital.", "Matthew Taylor", "I just wanted to tick and tie a couple of smaller points here. If you can comment a little bit on the Ascent acquisition, how that's trending. I don't think we've talked about that yet.", "Curt Hartman", "Second quarter, Stryker Sustainability Solutions business had a better quarter than the first quarter. I think we commented after the first quarter or some competitive markets responses, not surprisingly. But directionally, we feel good about the trend that we saw in the second quarter relative to the first quarter. And I think, overall, we remain very high in our conviction that this is the right business for Stryker and for the market and that longer term, we see very favorable trends here. Further, you think about these smaller businesses that are acquired, there is a period of integration and every time you go through integration, there are stumbles or challenges that perhaps disrupt the business model. And we've got to work our way to the other side and we feel good about the progress we're making there. So directionally, better second quarter than we saw in the first quarter. Back kind of got the nose of the plane pointed up and going in the right direction at this point, and it was a positive contributor, so we feel good about it.", "Matthew Taylor", "Okay. And then, I guess, looking for a similar update on the Neurovascular acquisition, you had stated previously a goal to get to market growth. You're probably still a little bit below that, but new products could help. Can you give us an update there?", "Curt Hartman", "We feel very good about where the Neurovascular business is at the halfway mark. We commented in the first quarter that we saw positive growth in the U.S. market. That remains true in the second quarter and through the first half of the year. And sequentially, it built on the first quarter and then in my prepared comments, I noted that in the international markets based on the strength of the target rollout, that we had recorded a positive quarter. So all in, the business, on a global basis, was positive. We like where the new products are taking us. We like the stickiness with customers who have used the products. All of that said, there are some market challenges in the Neurovascular space today, given things like Brazil and reimbursement cut that I mentioned in the first quarter. That's still to be sorted out, hopefully some time in the second half of this year. So like any business, it has its headwind, but generally on track with the direction and pleased with it through the first 6 months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien from William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "I was just hoping that you could talk a little bit about the Extremities market there with your acquisition of Memometal. What are your plans as far as expanding your sales force there or potentially breaking out and having a focused sales group focus primarily on that segment of the market? And then are there other products that you're planning to bring through, potentially, a new shoulder system to augment your portfolio at this time?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. I guess a couple of comments. Very excited about this product offering because it really gives us access to a specialty customer and with a lot of the podiatric surgeons performing these foot and ankle procedures. You combine that with their proprietary technology and manufacturing know-how. We think it's a very nice fit. We will be able to make investments in the sales force to a much greater degree than they were given just the relative size, and so it will be an area of investment. We think there are opportunities to pull through other products, nothing that we would speak to specifically. Part of what we liked here was what we have on the market, and part of what we liked was the pipeline of products that's generally consistent with what you've seen in our other businesses, singles and doubles, that in totality, really worked to move the needle. So it's an exciting market given the growth potential. And we think this acquisition specifically helped us tap into a customer segment that is really not an area we have historically called on.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Okay. And then the second question on the biologic side with the Orthovita acquisition. Can you just talk a little bit about where your utilization was with your biologic portfolio before the Orthovita deal in terms of all the spine cases, spinal fusion cases you were involved with? And then where you think that may go over the next 6 months or a couple of years even with that broad portfolio available to you now?", "Katherine Owen", "I would view that the acquisition is very similar in that if we're going to leverage the product offering that we got with the Orthovita deal through our much broader distribution channels in both inpatient and outpatient and across multiple divisions, Instruments, Spine, as was mentioned earlier. I wouldn't view this as leveraging the revenue that we were generating within our biotech specifically. This is where we're rounding out our product portfolio where there was a gap and, again, focusing on our core and leveraging the distribution capability that we have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "Just a couple actually, probably short ones. Just looking at the organic growth rate this quarter versus last, it picked up. I'm just interested if there's any differences in selling days this quarter relative to what we saw in 1Q on a year-to-year basis? The pricing dynamics, overall, looked better. How much of that was just anniversarying of Japan? Was that most of the difference if we look at 1Q versus 2Q? And then any additional color just kind of on the incremental acquisition and integration charges, and should we expect those to continue as we just look ahead or will those just be a 2011 phenomenon?", "Curt Hartman", "Kristen, on the days, the days were effectively the same as they were in the prior quarter a year ago. On the pricing, do not have anything material coming out of the sunsetting of Japan that influenced the general pricing in the quarter. Certainly, the sunsetting helps a little bit in the Japan market, but total company influence was insignificant there. And your last question, I believe, was on the acquisition charges. We updated -- I tried to update at the end of my prepared comments the full year expectation for acquisition and integration-related charges given the addition of new Orthovita closing here at the last couple days of the second quarter. So I may not be fully understanding that question.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "I guess just what -- is it just all inventory step-up charges? And it's a pretty big number, and should we continue to expect that there'll be some residual integration related to all these deals flowing into next year?", "Curt Hartman", "Okay. So the first half of the year, the biggest component of the number was Neurovascular inventory step-up charges. That is far and away the lion's share of the number. Other charges related to acquisition and integration are truly those one-time costs, anything from perhaps banker fees to the use of consultants as you're going through the integration from a systems approach, things like that. So if you take what we said the charge would be for the full year, subtract what we've already recorded, that kind of gives you the idea of what's left. As we head into 2012, I would expect the call outs here would be minimal at best.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG", "And then I guess, everyone's kind of been asking in a different way, but can you specifically break out the litigation that was in the SG&A line, just so people can get a -- so we can all understand a little bit better what the ongoing kind of number was and to what degree there was that impact just related to tax and other?", "Curt Hartman", "I'm not going to give you a specific number. I would just refer people to look at the prepared comments. The -- I believe I said that in the Other income and expense, that change effectively equalized the IP settlement. And I think if you look at the charges we usually record in Other income, you'll be able to back your way into what that relative number may have been.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Leerink Swann.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Back to Hips briefly, Steve, you highlighted seeing the sort of early signs of the positive impact of the new product launches. And I think you saw another one to launch maybe the Accolade II maybe this year or early next year. You've talked about the sort of the train and the slow-moving momentum. Is the momentum here now? And we should expect that year-over-year rate of growth to continue to pick up from here based on what we know about the markets, how you're thinking about that?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes, I think, Rick, clearly the MDM is getting some nice momentum, and I think it's building, I mean, frankly, we've been almost a little bit of supply-constrained on this one because we didn't overbuild inventory on this one. But it is building nicely. And I think it's going to be -- it is that train building. Accolade, probably by the way, we're going to -- even though we mentioned it at the Analyst Meeting, we'll probably end up pushing it back into next year, just to time [ph] the expectation because frankly, with OtisMed approval and all the momentum on MDM, we feel so good about the second half of this year. But that'll be -- that'll give us more news for next year. So I think that's why we feel really good as we look at the Hip pipeline over the next 18, 24 months. I agree we feel very good about seeing sequential build not just this year, but through next year as well. But it's not a ramp like our Medical business, as you know.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Great. But maybe back to the mid- to upper single digits in the second half, it doesn't sound unreasonable.", "Stephen MacMillan", "A lot of that -- we're still leered at over communicate numbers given we're not sure exactly what the total volume of the market will be. I think we'll be taking share and feel good about that.", "Frederick Wise - Leerink Swann LLC", "Okay. And maybe just lastly a couple of bigger picture questions, just one, any updated thoughts on your European business just given the debt crisis and various concerns there? And last, you've had a very rapid pace of acquisitions over the last 12 months or so. Should we expect that same -- that pace to continue? I appreciate all subject to negotiation, but are you as intensively at work on adding the portfolio now as you were a year ago or say?", "Katherine Owen", "We are probably going to refrain from any specifics about whether the acquisition activity is going to be at the same pace, higher or lower. It's just the very nature of BD is such that it's going to ebb and flow and maybe following a period of a lot of activity, it ebbs a little bit more. But you never know in terms of -- there could be a strategic decision to make an acquisition and wouldn't want to have comments that could prove to be correct or incorrect down the road -- prove to be incorrect down the road. So a long winded way of saying probably not going to make a comment beyond reiterating. We've got a strategy for the 3-pronged use of cash, and M&A is part of that, but it will be more or less active at different periods of time.", "Stephen MacMillan", "And on the Europe piece, Rick, I think we feel really good about the -- our leadership over there right now. We've been reining in a lot of old product lines and dealing with a lot of things in fighting through a pretty tough market. I think we look at Europe right now and say it's a very low-growth market. And we're slugging it out and fighting through it. So I think we've stopped the bleeding there and on the way back, but we've also still got some stuff we can do better.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer & Co.", "Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Just on gross margin, we've gone through the near-term movements with currency. I was wondering if you could talk to the progress you're seeing being made by Lonny Carpenter in his efforts to streamline the manufacturing process overall?", "Curt Hartman", "Certainly, a big area of focus for the company and a lot of work going on, I think you have to keep in mind that anything revolving around manufacturing, product changes, product consolidations, the first approach is understanding what it does or how it influences the quality system that we worked so hard as a company to build and instill. So there -- almost in a sense, first, do no harm as we look at the opportunities. These opportunities are evident. There are project teams lining up and they are sorting through the priorities. And keep it in mind that some of these projects, the majority of the projects will take an investment to get them off the ground and get the long-term leverage. I would, however, as an early indicator point to perhaps, our tax rate as an indicator of some of the changes. As we've moved some of our manufacturing, it does have influence across the entirety of the P&L, including the tax rate. And just as a reminder, we made some changes with some of our Europe -- with one of our Europe plants last year, move some of that production into a different geography that has a better tax rate.", "Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "Okay, Curt. And just on Japan, were there any surprises in terms of the impact of the earthquake and tsunami as you went through 2Q? I'm guessing it wasn't material, overall, but were any segments impacted more than others and have things sort of normalized at this point?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Yes. Actually Japan, was probably one of our bigger upside surprises in the quarter. Our Japan business did very, very well, and pretty much across the board, but especially the Reconstructive. Hips and Knees were very healthy there. It's probably one of our, believe it or not, best regions in the world.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Plovanic from Canaccord.", "William Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity", "Just 2 clarification questions. One, I think for gross margin, you said there's about a one-time charge of about $55 million pretax. What was that number for SG&A? And then also, as you look at Q3 and Q4 for the one-time charges, I know you gave us an earnings impact, but how much of that do you think will fall in Q3, how much in Q4? And then I think you said that most of it will flow through the G&A, and I just want to get clarification there.", "Curt Hartman", "In the quarter, it was about $9 million, rough numbers. And then, we didn't break it out between third and fourth quarter. And honestly, Bill, I don't have that in front of me right now off the top of my head.", "William Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity", "Okay. And then lastly, just on the Orthovita, I think you said that -- when you said CORTOSS is in Neurotech and Spine, is that more of the Neuro piece or the Spine piece?", "Curt Hartman", "No. What I said is CORTOSS is distributed by our Interventional Spine organization, which from a public reporting standpoint, used to be included in the Instruments segment. And beginning this year, when we created the new segments, we moved that over to report it under the Neurotech and Spine segment.", "Katherine Owen", "It would be specifically in the Spine of the Neurotech and Spine.", "Curt Hartman", "Sorry, specifically within Spine of the Neurotech.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank", "Just maybe a quick one R&D. The company has aggressively increased R&D investment in recent quarters including this one. I'm just wondering if you could comment on what you might see as a sustainable steady-state level of spending given the current mix of businesses and given the regulatory environment?", "Katherine Owen", "We haven't called out long-term targets specifically. We have said to assume that R&D is generally in that 5% to 6% range of sales, and you've seen it trend upward this year. So I think for near-term modeling, 2011, that remains a big assumption.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank", "If I could just follow-up, do you see this as a line that's going to consistently grow faster than revs? Or is this potentially going to moderate understanding there is an impact of an acquisition in there currently, obviously?", "Stephen MacMillan", "Clearly, it's a little bit inflated this year by the acquisition. Having said that, as we said, we grew R&D 17% last year. I think as long as we continue to feel good about the products in the pipeline, that line may grow faster than sales.", "Operator", "And your final question is coming from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Curt, I'm wondering if I could just ask one last clarifying question around gross margin. And maybe I missed it last quarter, but I remember on the fourth quarter call, you talked about gross margins expecting them to be up a little bit from the 2010 level of 68.8%. Did you formally update that last quarter? Is the next formal update just coming this quarter?", "Curt Hartman", "No, this quarter is the update.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay, and so I guess I understand what you're saying the U.S. dollar obviously has been weaker since the fourth quarter when you really last addressed that and that all makes sense. Obviously, orthopedic implants probably a little softer here than any of us would have thought in the second half. Recovery maybe not going to be as robust and MedSurg has been stronger. Is there anything else going on besides those 3 things? Any of the deals you've done now maybe being more margin dilutive, gross margin dilutive than any of us might realize or anything else in there? Is it really just those 3 factors changing from the fourth quarter guidance [indiscernible] ?", "Curt Hartman", "There are no other factors. I think I understand the confusion. It's just part of the complexity of the manufacturing network. When currency moves, it's not only the cost of the underlying currency. It's the inventory excess and obsolete charges and how those dollars are restated in the U.S.-based P&L. So there's -- you got to think about it in broad terms of how these currency movements impact the entirety of the P&L, and they're not insignificant movements. So that said, we do have some things that helped hedge that a little bit with the way we're set up. But it's not appropriate model by any stretch, and there's going to be movements as currency and as inventory turns change.", "Jeffrey Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Yes. No, I understood. There's just nothing else hanging out in there, I guess, is all I'm trying to confirm here.", "Stephen MacMillan", "No, Jeff. And I want to clarify that as well, because clearly, it's not anything from the acquisitions. What I'd also say is Curt and his team are really doing a much better job, I'd say, than what we had historically in terms of understanding swings in gross margin because of all the various lag effects in the inventory. And when you go back and look historically, I think second and third quarters last year, we probably got even more of a benefit from the FX than we had fully maybe grasped at the time. If you recall, we were surprised by the gross margin. And I think it probably was more driven FX, and it's a bigger headwind this year than what we had fully grasped.", "All right, and thank you, Derek. I think we'll wrap up on that, and so that everybody knows, the conference call for our third quarter results will be held on exactly 3 months from today, October 19, 2011. Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Please go ahead, sir.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Thank you, Regina. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2011 earnings report. With me today are Curt Hartman, our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Similar to prior calls, I will make some comments before turning the call over to Katherine and Curt for more details before opening up the call to your questions. ", "As we look back on our financial results for 2011, both for fourth quarter and the year, we were encouraged on multiple fronts while remaining cognizant of the current economic environment. Our results again demonstrate that our balanced diversification uniquely positions us to steadily deliver top-tier results. Against that backdrop, we would like to touch on several key highlights from the quarter and the year. ", "We completed 2011 with over $8.3 billion in sales, up 13% on a reported basis and reflecting mid-single digit organic growth, augmented by the benefit from a series of key strategic acquisitions as well as a currency tailwind. Our adjusted EPS came in at $3.72, up 12% and at the high end of the guidance we put forth at the start of the year or adjusted per-share earnings of $3.65 to $3.73. This came despite absorbing additional dilution associated with several acquisitions and the recently announced Biotech settlement. ", "With 11% constant currency sales growth, our MedSurg segment once again demonstrated the tremendous strength of their product portfolio, customer relationships and ability to drive ongoing market share gains. We head into 2012 with strong momentum, a compelling lineup of new products and a high degree of conviction regarding our ability to continue to deliver strong growth in these businesses.", "Shifting to Neurotechnology and Spine, although challenges remain within our Spine franchise, the new product launches for our Neurovascular segment continue to gain traction, resulting in better-than-expected results for a business that we acquired at the start of 2011. And with the acquisition of Concentric in early Q4, we have expanded our stroke presence into the ischemic segment, allowing Stryker to be uniquely positioned with a market-leading total stroke product offering in this high growth and highly innovative segment of med tech. ", "In addition to Neurovascular and Concentric, we utilized our strong cash flow to execute on our strategy of strengthening our core businesses via targeted acquisitions. This was evident with the acquisition of Memometal, which broadens our offering in the high-growth extremities space, as well as Orthovita, which we are leveraging across multiple Stryker franchises. ", "Similar to the Gaymar and Sonopet deals that we did in 2010, we are pleased with the performance of all these targets and excited about their ability to both drive stronger core sales growth going forward while also providing important operating leverage as we drive greater sales through our existing teams.", "During 2011, we further clarified and strengthened our capital allocation strategy and view it as an important competitive strength to continue to maximize shareholder value. While we believe highly focused acquisitions are the best use of our cash flow, we remain committed to our three-pronged cash strategy, which also includes dividends and share repurchases. Despite our robust activity over the last couple of years, we enter 2012 with a net cash position of over $1.6 billion, so our balance sheet remains an important competitive strength for 2012 and beyond.", "Although our Reconstructive implant growth slowed sequentially, reflecting the anticipated impact of difficult year-over-year comparisons and one less selling day, we are encouraged by the ramp in our MDM large head hip offering as well as the traction that our customized cutting guides are now seeing within knees. While we conservatively assume no improvement in elective procedure trends in 2012, we believe that share gains in hips and knees are achievable. And if the economic environment and/or the degenerative nature of osteoarthritis results in a stronger rebounded implant procedures, we are well positioned to capitalize on the volumes.", "On a geographic basis, we achieved balanced growth with our U.S. sales up 9% in the quarter and constant currency international gains coming in at 13%. Although challenges remain within our European business, we are seeing strong double-digit growth in other geographies, including Canada as well as emerging markets, which is contributing to our overall strength. ", "Finally, while we are highly focused on delivering on our financial commitments and quarterly results, we did take actions in the fourth quarter that both strengthen our organization as well as position us for sustained longer-term growth. Specifically, during Q4, we announced a restructuring initiative, which is centered on quality, innovation and cost and reflects proactive actions to address the reality of our evolving healthcare markets. These moves are expected to reduce pretax operating costs by over $100 million starting in 2013 by providing efficiencies and realigning resources. We also expect the savings to help address the impact of the 2013 medical device excise tax, while supporting our commitment to delivering 10% or better EPS growth in 2012 and beyond.", "Simply put, 2011 was an extraordinarily busy year for both acquisitions and internal strengthening, which positions us well for 2012 and beyond while delivering in 2011. We believe the myriad actions undertaken over the past few years have positioned us to not only navigate the challenges, but also maximize the opportunities. Today, no single franchise represents more than 16% of our total sales, which affords us the ability to offset weakness in some areas while capitalizing on the better-than-anticipated momentum in other segments.", "We are committed to delivering organic sales growth at a minimum of 2% to 5% in 2012, which atop the contribution from acquisitions, positions us to achieve constant currency revenue gains of 3.5% to 6.5%. And while we continue to invest in internal innovation, sales and marketing as well as our ongoing quality initiatives, there's ample P&L leverage that will drive our stated goal of 10% or better EPS growth. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Steve. With the sluggish pace of the economic recovery, continued high unemployment and the lack of visibility surrounding a re-acceleration in elective surgeries, we have opted to assume a relatively conservative stance with respect to our 2012 top line growth targets. Against that backdrop, my comments today will focus on providing greater granularity regarding the key assumptions behind our targeted 2% to 5% sales growth excluding acquisitions and currencies and our outlook for the various markets. Curt will then provide specific details regarding some of the key assumptions in our 2012 EPS targets.", "Starting with Reconstructive. We approached our outlook for 2012 with the assumption that market growth rates for hip and knee implants remain sluggish and consistent with levels achieved in 2011. Although the degenerative nature of OA underscores our conviction that the current slowdown is a function of a temporary deferral in surgery, it is difficult to predict the timing as to when these patients will re-present. ", "With respect to decrease in unemployment rates, coupled with an acceleration in the pain associated with OA's downward disease cascade will be necessary to reverse these trends. In the interim, we are excited about the uptake of our recent hip launches, including our ADM and MDM large head offering, which continued to see quarter-over-quarter sequential acceleration and position adoption. On the knee front, our shape cutting technology is also gaining traction and we believe will help drive knee share gains in 2012. ", "Turning to MedSurg. Our sales guidance for 2012 assumes at least 5% revenue gains for this segment. Driving growth will be a combination of new product launches and the associated expected share gains. Specifically, our instrument segment initiated the early launch of its next-generation System 7 power tool in late 2011 with the full launch slated to get underway in 2012. As the market leader in power tools with a history of launching innovative next-generation products, System 7 underscores our commitment to leveraging our considerable R&D investments.", "System 7, which will be highlighted at the upcoming AAOS meeting, incorporates a number of key features and benefits including the smaller, lighter design with the torque, speed and power equivalent to the System 6. Coupled with an improved handpiece shape and grip as well as corrosion resistant coating, we are excited about its expected impact to our instruments division in 2012.", "Shifting to endoscopy. In the second half of 2012, we will launch our next-generation 1488 camera, which will offer improved visualization and enhanced image clarity, key components of ensuring optimal outcomes during smaller incision surgery. Medical, which continues to see solid market adoption of its expanded product offering and services by the 2010 Gaymar acquisition, will be introducing new products in 2012 within both the structures and cut [ph] segments. ", "Finally, Stryker Sustainability Solutions, which was established by our 2009 acquisition of Ascent, has benefited from accelerating top line growth, a trend that we expect will continue into 2012 and is being fueled by strengthening of a leadership team, additional product clearances as well as a continued recognition by the market of the economic and environmental merits associated with medical device reprocessing. ", "And lastly, Neurotechnology and Spine is also expected to deliver a minimum of 5% growth in 2012. Although the market backdrop in Spine remains challenging and our own segment has struggled in recent quarters, the introduction of new products, including the 2011 rollout of a lateral fusion offering, should help to stabilize the business. And with Orthovita contributing to core growth in H2 of this year, the Spine segment has expanded its portfolio into higher growth segments where our considerably expanded sales and distribution capabilities are being leveraged. ", "Looking at the Neurotechnology segment, which is dominated by our Neurovascular products, this segment will continue to benefit from product introductions in 2011 as well as additional offerings to be rolled out this year. The early Q4 2011 acquisition of Concentric expands our stroke franchise to include both hemorrhagic as well as the considerably larger ischemic segment, and we continue to anticipate a late 2012 or 2013 FDA clearance of Concentric's next-generation Trevo device. As we stated at the time of the acquisition of Neurovascular in late 2010, we believe we are well positioned to return at least to market growth rates in 2012 which we peg in the high single digits.", "In summary, although there are some challenges, the balanced diversification of our product portfolio, coupled with our expanded presence in higher growth segments of med tech via acquisitions and an attractive temple of new products, we believe we will be able to deliver a minimum of 2% to 5% sales growth in 2012. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Curt.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. In exiting 2011, we are pleased with our fourth quarter and full year performance and encouraged by the momentum we carry into the new year. Our financial discipline coupled with our expanding business mix, operational execution and continued focus on capital allocation have us well positioned. ", "In 2011, we again delivered adjusted per-share earnings at the high end of our original range, and absent the recent Biotech settlement, a subsequent event by accounting standards, we would have achieved at least $3.74 on an adjusted basis, a $0.01 above our original guidance. Additionally, 2011 has been another year of selective acquisitions that both increased our footprint and broadened our offering, while simultaneously we have focused on total shareholder returns through an increasing dividend yield and continued share repurchases.", "Moving to the fourth quarter, sales increased 11% on a reported basis and 10.7% in constant currency. Growth, excluding acquisitions and currency, was 4%. On the earnings side, in the quarter, we generated adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.02, an increase of 9.7% over Q4 of 2010. On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $1.05, an increase of 41.9% versus Q4 of 2010. Reconciliation, I would point you to our press release as we have provided a table that reconciles reported diluted net earnings and reported diluted net earnings per share to adjusted non-GAAP amounts. ", "In reviewing the quarter, I'll start with the discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, reported revenue growth of 11% was driven by volume and mix, which contributed 5.7% to our top line, while company-wide selling prices declined 1.7%, which is consistent with the trend we have seen in recent quarters. Acquisitions added 6.7%, and currency contributed approximately $7 million and improved the company's overall reported sales growth by approximately 30 basis points. For the year, the 13.5% reported gain was comprised of volume and mix, which contributed 6.1% to our top line growth, while company-wide selling prices declined 1.8%. Acquisitions added 6.8%, and currency contributed approximately $172 million and improved the company's reported 2011 sales growth by 2.3%.", "Looking at our reporting segments. Reconstructive products, which represented 44% of our sales in the quarter and includes our hip, knee, trauma and other reconstructive lines, recorded a 1.3% increase as reported and a 70 basis point increase in constant currency. Acquisition added 1.6%. Nice gains in our trauma business were not enough to offset slower performances in hips and knees. ", "At the segment level, hip sales recorded a 1% reported gain and increased 40 basis points in constant currency. Knee sales remained weak in the quarter, reporting a decline of roughly 2% both as reported and in constant currency. Globally, trauma had another nice quarter, delivering 9.1% reported growth and 8.2% growth in constant currency. Acquisitions added 5% to the trauma top line. ", "Overall, we entered 2011 recognizing that Q4 would likely be the toughest quarter for our hip and knee franchises given difficult year-over-year comparisons and the impact of one less selling day. That said, with the benefits from the organizational changes implemented during the year, as well as the continued positive market reaction to our new hip and knee product offerings, we feel good about our Reconstructive opportunities in 2012 in a market that remains challenged.", "Next, I'll turn to MedSurg, which represented 39% of sales in the quarter and is comprised of instruments, endoscopy, medical and the sustainability solutions segments. MedSurg delivered another strong quarter. Sales increased 11.2% as reported and 11.1% on a constant currency basis. Solid gains were recorded in all segments in both the U.S. and international markets. Acquisition impact in the quarter was immaterial to top line results. Once again, the medical segment was very strong, delivering 17% reported growth, 17.4% in constant currency. ", "The U.S. medical results at almost 16% in the quarter remain impressive and make it 7 of the last 8 quarters recording over double-digit growth. While on the international markets, we are pleased to see our second consecutive double-digit quarter.", "Instruments also performed well in the quarter, and we are encouraged by the earlier release and favorable uptake of our next-generation System 7 power tool platform, which represents an important new product offering for the division. Endoscopy reported a nice uptick in the quarter, but will likely face headwinds in the first half of 2012 as we go against the tough Q1 comparable and work through the timing associated with new product introduction cycles. ", "Finally, our sustainability solutions segment delivered a second straight high-growth quarter with our team really performing well in the second half of 2011. All in, it was a great quarter and year for MedSurg. We are highly encouraged by the momentum they carry into 2012.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represented 17% of company sales in the quarter, increased 47.3% as reported and 46.8% on a constant currency basis. Acquisitions added 45.1% to the constant currency increase. While we experienced strong organic growth from our Interventional Spine and NSE offerings, as well as the positive influence of the various acquisitions, this was largely offset by continued pressure on the spinal implant market in terms of both price and volumes.", "I will now turn to income statement, beginning with our gross margin performance. Gross margins as reported finished at 66.6%. On an adjusted basis, gross margins, excluding acquisition-related charges, were 67.3% in the quarter, down 140 basis points versus prior year. Factors influencing margins in the quarter included a 50 basis point hit associated with the previously mentioned pricing pressure and approximately 70 basis points of erosion associated with our quarterly sales mix and the decision to slow our manufacturing plants to better align inventory levels. Investments directed and initiated in our global manufacturing alignment also suppressed margin performance. Finally, while still negative, the influence of currency moderated in the quarter relative to the prior year. ", "For the full year, adjusted gross margins finished at 67.9%, down 90 basis points from last year's total. Key factors influencing our gross margins include the cost associated with aligning 7 new facilities into the Stryker network as a result of acquisitions, the shift and mix for the year that favored more of our lower margin segments and geographies and the influence of currency on margins based on our manufacturing footprint. ", "Overall, our efforts remain focused on reducing our material and conversion cost in support of our long-term growth strategy, which we believe will drive operating margin expansion. We believe this approach will give us additional flexibility to pursue market expansion and penetration, adjust pricing pressures and make strategic investments and overall deal with an evolving healthcare environment. ", "Research and development finished at 5.2% of sales in the quarter, an increase of 4% versus 2010. The story behind the slowing growth rate versus previous quarters is that several projects moved into the launch phase and we completed our OA OP-1 molecule Phase II study investments. R&D finished the year up 17.3% over 2010, representing 5.6% of sales. ", "Selling, general and administrative costs as reported represented 37.7% of sales in the quarter. Adjusting for acquisition and integration-related charges, SG&A finished at 36.6% of sales, a decline of 20 basis points versus the prior year. For the year, adjusted SG&A finished at 37.1%, a decrease of 20 basis points versus 2010.", "Intangible amortization in the quarter was $32 million and represented 1.4% of sales versus the $16 million and 80 basis points of sales in the prior year. Absent additional acquisitions, the relatively fixed nature of this line provides leverage as we enter 2012. ", "Reported operating income increased 8.3% over prior year and was 18.9% of sales, reflecting the impact of the acquisition-related and restructuring charges. Adjusted operating income increased 4.6%, while the adjusted operating margin of 24.1% of sales decreased 150 basis points versus prior year. 70 basis points of this decline is attributable to the Biotech settlement. ", "Other income and expense as reported increased pretax income by $15 million in the quarter. Excluding the benefit to interest expense related to the Irish cost-sharing arrangement, the remaining components included investment income of $10 million offset by $21 million of interest expense and a negligible FX loss.", "The company's effective income tax rate as reported was 7.4% for the quarter, driven primarily by the settlement of the Irish cost-sharing arrangement as well as tax benefits associated with inventory step up and higher tax rate jurisdictions. Excluding these items, our adjusted rate finished at 25.4% in the quarter. For the full year, our tax rate, excluding the adjusted items, was 25.6%. ", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, up $200 million from the $3.2 billion at the end of the third quarter and a decrease of $1 billion versus December of 2010. The decrease is primarily driven by the $1.5 billion Neurovascular acquisition we completed at the beginning of the year. As a reminder, we now have $1.75 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet associated with our January 2010 debt offering and our September 2011 debt offering.", "On the asset management side, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 58, which represented an increase of 2 days compared to the prior year but was consistent with the third quarter finish. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 158, which was a decrease of 18 days sequentially versus the third quarter. Days finished 4 higher against the prior-year level.", "Turning to cash. In the fourth quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $627 million and free cash flow of $563 million. For the quarter, strong gains and working capital, coupled with solid earnings, drove what was clearly our best performance for the year. ", "Finally, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares, totaling $83 million. For the year, we repurchased 11.8 million shares for a total spend of $622 million. We currently have open authorizations totaling approximately $700 million and finished the year with a diluted share count of approximately 383 million shares.", "In summary, we delivered a solid quarter and completed our year with adjusted per-share earnings at the high end of our initial range. With that said, our focus remains on driving core business growth, continued acquisition integration, operating leverage and a sharpened focus on cash generation. ", "Turning to our outlook. The financial forecast for 2012 begins with the projected net sales increase, excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, of 2% to 5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate reported net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% to 1.5% for the full year of 2012. At current rates, the impact in the first quarter of currency will be negligible. Completed acquisitions are anticipated to add approximately 1.5% to full year reported sales, keeping in mind the influence will be greater in the first half. ", "Turning to the P&L. Our expectations for key areas of the income statement, subject to the normal variations that occur in any given year in the business of our size and complexity, are as follows. For gross margins, we are calling for the underlying range to remain steady, with a subtle, favorable bias subject to the variations driven by currency, business mix and global operations investments. With respect to R&D, on an absolute basis, the dollar level will increase in 2012, while the year-over-year growth rate will decrease as will R&D as a percentage of sales. ", "This is driven by 2 factors: one is the anniversary of our acquisition R&D influence on the investment growth rate; and two, most significantly, our completion of the Phase II OA study for the OP-1 molecule. With respect to the OA opportunity, based on the results of the Phase II data, we have terminated all Stryker efforts as it relates to the OP-1 molecule. Reallocating these funds into our core business segments and factoring this into our 2012 assumptions, our core R&D spending is expected to increase in the 8% to 10% range and will again be over our projected rate of sales growth. ", "In SG&A, we see ongoing opportunities for leverage as a percentage of sales as we look to remain disciplined with respect to discretionary spending and leverage our back office investments across our growing commercial organization. The other income and expense line will turn to more of a headwind in 2012 as we take on the full year expense of the September debt offering. As we look at our expected income tax rate, in 2012, we expect the continued downward bias and would not be surprised by a rate closer to 25% on an adjusted pretax earnings. ", "Given all of the above and in combination with our commercial plans, we expect adjusted diluted net earnings per share for 2012 will result in not less than a double-digit increase over the $3.72 adjusted diluted net earnings we reported in 2012. Considering all the factors involved in our 2011 performance, we are comfortable with first call consensus estimates for both the quarter and the year at this time. Finally, we anticipate acquisition and integration related charges to reduce reported diluted net earnings per share by approximately $0.22. ", "With that, we'll now open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question today comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So first, maybe for Curt, you talked about the impact in the quarter of gross margins mix across some of your businesses and geographies. Could you give us a sense of maybe how that and when over the next several quarters, front half or back half or any kind of color you can provide, as to how that improves and what maybe drives that over the next several quarters?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Matt, I think I'd answer that first by taking a macro look. When we set out our guidance on gross margins for the full year, it was based on the budgeted growth rates that we had assumed for all of our businesses. And clearly, when you look at our full year results on the implant side of our business, whether its hips, knees or spinal implants, those arguably carry much higher gross margins than the core MedSurg offering. So as the year unfolded and frankly the mix of business, the growing -- higher growth segments were more in MedSurg and in some of the geographies that Steve called out in his opening comments, be it emerging markets, which arguably has lower gross margins as well, that ultimately is going to play a big factor in driving the end reported gross margins. And clearly, if you take that down to the fourth quarter, you see a similar type scenario where MedSurg in an absolute basis was a big driver of growth. And while we don't provide the geographic breakout for everybody to see, I can tell you that our emerging markets business with lower grow margins also was a big driver of growth in the quarter. So as we look at 2012, we start kind of in the same fashion. We have business models for growth on our hips and knees or spinal business just like we do in all of our segments, and we base our assumptions on those original plans. And as the year unfolds, we're hopeful that they stay on track. But we also want to be cautious knowing that it's really difficult to predict a forecasted recovery in the Reconstructive market at this time for all the factors that everybody's pretty well aware of at this point in time.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. That's understandable. And one follow up on maybe specifically on knees. It's been kind of lagging. Our expectation is a little -- for lots of reasons that we talked about throughout 2011. Could you give us a sense of maybe what's the catalyst or the driver that you look to get that business back to market growth, back to maybe better-than-market growth rate?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Sure, Matt. I think in 2012, I would expect we'll be certainly back to market growth with especially the shape fitting guides really catching traction now. I mean they took up a while to get launched, ramping up certainly month-over-month in the fourth quarter. And I think we feel very good that we'll be at least back at market growth for knees in the year. And frankly, in hips, we hope to be above market growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's Kim here for Mike. So I guess a couple of questions starting on the MedSurg business. You guys had a great quarter there in the beds and stretchers and came in a little bit better than your competitor ", "[Audio Gap] ", "weeks ago. Wondering if you can give us a little bit of color on that business, how much visibility you feel like you have going forward and any commentary around order rates in backlog in that business.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Sure, Kim. We typically don't want to get too much into orders. But suffice it to say, the business ended the year with some very good momentum. And certainly, the medical business, we do have more visibility than probably any other business that we have and feel very good about the outlook coming off a great year, still feel very good about the outlook here for 2012.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And maybe before I drop, we can just touch on the Ascent business, and that business has rebounded a bit in the last 2 quarters. You had some remarks in your prepared commentary. But how should we think about the market growth rate for reprocessing? And how to think about Ascent, I guess, competitively?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I'll make a couple of comments. I think we still, as was the case at the time of the acquisition, given the relatively low penetration rate still for reprocessing coupled with the obvious economic and environmental benefits, we think a double-digit growth rate is reasonable for this market. As you probably know, Ascent, now Sustainability Solutions, is by far the market leader in that segment. And we really have a great new leadership team in there, and they're focused on driving penetration in existing accounts where they already have a presence but perhaps not in the entire hospital, while also going in and converting hospitals that have not yet adopted reprocessing. And as they continue to expand their product offering and they have roughly 2x the number of 510(k) clearances as their nearest competitor, the economic argument only gets more compelling as you continue to lay more of those clearances into the business, and that's going to be their focus going forward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities USA.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "You walk through the products that you're planning to launch and some of the MedSurg businesses instruments in endoscopy. And historically, we've seen a pretty big impact when you've launched the new Powered Instruments platforms and the new camera system. So I guess I'm just wondering why your guidance is only sort of baking in 5% growth for MedSurg overall. Are you concerned about any kind of a slowdown in capital spending or anything out there?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Mike, I have 2 responses to that. Number one, it's 5% plus. Number 2, I think we'd be foolish to not consider the potential for a capital slowdown, whether it's in the U.S. market or whether it's in some of the international, specifically European markets. Clearly, our penetration there is much lower than in the U.S. But given our footprint in the U.S. market, what's going on in the last couple of years, I think we do have to be very sensitive to the economic uncertainty that to me is still very much present in our environment.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just -- there was a little bit of commentary around the Spine market, but I was wondering, the fundamentals in that market that you saw sort of consistent with the earlier part of the year. Did things seem to get worse at all in the fourth quarter?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "I don't think the market fundamentals got any worse, no.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Steve, I wonder if you could talk us through guidance a little bit here. I think the guidance is set conservative and appropriately, which I think investors appreciate. But if we look at organic growth in 2011, we kind of have here roughly around 4%, and that's kind of flattish at the midpoint of your guidance, which as we said was appropriate. But if you think about organic acceleration as sort of the top end of that guidance and you kind of want to point us to the guidepost we should be looking for if things were to go your way, the factors that could contribute to the upper end of guidance and drive organic acceleration, what would some of those things be here for 2012?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Sure. The factors that would drive upside would be a re-acceleration of the orthopedic implant market, and we'd say both certainly Recon as well as Spine, or our ability to start to maybe take a little more market share in those markets. So I think those would be a clear one. I think the other piece is, to pick up on Curt's comments answering the previous question, if the capital spending is fine in hospitals, we are coming into a very nice product cycle at MedSurg. And so I think there's some upside there. Again, given the last few years where every year plays out a little differently, we wanted to be appropriately cautious coming into the year, but I think feel pretty good. And then businesses like Sustainability Solutions have some real momentum, but they're still very small in the grand scheme.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. And Steve, maybe another one for you. 10% earnings growth, that commitment is becoming increasingly rare among some of your peers. So I guess the question we get a lot from investors lately is why now? Why go forward with that restructuring initiative today? Was it more of a factor of the medical device tax? Was it where you saw your operating performance on the revenue side coming in for 2012? Was it your gross margin dynamics? Just help us understand sort of why today or heading into '12 is the right time. Was it commitment to 10%, or a variety of other factors you were seeing?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "As everything we do is probably multifactorial, David, but let's try to prioritize it. First off, I would say it underscores our longer-term look at where the markets are going, and particularly trying to recognize that we are staring at a huge tax coming in, in 2013 and we weren't going to just duck that. So in so doing, looking at what can we be thinking about in some [indiscernible] efforts, combined frankly with some of the acquisitions that we'd done in certainly the 2010 time frame and relooking at some of the facilities that we picked up there, as well as some of the fundamentals in both Europe and even, say, our orthopedics division in the United States with some slowdowns, frankly just trying to be realistic and say what can we do to be planning for the future. So I would say that is much more a 2013 and beyond play and so that we can power through for years ahead with double-digit earnings growth. And we are very focused on that and think that, that will be increasingly a differentiator, particularly as people start to look from 2012 to 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just one on Spine and then one on guidance. Just to start on Spine, if we exclude acquisitions and look at just kind of your core Spine growth, is it safe to say it's still in that negative mid single-digit territory?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And about a similar growth rate to what you saw last quarter?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes, I think so, right? Yes.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the guidance, could you just give a little more color, what kind of operating margin -- adjusted operating margin improvement are you assuming in your guidance? And if you would, also what kind of buyback or share count reduction are you assuming in that guidance as well?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I'll start with the second one first, Bob. Right now we do have an outstanding share repurchase authorization that could take us up to about $700 million. Our current guidance assumes no influence from buybacks. And again, you don't do buybacks just as a matter of routine and you can see that through the last couple of years that we've been fairly judicious and when we executed on the open buyback authorization. So right now our guidance does not assume any influence from buybacks. Second, I probably not going to give any real specific numbers here on operating margin leverage. But I think when you look at the totality of what we put in to our guidance, number one, we have a good range on the revenue side and I think it really reflects some of the steps we've taken the last couple of years to strengthen the core businesses as well as add things like Sustainability Solutions and Neurovascular. With that, those -- as everybody on the call well knows, they bring intangible amortization. And with increasing sales year-over-year, there's very implied leverage on that. There's also, when you do acquisitions, there's acquisition charges that you call out, and then there are other just inherent charges or expenses that the company takes as you try to put these businesses into the mainstream of your broader organization. And as we get further downstream from these acquisitions, those expenses should be dropping off. So there's leverage that we start to see and start -- comes to the benefit of the company. So I just -- I still remain confident that there's leverage in our overall operations on a global basis, and that gives me confidence in our outlook.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Bob, if I could just pile on there. If you think about the earnings power that we generated both in the fourth quarter but even for the full year on what is probably some slightly lower gross margins, then people would have expected at the start of the year the earnings power is there through the P&L.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Curt, your guidance includes a slight improvement in gross margins, is that correct?", "Curt R. Hartman", "That's correct.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And what sort of pricing are you assuming for 2012 given that we'll presumably see Japan start to have their price cuts beginning in April?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Our pricing outlook is consistent really with what we've seen over the last 2 years, arguably understanding that the Japan price cuts are on the horizon. However, those are factored into our outlook as well. Now we're not 100% certain exactly what those rates are going to be. We have some best estimates. So to the extent that they are materially worse than what we've planned, we'll have to find a way to absorb those through other parts of the business. But right now, last 2 years, price has been down 1.7%, 1.8% and our outlook calls for a continued trend in that direction.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the restructuring. I know you guys announced the program in November, and then obviously you've had the operations journey you talked about last May. When -- I guess are those 2 separate events? And then when might we get some more details on operations journey just in terms of longer term how much cost can come out of the system?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Those are very appropriate questions, Kristen. On the restructuring that we announced, which just going back to Steve's earlier comment, a lot of that was directed towards continuing to evolve the business be it through the acquisition side or through the internal restructurings that we announced in the fourth quarter. And as you can see from our press release, we took about $76 million of actual charges in the quarter against that restructuring, which the original plan called for around $150 million to $175 million. So we've taken about half of it. The rest of it will flow through throughout the course of 2012. And the benefits, as we said at the outset, would principally accrue as we hit 2013, and that remains the way we're rolling this program out. As far -- and I want to make sure that we talk about the efforts on global manufacturing. Some of the restructuring does involve some of the global manufacturing work. However, I would say in general on global manufacturing, people ask, \"What inning are you in?\" And I would tell you, we're still in the batters box. We've got the team lined up. They fundamentally all work for Lonny now starting January 1. We've got a lot of programs lined up. But as everybody knows, when you start getting into global manufacturing, you've got lots of constituents that you have to satisfy from a regulatory standpoint. And given our recent history on the quality journey, we're not going to move so quick that we stub our toe and get back in the penalty box on the quality standpoint with any regulatory body around the world. So it's probably a little premature to talk about benefits from anything that comes out of our global manufacturing network. Though I would tell you, part of our plan does assume a slightly better cost reduction drive out of our manufacturing network in 2012 than what the company has historically seen, and I'm confident saying that, and that with the efforts that we have right now, we should achieve that.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tao Levy with Collins Stewart.", "Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division", "On the Neurovascular business, you indicated that you started to get back to sort of market growth rates, I think upper single digits. Where does that stand now? And is that -- do you, as you exit 2012, you expect to get to those rates, or it's beginning here in Q1?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think what we're trying to discuss there when we announced the deal back in 2010, 2011 was about stability, new product launches, folding as much of the organization into Stryker as we could and I think we've been successful in all fronts. We've had a very successful global launch of the new coil. Obviously, when we enter 2011, we didn't anticipate the Concentric acquisition, but it clearly became apparent to us that there was a great opportunity here and we're excited to have that onboard. And so as we hit 2012, our goal is to be back at market growth rates. So you should assume that, that means day one of 2012 we're back at market growth rates. Getting into the specifics of how you define the market, there's obviously been a lot of new technologies that have come into that market, that have slowed some segments down and increased growth in other segments. So it's a blended number, and as Katherine said, it's kind of in the high-single digits that we're looking at as the number we have to achieve or beat to call ourselves successful this year.", "Tao Levy - Collins Stewart LLC, Research Division", "And sorry if I missed this earlier on. You're heading into AAOS next month. Any new big products that you're expecting to be talking more about?", "Katherine A. Owen", "We highlighted a couple of them on the call as it relates to the next-generation power tool. And similar to prior years, we'll have a smattering of new products mostly, as you know, tend to be singles and doubles as you think about the company in totality with respect to revenue contribution. So we'll have booth tours where folks can come around and see the products. But beyond that, probably wait for The Academy to really walk through in detail.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Feinstein with Barclays Capital.", "Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Just wanted to ask just in terms of -- everyone's been trying to figure out when is the market going to rebound here. And clearly, it's been difficult making any sort of call there, and you guys have a lot of flexibility and just a great balance sheet in terms of the ability to take one more leverage. So I guess just as in the past, you guys have talked about acquisition opportunities, and you've done a great job in terms of finding those acquisitions and getting better than industry average growth as a result. But I guess how do you contemplate in terms of thinking about running the balance sheet 2x leverage, which would be very comfortable and just buying back -- I mean, you once again, you guys have been buying back a lot of stock, but you could buy back significantly more and generate a lot of earnings growth from that. And then when the ortho rebound does come, you could certainly contemplate capital structure in the future. But just curious as you weigh the acquisitions against doing something like that?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Well, I think it's one strategy, Adam. I don't think it's our strategy. We've laid out that our strategy for the balance sheet is really 3 avenues. First and foremost, we're all in it for the long term, and that implies that we want to go out and do acquisitions of platforms that provide long-term growth. And that's, I think, arguably what people would say if they look back over the last 3 years that we've done as a first priority. With that said, we do recognize the strength of our balance sheet and the ability of our organization to generate a lot of cash. And that gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic as it relates to share buybacks, which I think we've also demonstrated over the last couple of years. And then also at the same time, we've tried to embark on a more consistent approach to the dividend yield and trying to move the dividend to where it's a more meaningful contribution for shareholder return. We have not yet identified an exact percentage of cash that we're going to put into these efforts, and I'm hesitant to do that in the near term because I think we're still evolving the company's use of its balance sheet. But right now, I will tell you we're not going to run out and do a great, big massive share buyback. That's just not our stated strategy. Not saying it's a bad strategy. It's not just ours.", "Adam T. Feinstein - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Definitely. I understand that. But at some point, do you feel like the balance sheet's under levered? I mean, I guess in a difficult market environment, I know people like balance sheets that don't have much, much leverage. So certainly, you guys benefit from that, but then at the same time, it's just once again, you can run the company very well at 2x leverage and have more ability to either buy back stock or pay a bigger dividend and still do the acquisitions?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Adam, we like where we are in terms of leverage. We sleep really well at night with conservatism. And frankly, go back to the summer of '08 where we were criticized quite highly I think for having so much cash on our balance sheet. And that cash came in real handy during the downturn. We've been able to scoop up a lot of assets, $2.5 billion plus of acquisitions over the last 25-ish months and still have a net position. So I think we like it. We don't feel a need to be over levered as it is. It could be more efficient, but we like where we are.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if I could ask, I know it's a difficult question, but you look at the orthopedic growth rates now and it's been I think 7 quarters where things have kind of been running below what we would expect to be trend. And there's been several companies, including your own, kind of saying that things are not getting much worse but we're still waiting for things to improve. I guess, I know it's a very difficult question, but 7 quarters is a long time, particularly given some of the trends that you've mentioned in terms of people being unable to withstand the pain for long periods of time and just the natural demographic trends here. So when do you contemplate we'll see something?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think what we've learned is trying to predict when you see a re-acceleration of these patients is extremely hard to predict. We haven't seen this magnitude of a slowdown in elective procedures in past economic recessions to use as a reference point. I would go back to our initial comments; it's clearly a function of unemployment rates. They need to come down. What the magic number is, we don't know. But at some point, as those unemployment rates come down, there is a lag effect where people either get healthcare coverage with their new job or they're comfortable taking the time off. And then there's the natural disease progression, which underscores our conviction that you just simply can't defer it permanently. But in order to make sure that we delivered on our top and bottom line targets for the year, we're going to go with the assumption that there's no change from 2011 rates and that they may remain fairly consistent with those levels.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Also, Raj, we love our diverse footprint, probably liking our cash and leverage position, feeling really good that the percentage of business that's associated that way.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Sure, sure. Just as sort of follow-up kind of the Recon market. I know you gave overall corporate-wide pricing of negative 1.7%. But when you look specifically at Recon within orthopedics, have you seen any change in the pricing in those particular markets, hips and knees?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No. Very consistent with prior quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Curt, I just wanted to clarify something on the P&L guidance with respect to R&D. I believe you said it will be up in absolute dollars, but then down as a percentage of sales. And I think you also made a reference to it being up in the 8% to 10% range. Did I mix that all up?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes -- no, it's a fair question, David. The R&D guidance for next year is that in absolute dollars, it will be bigger than this year. As a percentage of sales, it will probably be a little bit below where we finished this year. And my reference to 8% to 10% is that given our decision to terminate anything related to the OA program or our Biotech business, the decision was made to reallocate those dollars into the core of the business and on an apples-to-apples basis, it implies an 8% to 10% increase for the broad business R&D increase. You will not see an 8% to 10% increase in our reported numbers.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. That's very helpful. Then in a commentary surrounding gross margins being about flattish or slightly up for 2012, it sounds that there are some factors that are transient, such as manufacturing variances on lower volumes and some that may just be a reflection of the changing mix of your business as it relates to the MedSurg business growing faster than the Reconstructive business. Can you maybe help us think about the gross margin dynamic on a longer-term basis and then also how new products fit into the trajectory for gross margins?", "Curt R. Hartman", "It's a great question. And clearly, when you look at MedSurg, when you look at expansion in emerging markets and everybody's talking about that, those businesses are on the lower side of our company gross margin. And we're okay with that. We know how to operate lower gross margin businesses and still generate a lot of profit and a lot of cash. So that movement does not concern us and does not inhibit our thoughts that we can still generate double-digit earnings growth. And so longer term and especially when you consider all the things that are evolving in healthcare on a global basis, you may be looking at healthcare that has a lower overall gross margin. And I think what I would tell you and others may tell you is we're comfortable with that trend. That said, all of our efforts from a global manufacturing standpoint, a plant network simplification standpoint, a vendor simplification standpoint, a harmonization of quality systems, are all geared at driving higher gross margins across the business. So we're not afraid of it going in one direction, but we're also lining up a number of initiatives today, tomorrow, next 5 or 10 years, that are geared at driving higher gross margins.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Vivian Cervantes with Kaufman Bros.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "Appreciate your comments on gross margins and the different factors that are driving it. With 7 acquisition facilities being ingrained to slowing down utilization to absorb and come up with appropriate inventory levels and then having a lineup of initiatives that would improve gross margins over time. If we were to sort of wrap this together and try and come up with a takeaway, can you say that maybe some of the heavy lifting may be behind us now and that what we're looking for going forward would be more refinements?", "Curt R. Hartman", "No. I don't want anybody to think that at all. I think our simplification of the plant network is very much in front of us. And as I said, we're just getting started with those efforts. They are long-term efforts. They are complicated efforts. I'd noted 7 facilities. Keep in mind, the Neurovascular acquisition brings 3 facilities, none of which have yet transferred to Stryker. So we have 3 more facilities coming into our network. So the thought about simplifying the business plant network, while at the same time absorbing 3 new facilities, still sits in the very near-term horizon, nevermind the long-term opportunity to consolidate core competencies into different manufacturing campuses and simplify the business. So there is a journey there and it's a long journey. And frankly, when I look at it, I get excited because I can see what the potential is and I can see how it can benefit the company over the long term. But again, we're going to move cautiously because any time you move a product, you open up a whole can of quality potential issues. And we are going to do everything we can to avoid that.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "That's helpful. So then...", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "And to pile of there, Vivian. I think at the end of the day, what you should be taking away certainly from Curt's comments is we see significant cost improvement abilities over probably the next decade. We're probably still in the early -- the very early stages of cost savings opportunities. Where that plays out in gross margin based on business mix, pricing, everything else, who knows exactly. But I think there's also a tremendous confidence that we have, that frankly, whether gross margins improve by 10, 30, 50 basis points in a year or decline by that same amount, we're actually in great shape to be able to deliver on the operating line. So again, we think it's going to modestly improve next year as we've said, very modestly, but we're prepared and can deliver in different scenarios.", "Vivian Cervantes - Kaufman Bros., L.P., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And as a follow-up, there was a comment made that there is earnings power despite the gross margin performance. Is this where we see SG&A leverage coming in from the volume of products that you're able to put in front of customers with not just Recon, but MedSurg? Is that how we really should think about the sustainability of your operating leverage going forward, just more SG&A leverage as gross margin works itself out through the journey over time?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Very much so, Vivian. And again, let's take some specific examples. As we -- I think the hidden part and the hidden magic of a lot of the acquisition work we've done over the last few years of product tuck-ins have been we're putting more volume through our existing sales channels. So the Gaymar acquisition now gives our same medical sales force the ability to sell surfaces in addition to frames. Orthovita drops in and we have existing selling organizations that are now able to sell that in addition to hardware. So a lot of what we're doing on the acquisition fronts are giving our salespeople more to put through the same amount of people. And there is a hidden leverage there that will be coming, and again, frankly, because a lot of these are just recent, that will be coming in the years ahead as well.", "Curt R. Hartman", "And I think just to pile on that and to kind of emphasize a long-term view here, in 2008, our adjusted gross margins were 68.3%. This year, we finished at 67.9%, 40 basis points lower. If I would have told everybody that in 2008 they'd only be down 40 basis points in 3 years, I think everybody would have doubted me. And then the other factor is SG&A in 2008 was 39.1% of sales. This year, adjusted SG&A will finish at 37.1%, so 200 basis point improvement. So I call those out because I want to underscore our commitment to the longer-term outlook, and I'm not tracking this quarter-over-quarter because none of these projects are quarter-over-quarter. They're long-term projects that we commit our organization to, our resources, our people, and it gives me great confidence that we'll achieve the leverage we need to get to make the earnings hang together.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I have 2 questions. One, do I understand you right that you expect your SG&A management to offset all of the med tech tax 2013 so you can deliver double-digit EPS growth?", "Curt R. Hartman", "We expect to be able to deliver double digit or greater growth in 2013 inclusive of absorbing the med device tax. So if you do a fast-forward math on that, it implies we have to grow earnings about 17% give or take depending on how the med device tax spills out and what our U.S. sales are.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "But Joanne, that will come from a combination of cost of goods, SG&A, maybe a little bit tax rate, just kind of everything. The restructuring that we announced, so it will be in various buckets on the P&L.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes. It's not just SG&A leverage.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "That's very helpful. My second question is, I think if I heard you correctly, you gave 5%-type plus of revenue growth rate for MedSurg and Neuro, but didn't comment on Recon for 2012, or maybe I missed it.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, Recon we said it's going to be up to 3% growth in terms of the assumptions behind the 2% to 5% growth x acquisitions and currency. And then MedSurg and the Neurotech segment, 5% or better.", "Operator", "Your next caller is Jason Wittes with Caris.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "If you could just help me out on how to understand some of the product launches in MedSurg. I know that you just -- it sounds like in the fourth quarter some of the upside was due to the launch of the new series 7 tool set. Is that -- when you launch these new tool sets, do you normally get a replacement cycle sort of precipitated? Or are there other factors that can kind of lead to that? And related to that, are these generally long cycles in terms of upgrades when you have a new product? Is this something that can generally run a year or more in terms of seeing those upgrades occur in the market place? And likewise for endoscopy too with your new cameras.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Jason on System 7, that's a Stryker instrument's product, and the last new power tool, the previous generation was introduced in 2006. So the answer is yes, they have long cycles, number one. Number two, I would not read into the fourth quarter for instruments as benefiting substantially from the System 7 introduction. It was a limited introduction. We more fully launched it at their National Sales Meeting in January, and we'll show it broadly to customers at AAOS. So I think what you're just seeing there is a good performance overall by the instrument segment on a global basis. On the endoscopy side, it's very much a similar approach. The cycle is a little bit shorter. Cameras -- the last camera we introduced was January of '09. You could argue that our timing was not great, but those cycles are little bit quicker than on the power tool side. And there is a natural uptick because the technology makes the procedure more efficient to staff, more efficient, and obviously, we're putting both incremental and real innovation into those products to drive customer and patient benefit.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I think I heard you say that you're anticipating some share gains in hips this year based on some new products. Did I hear that correctly? And if that's the case, is that -- would that also be something that would be more back-end loaded in terms of seeing a share gain?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "You heard us correctly that we expect share gains in hips, not necessarily linked to new products. It's the growth of MDM really particularly getting, and I think we gained share here in 2011 and it will be a continuation. Hopefully, we'll have some things. We probably got Accolade coming later in the year as well, but I think it's the ramp from MDM right now.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But not necessarily the case for knees, I assume, at this point based on what you're saying?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "That really is shape fitting, the growth of shape fitting coming on. But we're not expecting to necessarily be taking share, but at least be at market.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I had a question on Europe. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color for us on Europe. We read about the potential for recession and austerity. And I'm wondering if we go into a recession in Europe, does it hurt your ortho more or your MedSurg business more? And then maybe provide us some color with how you expect both ortho and MedSurg to grow in 2012 and does it assume a recession.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "We're assuming continued softness in Europe. I think the positive for us is, frankly, on both our Recon and our MedSurg businesses, we're significantly below our standard market shares in Europe. So that even if it slows down, we still have share gain opportunities, frankly, among our implant businesses and our MedSurg businesses. So we don't see it having a material impact even if Europe slows further.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And is your share -- the percentage of your business in Europe on average the group is about 25%. Are you at that level?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "No. We are below that.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So if Europe goes into a recession, you think there's areas outside the U.S. that can pick up. Is that correct?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then one last question, just on CapEx spending. Do you expect CapEx in Europe to be stable, worse? And perhaps any thoughts on U.S. CapEx spending for 2012.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Europe, we're certainly not anticipating an increase, and again, our MedSurg businesses are underdeveloped there. So we see opportunity even in a lower CapEx environment. I think in the U.S., we're assuming things are reasonably fine, but again being cautious in our outlook as we start the year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Matthew O'Brien with William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "But just thinking about extremities a little bit with your Memometal acquisition last year, is there any thought -- and I know you have a shoulder system already, but any thought to really increasing your presence in what's the larger of the 2 extremity markets?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "And is that a 2012 or later time frame?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "We've got a shoulder now, and obviously, the extremities piece we'll continue to refine and expand that offering over time.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would just recognize that as a percent of our total business and even as a percent of our Recon when you look at the shoulders and that extremity segment, it's really not that material at this point.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just any kind of update on Orthovita uptake among your sales reps. I mean, are you starting to benefit somewhat from the dynamics that are playing out in the biologics market in Spine?", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Yes, we really -- VITA's line has been a tremendous addition. Certainly, some opportunities to restart CORTOSS, and Vitagel is a nice little gem in that bag as well.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the question-and-answer portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the conference back over to management for some closing remarks.", "Stephen P. MacMillan", "Great. Well, thank you. We certainly appreciate your time today, and hopefully, you feel good about where we're headed here in 2012. We certainly do. And the conference call for our first quarter 2012 operating results will be held on April 17 of this year. So we'll talk to you in a few months time, but we'll see a lot of you at The Academy in a couple of weeks. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to take the time and read the Safe Harbor statement.", "Certain statements made in this presentation may contain information that includes or is based on forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws that are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.", "Such factors include, but are not limited to, weakening of economic conditions that could adversely affect the level of demand for the company's products; pricing pressures generally, including cost containment measures that could adversely affect the price of or demand for the company's products; changes in foreign exchange markets; legislative and regulatory actions; unanticipated issues arising in connection with clinical studies and otherwise that affect U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of new products;   changes in reimbursement levels from third-party payers; a significant increase in product liability claims; resolution of tax audits; changes in financial markets; changes in the competitive environment; the company's ability to integrate acquisitions; and the company's ability to realize anticipated cost savings as a result of workforce reductions and other restructuring activities.", "Additional information concerning these and other factors are contained in the company filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Curt Hartman, interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed, sir.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thank you, Derek. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's first quarter 2012 earnings report. Joining me on the call is Katherine Owen, Vice President Strategy and Investor Relations. In terms of the format for today's call, I will provide opening comments and then turn the call over to Katherine for an update on several key focus items. I will then cover the financials before opening the call up to your questions. ", "Consistent with previous quarters, our press release contains additional detail that we encourage you to review relating to our quarterly performance.", "On that note, first quarter sales finished at $2.16 billion, up 7.2% as reported and 7.4% in constant currency. As shown in the supplemental sales chart in the press release, it is clear that our revenue growth was balanced, both by segment and geography. ", "The quarterly and year-over-year increase in our Reconstructive segment sales augmented continued strength in MedSurg and a solid showing from Neurotechnology and Spine. The balanced revenue growth reinforces our conviction in the benefits provided by our diverse offering, supported by a strategy of internal innovation and focused acquisition. More specifically, our Reconstructive results were led by a solid sequential and year-over-year acceleration in both hip and knee implants. ", "Within MedSurg, instruments delivered strong growth of over 10%, fueled by the launch of our System 7 power tools, and our Sustainability Solutions business delivered another solid, high-growth quarter. ", "Finally, within Neurotechnology and Spine, solid gains from Interventional Spine, Neurovascular, and Neuro, Spine and ENT were partially offset by continued challenge in our spinal hardware segment. ", "Overall, sales excluding currency and acquisitions posted an increase of 5.2% in Q1 versus our 2% to 5% expectation for the full year.", "With these sales results, our adjusted per-share earnings increased 10% to $0.99. The 10% adjusted earnings per share increase is in line with our target for double-digit per-share earnings growth. Additionally, this performance includes absorbing roughly $0.015 per share of onetime SG&A expense associated with the previously disclosed separation agreement.", "Finally, I'll provide an update regarding the board's search for a permanent CEO. As stated previously, the board, in conjunction with an outside search firm, is conducting a comprehensive and thorough search of both internal and external candidates. That process is ongoing, and although the timing of an announcement is impossible to predict, the board is comfortable with the pace of the review. ", "In the interim, as our Q1 results reflect, we remain focused on executing our strategic objectives and delivering on our financial commitments. The results of these efforts underscore the collective strength of this company, which includes our global offering of products and services, our dedicated employees and the strength we have built with our customers and markets.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Curt. There are 4 key topics where I will try and provide some additional details, including hip and knee pricing and elective procedure trends, an acquisition integration update, our Global Quality and Operations initiatives and an update regarding key new product launches.", "Starting with pricing. In an attempt to provide greater granularity by our key segments and to help facilitate your modeling, the press release includes a breakdown of our sales growth by volume, mix and price for our 3 key business segments: reunion -- excuse me, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine. As it relates to our hip and knee pricing trend, during Q1, U.S. pricing remained negative in the low single-digits and was largely offset by favorable mix, particularly within our hip segment. Although the overall trend improved again this quarter, our forecasts do not assume a meaningful change in the pricing environment, and we continue to assume pricing as modestly negative and partly offset by mix.", "Turning to elective procedure trends. We did not see any meaningful re-acceleration in volumes during the quarter. Rather, the environment appeared stable. Recall that our assumptions for full year Reconstructive sales growth excluding currency and acquisitions of less than 3% are predicated on the assumption that there's no notable change in elective procedure trends. Given the progressive nature of OA, combined with the fact that we are essentially entering year 2 of the recession-induced slowdown in elective procedures, an uptick is possible but as yet is not evident. We are comfortable with the assumptions we outlined at the start of the year and believe we are appropriately resourced to execute on the financial targets for our Reconstructive segment in 2012.", "Shifting to the acquisitions update. As many of you are aware, we completed a series of acquisitions in the 2010 and 2011 time frame. With respect to the deals completed in 2011, in total, they contributed over 2 percentage points of sales growth in Q1. And while recognizing there are always challenges with any M&A activity, overall, we are generally pleased with the integration progress and the financial results achieved to date. ", "With respect to our most recent acquisition, we continue to target 510(k) clearance of Concentric's  stent retriever device in 2012 or possibly 2013 and look forward to the opportunity to further leverage our market-leading presence in stroke care with this next-generation device targeted at the ischemic segment. Going forward, our BD activity remains focused on targets that both leverage our existing sales footprint while also elevating key adjacent market segments.", "Next, an update on our Global Quality and Operations, or GQO, initiatives, which are part of our previously discussed efforts to drive greater efficiencies within our decentralized model while maintaining our focus on quality. We are now starting to see the initial signs of the leverage we are targeting from these efforts as 2012 will be the second consecutive year of favorable standard cost improvements following years of standard cost increases.", "As we look ahead to 2013, we expect to see continued improvements with incrementally higher standard cost reductions year-over-year. More specifically, we expect to deliver a minimum 2% reduction in standard costs in 2013, which represents another sequential year-over-year improvement. We are also working to improve the efficiency of our global plant infrastructure, which includes the closing and divestiture of 2 facilities, which is currently under way, while we are consolidating a third facility into an existing plant. In addition, we are in the process of consolidating a portion of our U.S. distribution to one facility, which should be largely complete by year end. The benefit of this initiative will include lower freight costs within SG&A and, to a lesser degree, leverage of the fixed and variable cost lines. ", "Finally, we are starting to see the benefit from our ongoing investments in quality, such as improved reliability of new product launches, which is the obvious benefit to our customers, while also helping to lower warranty expense within SG&A. By way of example, looking at our System 7 next-generation power tool, the customer complaint rate is less than 1%, which compares favorably with the prior generation, System 6.", "While we have highlighted some clear positive steps on our journey to drive greater efficiencies, we have also seen some challenges. Of note, given the heightened level of M&A activity, we have added meaningfully to our manufacturing footprint with 11 additional plants, only partly offset by the aforementioned closing, divestiture and consolidation. Integrating these facilities has resulted in some margin pressure, which will continue during 2012. And as we take a more comprehensive look at our manufacturing footprint, we are focused on reducing inventory in certain areas, which also adds pressure to the P&L near term.", "All told, we believe the myriad initiatives under way within GQ and O are having a positive impact, recognizing we are still in the relatively early stages but with the benefits that will be evident in our P&L on a long-term basis. The acceleration in this contribution is one component behind our conviction in our ability to deliver on our stated goal of double-digit per-share adjusted earnings growth, including in 2013, when we will also be absorbing the impact of the medical device excise tax.", "Finally, a few comments regarding key new products within our major business segments. Starting with the Reconstruct, our hip sales continue to see the benefit from the uptick of both the ADM and MDM mobile bearing systems that allow for a large hip head without the need for a metal-on-metal component. Combined, ADM and ADM (sic) [MDM] represented approximately 21% of our U.S. hip cup procedures exiting the quarter, up from 17% at the end of 2011, underscoring the market's receptivity to an ultimate large-head implant system.", "The launch of Accolade 2, our next-generation version of the highly successful Accolade primary hip system, is now under way. Accolade 2 offers a better implant fit for a wider range of patients, and given surgeons' familiarity with the existing Accolade platform, we anticipate a relatively faster rollout than the normal timing for a new hip or knee system, recognizing it will cannibalize existing Accolades sales to some degree, but we also expect to see competitive surgeon conversions.", "Within our MedSurg segment, we are pleased with the market acceptance of our System 7 power tool, which helped drive over a 20% increase in U.S. heavy-duty sales in the quarter. We're expecting both customer upgrades and competitive conversions. ", "And Stryker Sustainability Solutions delivered its fifth quarter of sequentially higher sales with over 20% year-over-year growth owing to additional 510(k) clearances of products that can be reprocessed as well as a more favorable competitive environment.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Curt.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. As noted, positive growth across our 3 segments coupled with acquisition growth, principally in Neurotech and Spine, increased company sales 7.2% on a reported basis and 7.4% on a constant currency basis. ", "With respect to earnings, we delivered encouraging results with adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.99, representing growth of 10% over Q1 of 2011.  On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.91, an increase of 16.7% versus Q1 of 2011. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP EPS is provided in the tables accompanying today's press release. ", "In reviewing the quarter, I'll start with a discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the quarter, volume and mix contributed 6.9% to our top line growth, acquisitions added 2.3% and currency decreased top line sales by approximately $4 million and decreased the company's overall reported sales growth by 20 basis points. Company-wide selling prices declined 1.7% on a worldwide basis. ", "We did have an additional selling day versus 2011. The calculation would compute a 1.6% favorable impact to growth rates. We would note, however, that the extra day principally benefits our procedure-driven business to include Reconstructive and other implant lines, while capital sales are not materially impacted by variations in selling days.", "Finally, by way of providing additional information, the details regarding the components of revenue growth for each of the 3 reporting segments are provided in today's press release.", "Looking at our reporting segments, I'll start with Reconstructive products, which represented 44% of our sales in the quarter. Reconstructive products include our hip, knee, trauma and other Reconstructive lines. Our Reconstructive segment had a solid quarter with sales up 5.2%, both as reported and on a constant currency basis. First quarter growth in hips, knees and trauma and extremities improved sequentially from fourth quarter results. Acquisitions added 6% to the Trauma top line. Overall, it was a nice performance for our hip and knee implants, which posted both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth. Importantly, our results included positive growth in the Reconstructive lines across our European market.", "Next, I'll turn to the MedSurg product segment, which represented 38% of sales in the quarter. For reporting purposes, MedSurg is comprised of instruments, Endoscopy, Medical and the Sustainability Solutions business. ", "In total, MedSurg sales increased 7.5% as reported and 7.9% on a constant currency basis. Results were paced by a strong performance from instruments and another quarter of solid performance by our Sustainability Solutions business. We expect instruments and Sustainability Solutions will remain growth drivers for the quarters ahead.", "Internationally, our Medical and Endoscopy segments recorded strong performance. However, in the U.S. market, Medical was disappointing after 8 quarters of solid results, and Endoscopy, as previously mentioned, is looking toward a strong second half product introduction cycle. ", "Overall, the results for MedSurg reflect continued strength, and we remain encouraged by the new product plans and look forward to a solid 2012 from MedSurg.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represented 18% of company sales in the quarter, increased 12.4% as reported and 12.3% on a constant currency basis. As noted in the press release, acquisitions added 8% to the constant currency gain, reflecting the performance of the Orthovita and Concentric acquisitions. We continued to generate strong high-teen growth from our Interventional Spine and NSE offerings as well as the positive influence of the NV business, which is now part of the underlying growth.", "Finally, Spine results, while greatly benefiting from the Orthovita acquisition and new product introductions, remain under continued pressure in the spinal implant category in terms of both price and volumes.", "I'll now turn to income statement, beginning with our gross margin performance. ", "On a reported basis, gross margin finished at 67.2%. This included $14 million of inventory step-up and other restructuring-related charges. Excluding the charges, margins finished at 67.8%, which is down 70 basis points from last year but up 50 basis points from the fourth quarter. Factors influencing margins in the quarter relative to the prior year included a 50-basis-point decline associated with the previously mentioned pricing pressure. Additionally, margins were negatively impacted from higher inventory charges, while the impact of currency in our quarterly sales mix were not meaningful in the quarter.", "Overall, we expect gross margin in Q2 to be generally consistent with Q1, with modest year-over-year improvement anticipated in half 2 and full year levels trending slightly above 2011.", "Research and development finished at 5.2% of sales. Overall, the absolute dollar spend was consistent with anticipated levels, as noted in the January call. ", "SG&A costs represented 37.9% of sales. And adjusting for restructuring and acquisition-related charges, SG&A finished at 37.5% of sales. This is slightly higher than our prior year levels although represents leverage after considering the impact of the separation agreement in the first quarter, which is recorded in G&A.", "Reported operating income increased 12.5% over prior year and was 22% of sales. Adjusted operating income increased 4.7%, while the adjusted operating margin decreased to 23.7% as a result of the previously mentioned items.", "Other income and expense reduced pretax income by $8 million in the quarter but was $4 million favorable versus prior year. Components of this included investment income and interest of $12 million, offset by interest expense of $20 million.", "And finally, the company's effective income tax rate was 25.2% for the first quarter of the 2012. This was in line with our expectations and was 20 basis points lower than Q4 after excluding the impact of tax settlements and inventory step-up.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, which was a decrease of approximately $100 million from year-end 2011. As a reminder, we have $1.75 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet associated with our January 2010 $1 billion debt offering and our September 2011 $750 million debt offering.", "On the asset management side, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 61, which represented an increase of 3 days compared to year end. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 169, which was up 11 days sequentially versus year-end and 8 days against the prior year level, partially reflecting investments in new product introduction cycles.", "Turning to cash. In the first quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $35 million. Overall, we're not pleased with that performance. ", "Finally, in the first quarter, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares for a total spend of $50 million. We currently have open authorizations totaling approximately $653 million.", "In summary, the first quarter was a solid start, and we remain comfortable with our initial sales and earnings targets that we provided at the start of the year. Specifically, we anticipate sales growth at 2% to 5% for the full year, excluding the impact from currency and acquisitions, and we'll deliver not less than double-digit adjusted per-share earnings growth.", "Currency remains a slight headwind, and if rates hold near current levels, we would expect second quarter sales to be negatively impacted by approximately 1% to 2% when compared to 2011. Using current rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales would be negative in a range of 0.5% to 1.5% when compared to 2011, which is consistent with our original expectations.", "In closing, we look forward to building on the strength of our first quarter results. Maximizing the performance of the various acquisitions, we're continuing to launch new products resulting from our ongoing investments and internal innovation.", "With that, we'll now open the call up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "Our first question is coming from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So this quarter, from a hip and knee perspective, you've got an extra selling day and you've got some easier comps, and we're all going to be busy trying to adjust for those items. But I was wondering if you could help us in that regard. When you look at your hip and knee sales rates on kind of a same-day sales basis in Q1 versus Q4, do you think that the volume of procedures is roughly flat in terms of the level of Q4? Or was there an uptick sequentially?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Bob, it's Katherine. It's probably closer to flat, stable, as we mentioned in our prepared comments. It feels like the environment may be getting a little bit better, but with just one quarter and some of the seasonality, seasonal anomalies that happen between Q4 and Q1, it's probably too soon to say if we've seen a real change in the trend. But it certainly feels very stable at the moment.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, Curt, on the operating margin side, in 2012, when you net out all the comments that you made, how much operating margin leverage should we expect in 2012? And then if you could also just comment on the cash flow generation in the quarter, that would be helpful as well.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Sure, Bob. I think when we look at the operating margins, we started the year with an assumption that it would -- we would roll through the year and finish somewhere a little bit north of 68%. I think we remain committed to that. I would point back, however, to some of Katherine's comments in her prepared comments relative to the integration of the facilities and the investments that those require to bring quality systems on par with what we have across our global network at this point in time. In addition, to somehow align these efforts in GQ and O do acquire upfront investments before you see the long-term benefit of those. And as Katherine tried to comment, we are seeing some of that benefit starting to show up in standard costs that impact future periods. So we're encouraged, though acknowledge it, certainly. On cash, as I said very briefly in my comments, it was not our best day. There's not one particular area that really stands out in terms of driving the performance, though I would note we did have some legal settlements previously disclosed that were paid in the quarter, like the Biotech settlement. We also had some larger-than-anticipated tax payments that impacted cash in the quarter as well. But when you look at all the other categories, working capital, inventory increased, DSO increased, accounts payable actually decreased, which was a negative as well, so it just -- frankly, if I summed it up, it was not our best performance, and I think it's something that we've reinvigorated our focus on here starting in the second quarter.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to -- I guess Bob had asked about operating margins, and one of the things in the quarter that would have expected to see a little bit more on would have been SG&A leverage. You did kind of talk a little bit about the separation agreement. Was that something that was maybe already anticipated by you guys? Or was it incremental to your expectations? Or was it just kind of the Street model that may be a little bit wrong?", "Curt R. Hartman", "No, it's entirely incremental. The resignation occurred. You can't time resignations or build those into plans.  It's entirely incremental cost in the quarter, and it was previously disclosed. So it hits G&A. And when you do the math on the previously disclosed, it's about 40 basis points.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. I wasn't sure if that was acquisition-related or -- obviously [indiscernible].  That's helpful. And then just on MedSurg, can you maybe just give us an update on what you're seeing for hospital CapEx trends? You had commented that the U.S. medical beds business was a little bit softer that what you were anticipating. Is that something you think will persist?", "Curt R. Hartman", "It's a very fair question, and I probably should have provided a little color around that. U.S. medical results were disappointing, obviously, as you can look at our press release. I think it's more owing to internal issues than it is to external market issues. We had -- as Katherine commented, we've had some plant transitions going on. One of those involves production associated with our Medical business. In addition, we had some regulatory approvals and product launches that were a bit delayed beyond what we had anticipated, and that has also impacted our ability to ship and hit the desired levels in the first quarter. So as we enter the second quarter, we have higher expectations, though it does take time to recover some of those shipment delays and get production ramped back up when you're talking about something as complex as our medical bed franchise. So we have higher expectations as we enter the second quarter.", "Katherine A. Owen", "And Kristen, one follow-up I would make. Although Medical is the most -- the business most dominated by capital, there is significant capital component to both our instruments and Endoscopy businesses, and particularly with instruments and power tools, which is clearly capital, we're seeing very good growth. So it doesn't feel like there's any real issue from hospital capital budgets versus what might be more Stryker-specific issues in the short term.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Michael Matson from Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Based on what we've heard from some of the other larger med tech companies, it sounds like there has been a little bit of an uptick in accounts receivable, particularly in some of the European countries. So I was wondering if any of that increase of it we saw there was due to what's going on in Europe, particularly around the periphery.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, similar to some of the other comments that we've heard from companies, some of the Southern European areas have been a little bit more challenged, and it's contributed to our higher DSOs by about 3 days from the end of 2011. It doesn't feel like anything that isn't manageable right now, but it is part of what -- where the pressure is coming from.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then you all have said that you expect to offset the medical device tax in 2013. It sounds like that's mainly based on the restructuring programs you already have in place. But I guess I'm wondering why we're not sort of seeing the benefits of some of those things this year. And I'm also wondering if there's going to be additional restructuring required to hit that kind of 17% underlying earnings growth number that you need to offset the tax.", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think there's a couple of answers to that question. Number one, part of the offset to the med device tax will come from the restructuring initiatives that were announced in November of 2011. So that was 4 months ago. So I wouldn't anticipate that those restructuring efforts would be materially impacting our results at this point in time. It is possible that we will see some of that benefit as we get into the second -- later half of this year. Other components that we're counting on are the GQO initiatives, which Katherine started to provide a little more detail on in this call. And then finally, we are certainly banking on all the acquisition activity and new product innovation introduction being contributors to top line growth to also help offset that. So our model is not solely based on a restructuring action that's been announced as the thing that gets us over this hurdle. It's a combination of all of the above and then probably some other things that will happen just within the overall normal operations of our business at the -- as we unfold our plans heading into 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could comment on what your underlying growth in your core Spine business is. And any color there in terms of pricing and procedure volume trends?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, the environment in the spine market remains challenging.  It is one of the areas where we're seeing continued pricing pressure. I wouldn't say it's materially different from what we've seen previously. It is being offset by better gains for Interventional Spine business, but the traditional core Spine business remains under pressure when you ...", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So what was -- go ahead. Sorry.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I was going to say when you ex out the benefit they're seeing from the addition of the product offering from Orthovita.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. So -- I mean, are we still sort of -- in terms of organic underlying Spine growth ex-ing out acquisition, are we still sort of looking at sort of negative mid-single-digit declines? Is that kind of a fair assessment?", "Curt R. Hartman", "It's negative. I don't know if it's mid-single-digit negative.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, you talked about driving some mix benefit on your hip side of the business, and I'm assuming that that's coming from your ADM and MDM offerings. I was wondering on the knee side. How is mix looking there? We heard some commentary from a few other -- a couple of other companies that talked about revision procedures driving some mix in knees. Are you seeing any of that? Or any comment there would be helpful.", "Katherine A. Owen", "To your first comment, not in total. But certainly, ADM and MDM are a driver of that mix benefit. And just as we would expect Accolade to help going forward, we are seeing a mix benefit in knees but not to the same degree that the hip segment is seeing. And I wouldn't point to anything specific as it relates to revisions. That's just kind of the normal offering helping.", "Curt R. Hartman", "And I would say, Derrick, we are -- continue to be encouraged by the rollout of OtisMed. And that trend continues to increase month over month and is being with some level of enthusiasm at this point as we get more of the imaging centers up and installed and get to that further comprehensive approach out across the market.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Katherine, just make sure I understand what your -- the message you're trying to send across on the improvement in Recon performance. So your view is that the underlying market hasn't changed much, it's relatively stable 4Q to 1Q. But the improvement in your own business is a function of easier comparisons and an improvement in mix. Is that the message?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say we're cautiously optimistic, but too soon to say that we've seen a meaningful improvement or even a modest improvement in volume trends right now. And partly, it's because of the historic Q4 to Q1 seasonality anomaly that it's just -- it's tough to know. It certainly feels very stable from a volumes perspective, and perhaps the trend arrow is pointing upward. But we'll feel better when we see how the results in the next quarter and how they play out for the year. I think it's certainly benefiting from easier comps as well as the momentum now that we're kind of in that full rollout, ADM, MDM, getting traction with OtisMed. So the product traction is helping. It's helping with some competitive conversions. And it's helping on the mix side. So we're having a little bit less of a negative impact from a price-mix perspective as it relates to hips and knees, particularly on the hip side.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. I had 2 launch/mix questions. So one, you made some comments with regard to the mobile bearings, the mobile bearings systems that you guys now have out there. I think you said they were, in total, 21% of your U.S. hip cup mix during the quarter. Where do you think that can go?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Hopefully, higher. It's trending nicely. It's up 4 percentage points sequentially, and we're still out there pretty aggressively promoting the benefits of that. It's tough to know if you look at metal-on-metal. And the benefits were certainly, in large part, driven by the large head design, and the desire for that hasn't gone away. That peaked at 30%, 35%. Whether that gets to that degree with our business, it's kind of tough to know, but I would say that it's continuing to trend upward at this point. So I don't think it's flattened out yet at 21%.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Katherine, the Concentric launch, is that slightly delayed? When you said earlier 2012, 2013, is that -- does that represent a slight delay? And the TREVO 2 data, when should we should see that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, it's no change from the time when we acquired Concentric back in late Q3, I believe, where we said we were hopeful of a 2012, 2013 FDA clearance. So no change at all in the time frame there. Some of the Trevo device was released at one of the recent neuro meetings. But I'll -- Larry, I have to follow up with you offline to get more specifics around it because I don't have that in front of me.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "No problem. And Curt, just one for you. Just basically in this interim period, are you approaching anything differently from your predecessor?", "Curt R. Hartman", "No, I think going back to our original commentary, we're satisfied with the strategy that we have in place, and the company continues to execute on that strategy, both as it relates to our markets but also as it relates to our internal areas of focus, be it GQO or other shared service categories that we've been looking at or operational efficiencies. So I think the game plan remains very much sustained. Now with that said, there's always tweaks and adjustments, but we were making tweaks and adjustments quarter-on-quarter anyway. So we'll continue to run the offense and, as appropriate, adjust our plans where we see fit to take advantage of opportunities that may be presented.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I had a question on Japanese pricing. Can you discuss with us the biannual pricing or price declines that you're going to see in knees, hip and Spine? And I'm assuming that that's in your guidance for the rest of the year.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes. Glenn, I would qualify the answer a couple of ways. Number one, the pricing cuts were a little bit larger than we had originally anticipated, so somewhere in the aggregate around 4% -- a little more than 4%. But overall, to the expectations for our business, it's immaterial, and our full year guidance factors all that in. So I don't think we see it as a major event at this point in time. It certainly is for our Japan business as they adjust to a slightly larger cut than they originally planned for, but the breadth of the portfolio over there should give them opportunities to absorb that.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And is that 4% to 5% cut, that's across everything you sell there? Or is that just predominantly knees and hips?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I'm giving you one aggregated number for the Japan price cuts. Different segments have different price cuts, and I, again, I don't have that in front of me.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Matthew O'Brien from William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I just wanted to see if I'm looking at this correctly. From the press release, it looked like Recon pricing was down about 2.6% in the quarter. Is that a modest acceleration compared to the last couple of quarters? And what is driving that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Are you saying that the global Recon pricing down 2.6%?", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Yes, out of your release. I looked in the previous releases, and I didn't see it. But if memory serves, I think it was negative 1.7% or 1.8%.", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, that's a new level of detail that we included in the press release by segment just to give you guys a little bit more granularity. So it's not a number we released previously. The number you're referencing is total company price, which we've always reported.  It's just you're getting more segment detail. So no, there's no material change. And as I mentioned, it's actually a little bit more favorable when you factor in mix for hips and knees.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up question, on the neuro side, specifically hemorrhagic stroke. How is that business trending? What kind of growth did you see in the quarter? And then I can't see what it actually was, but how does that compare versus what you were thinking when you've initially acquired the business?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Well, keep in mind 65% of that -- of the Neurovascular business is outside the U.S. And so we look at the revenue breakdown between international and U.S. and we start looking at product rollouts, the Target Coil is the key innovation that, that business has been rolling through, and we feel very good about that. And internationally in the quarter, we had a very good quarter, which I think does directly reflect the success and acceptance of the Target Coil. In the U.S., our results were probably a little bit muted for our original expectations, and I think that's a reflection of the fact that we do not have a flow-diverting stent at this point in time. And customers are evaluating that technology, and that comes directly at the expense of coiling. That said, we still feel very good about our innovation pipeline in that business and feel very good about the Target Coil franchise. And we've got great customer relationships and great market shares across all the segments there. So as the year unfolds, we don't see any real material change in that business, and we do have some new products that are scheduled to be released here shortly that we're encouraged about how they will further impact that business this year.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "It's Steve Beuchaw here for David. I wonder if you could speak to some of the levers in the thinking in the revenue guidance. As we look at the results for the quarter and how the cadence -- the cost trend over the course of the year with this quarter around 5% growth in the top line excluding the acquisitions and currency, it seems that guidance is at least reasonably conservative. Now could you give us an update on what you're looking as the key levers in this -- at this point in the year driving expectations toward the higher or lower end of the range?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes. I guess first thing I would point to is we did have an extra selling day in the quarter, which would take that 5.2% down, as we said, on an absolute basis to 3.6%. So that's not 100% accurate because capital businesses are not as subject to the day variations that the procedure-based businesses are. So if you take the 3.6%, it's comfortably inside the 2% to 5% range we gave, maybe a little bias to the high end. And number one, it's one quarter. So if we're sitting here at the midyear and we've got a quarter that's outside or -- to the upside of the range, maybe we'll reflect a little deeper on our business segments and look at our guidance. Right now, I think with one quarter under our belt, no material change in what we would refer to as elective procedure volumes. We're comfortable with our range and the assumptions that go into it.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's helpful. I wonder, then, if you could touch briefly on the operating environment in Europe. Is it any tougher or easier in your mind than it was a quarter ago? And is that any more true on either direction, either in the capital or implant markets?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I don't think that from a Stryker perspective, we have found the commercial operating environment to be materially different in the first quarter than what we saw last year. Clearly, on the asset management side, we have seen a little bit of holdback on the payable side in Southern Europe. However, there are some things being tossed around in some of the Southern European countries around payment schedule in some of the markets for the midyear point, and we hope that, that materializes, and we're obviously very involved in that. Overall, the market remains pretty stable. And I did comment that at least within Stryker in our hip, knee and in other Reconstructive segments, we did have positive growth in the quarter, which we view as a good sign for our business and a good sign for the stability that we're starting to get in that business.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I had one area to follow up on, on recon. And I did have a follow-up on Spine. I'm wondering if you could give us any color, Katherine or Curt, as to what within Spine, is it product lines, the launches, introductions that you're looking to, to improve that product line over the next several quarters? And then -- or maybe what some of the weak spots have been? And then I have one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think it's been probably just the market. The overall spine market has seen lower volumes, and some of that is the recession-induced slowdown in elective procedures, but it's also payer pushback. So that is probably the overriding biggest factor.  Layer on top of that ongoing pricing pressure. Certainly, the comps help, and -- but that's hardly we want to be banking on. And we haven't done as well but better more recently on some of the new products that fill gaps. So I wouldn't view them as game-changers but necessarily to make sure we've got a competitive product offering. So it's first and foremost just a challenged market, but an area that we continue to believe has a lot of opportunity for innovation. So it's a segment we're committed to, just recognizing it is going to be one of the more challenged businesses that we have right now.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. I had one follow-up, then, on the Medical business line. You mentioned sort of some of that might have been self-inflicted. Any color -- I guess similar question -- color within that business line? Neptune? Stent? Anything you could tell us that could maybe help us understand that a little bit better?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think within Medical, what we're really looking at is more self-induced damage in the first quarter than anything else. And that comes from some of our transition plans that always seem to have more difficulty in them than one would like to assume. And then on the regulatory front, we had some new products that didn't quite get where we needed them to in the first quarter. But we still feel very encouraged about those and how they'll influence this year. And so I don't look at our Medical results in the first quarter with great alarm. I'm disappointed, clearly, and I think that the team over at Medical is disappointed, because they've been on an 8-quarter run, and this is not how they wanted to start their first quarter. And I have it on good authority from that leadership team that they have much different plans for the rest of this year. So I'm cautiously optimistic that the rest of the year will unfold in a much different fashion.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Curt, now that you're at the helm, where do you see, kind of net of price in the U.S. Recon as kind of the steady state that's achievable given the price pressures offset by the innovation ability?", "Curt R. Hartman", "So Bruce, when I -- I'm still the CFO, and when I get price questions, I usually deferred those to Katherine. So I don't know. You're kind of bumping that up to the interim CEO, which I know [ph].  But my view on price net of mix is probably no different than Katherine's. It's probably no different today than what it was 3 or 6 months ago. Innovation still matters. Our organizations are focused on innovation, be it internally developed or externally acquired. And I think to the extent that we keep the innovation focus on, that can benefit and offset some of the price pressure. There's nobody in our business walking around saying pricing pressure is going to change any time soon. We recognize that's part of the current day environment. We're not forecasting that to go away any time soon. And would we love price to change? Absolutely. But that's not what we're walking around thinking, and what we are thinking is that innovation still matters. We're seeing this in things like ADM and MDM, System 7, other products that we've introduced, the lateral approach out at our Spine organization. Innovation still pays. Customers still pay for great innovation. That remains somewhat the marching orders here.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And Katherine, just a follow-up for you. You -- reading between the lines, it almost sounded like you're -- you think you might have seen some green shoots with regards to volume. Is there anything substantive that you can comment on?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, and it really wasn't my intent. I certainly feel very good that the market is stable. But as we've tried to say in the past, with our implant business in particular and given the vagaries of the market right now, you really have to look at more than one quarter to get a true sense if there's been a change in the trend. So what -- are we hopeful that maybe trends get better? Absolutely. But at this point, it would just be too early a call to say anything other than certainly stable, and, hopefully, we're not going to go into an environment where we see any type of worsening in elective procedure trends that occurred, as everybody knows, in some of the prior quarters. So a high degree of conviction in stability, but not ready to say anything stronger than that at this point.", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think we've just overall found that we need to let the numbers do the talking versus us projecting, because it's just far too difficult to estimate where the markets are going. Every day, there's a new headline that seems to shake things up. And we've got a highly engaged selling organization, great product innovation. And we're just going to keep pushing on that and let -- ultimately, let the numbers materialize.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Richard Newitter from Leerink Swann.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Maybe I could just start off on the -- both the hip and the knee side. I -- you've talked about positive mix shift opportunities. Within hips, Accolade is coming up. Should we expect this to be as big of an incremental contributor as kind of the MDM, ADM launch? And in knees, just where are we in OtisMed? And how much kind of is there to go as we move forward?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think it's probably too early. Literally, the Accolade 2 launch is getting under way right now. And unlike ADM and MDM, it will cannibalize some of the original or first-generation Accolade sales. But obviously, our -- that group is focused on competitive conversions. And I think the uptake will be a bit quicker for the reasons we've pointed to and the familiarity with the Accolade platform. So certainly -- it's correct that we can't control the markets, but giving sales reps new products to sell is a big motivator in any environment. And OtisMed continues to see sequential growth, and very pleased with the ability to offer what is increasingly becoming an important product offering to have in that knee portfolio.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "And just maybe to follow up on that. Is OtisMed a mix driver for you in knees going forward? Is that one of the positive mix opportunities? Or is that more of a, I don't know, a market share gain potential driver?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think it's more in the market share side of things than anything else. We do charge for it, but it's -- I would view that more as a driver of market share.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Rajeev Jashnani from UBS.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I was hoping we could go back to, excuse me, Bob's question regarding operating margins. And I guess if you kind of take out the 40 basis points this quarter out of SG&A, you were still down year-over-year, albeit on a tough gross margin comp on the year-over period. But I was just wondering if could kind of talk about operating margin outlook for the entire year and whether -- I guess how we should be thinking about that on a year-over-year basis.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Certainly. Starting any year, the goals are to improve the ratio. So as we begin 2012, we're looking at every ratio, looking for opportunities of improvement. With that said, at the end of the day, we have an earnings target that we're trying to move towards. And we reserve that right to invest in the areas of opportunity, whether they be in Global Quality and Ops or whether they're in the operating expense category. So if the top line is improving, you should probably anticipate we're going to make greater investments in the selling expense line, which is going to, therefore, impact the operating margin. So we try to keep the absolute amount of flexibility that we can while continuing to move the business ratios forward in a responsible way. As we look at this year, I go back to my very first comment.  We're looking for improvement in all of our ratios. We do believe in letting the business roll up their results and make the appropriate investments locally, because they tend to make the best decisions. And as of right now, we still feel that there's opportunity, and we're still going to drive forward toward some improvement in the operating margin. I'm not going to give you a specific number on what we're targeting, specific percentage improvement or things of that nature. And then keep it in mind, some of this is also impacted, again, by acquisition work that does hit operating expenses. As it's first time in this year, it doesn't have a prior-year comparable.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Adam Feinstein from Barclays --", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "It's Matt for Adam. I just wanted to touch on some of these other questions that have been asked. But on this operating market target issue, you bought back some shares this quarter, but it really seems like you're just offsetting dilution. And it feels like you're comfortable with your level of investment. I guess, can you talk a little bit about the investment strategy and how you may be looking at it differently when your customer's focused on reducing costs and health care reform?", "Curt R. Hartman", "So on the first part of that, we did buy a few shares back. And it was a little bit later in the quarter, so they don't really materially impact the quarter. And frankly, it was intended to offset some of the dilution. So that's a fair and accurate statement. As it relates to our investments and trying to align those with our customers, it's absolutely spot on. The customer is evolving. They don't all evolve at the same point in time. You have some highly sophisticated customers who have a much different attitude and appetite in terms of the approach by companies like Stryker, and we're having to make some investments to ensure we align with their expectations. On the other side, there's a lot of health care systems that like the same approach they've always had, and we're not going to run away from that, either. So we're making the investments where we see the opportunity to move with our changing customer while at the same time ensuring that we don't leave any customers behind. And so I guess I'd just put that in the \"Do we retain flexibility to make the investments to address where our customers are going and recognizing along the way we may have to change some approaches and we may have to make some strategic investments to get our customers attention?\" And that's fine, too, because, again, if you've got -- if you have the right innovation walking in the door, if you have the right commercial approach walking in the door, there's generally a favorable reception. And we're doing those experiments to ensure we're on track with where our customers are heading.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And just to follow up. I know you typically don't break out emerging markets. But can you talk a little bit about the difference in growth between developed and emerging markets o U.S. and what you're doing there?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Sure. The emerging markets, we believe, are an important part of this company's future. And we have a new group president within the last 6 months who's responsible for international, and one of his first homework/assignments along with his team was to really dive in and evaluate what our current approach was versus what it may need to evolve to. And we're very encouraged by that work and what he and the team are doing. Today, when I look at emerging markets, you can come up with a long laundry list of countries. But I think places like China, India, Brazil, maybe you throw Russia, Turkey and a few others in the mix a little bit later, but if you start with China and India, we have a presence there. We've had a presence there for a long period of time. And our growth in those market is above the company average, and we anticipate that it should stay there. The real question is, is it growing fast enough, given the rapid evolution of those markets? And that's what we're evaluating. Do we have the right products? Do we have the right structure? Do we have the right approach? So I think our strategy here is to do a comprehensive review, take a hard look at what our investments are lined up to support, make adjustments where appropriate and ensure that at some point out in the future, we can really point to success in those markets and Stryker evolving and emerging to be a key market share leader in that space.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen and Company.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just quickly on the Neurovascular side. Can you just give us an update in terms of whether you're on track for transferring manufacturing responsibilities over from Boston Scientific? And just some directional color on -- in terms of how impactful that will be to gross margins for that unit?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes, the Boston Scientific Neurovascular integration to Stryker is, obviously, then and continues to be, a very complex transaction. But I think in the best spirits, both the Boston Scientific side and the Stryker side have put highly dedicated, high-performance teams on this, and we remain very much on track with the transition service agreements and the transfer. Keep in mind, there's the manufacturing in Cork, Ireland; there's manufacturing in West Valley, Utah; and a small bit of manufacturing out in Fremont, California. All of those platforms remain on track, and those will continue in the integration transaction.  We'll, probably not be complete until midyear 2013 based on latest plans and estimates. Obviously, that fluctuates and moves somewhat, because these are big projects that do have some variability. I'm probably not going to get into any of the color commentary around impact on gross margins. It's a little premature to talk about that right now given that we have not yet officially transitioned any of the manufacturing to Stryker.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then just a follow-up on the Spine business. I know it's been a short time since AAOS, but any color on your lateral fusion platform launch and traction there in the millions of invasive surgery market?", "Curt R. Hartman", "We're excited by the lateral system that we developed and are launching. We've -- it's been met with good enthusiasm, both from the selling organization and from customers. But to your point, it's very early, so I wouldn't say it's had a substantially meaningful impact on our Spine business at this point in time. But from a feedback and enthusiasm standpoint, I think our selling organization is engaged, and I think our customers who are getting exposure to it are finding that we have a nice offering. So we're encouraged.  I'll leave it at that.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Jason Wittes from Caris & Company.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "A couple of product-related questions. First off, for the Concentric acquisition, I assume most of those revenues that you have at this point are coming from Trevo, not from the Merci product?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes.", "Curt R. Hartman", "No, it's the other way around. Merci is the original device, and Merci has the broadest regulatory approval inclusive of Japan. And in addition,, Concentric also brought some access products and balloon catheter-related items that compromise sales. The Trevo device has CE Mark and is in sale in limited form in the European market.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, I misheard you.  I thought you had said that most of your revenues were coming from Europe at this point.", "Curt R. Hartman", "No, 65% of revenues comes from outside the U.S., which is inclusive of Japan, China, Latin American countries.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Is there a -- sorry, go ahead.", "Curt R. Hartman", "For total Neurovascular, not Concentric.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Is there a timeline expected for a Trevo approval in the U.S.?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes, that's late 2012, early 2013 that Katherine mentioned in her opening comments.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Curt, Katherine, just 2 quick questions here. As for the components of guidance, are you still expecting less than 3% growth in OI and -- or in orthopedic implants and 5%-plus in MedSurg, Neurotech at this point?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think at this point in time, we're sticking with our original guidance. I think it's the responsible thing to do. There's -- we all want to be optimistic that elective procedures will rebound, will return at some level. But again, we -- we'd rather have our numbers tell the story. And based on those numbers, if there are adjustments to be made from guidance, we would move in that direction. But we're not seeing that right now, and, therefore, we're comfortable with the original guidance we've put out across the segments.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And just on the pricing front, I know Japan was asked about. But now that you're breaking out ortho pricing and with the 4%, 5% cuts there, simple math would say next quarter, maybe sequentially, pricing gets down to -- down 3% or so in ortho. Would that be your expectation? Or is there anything maybe offsetting that? Are there ways to get some improvements elsewhere to offset that Japanese impact starting in April?", "Curt R. Hartman", "The Japanese impact will start in April. But again, the 4% to 5% comment was across all Japan products that are impacted by the price cut. And so when you look at our Japan revenue, a segment of that is hip, a segment is knees, a segment is trauma, right on down the line. So I don't think it's not going to have a super-material impact on overall hip or knee total company pricing. Certainly, it is dilutive to the overall pricing right now, but I don't think it's going to be material to the overall company's price to the extent that we need to make massive changes.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of William Plovanic from Canaccord.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "So 2 questions. First, just on the Medical. You talked about some of the issues being internal, and that being new products and supply. I was just curious if there's new products that you were expecting had gained approval and if those supply issues had been resolved.", "Curt R. Hartman", "The new products are approved, and we're very excited about those. And the supply issues, the majority have been resolved, and we are working forward on ramping up supply. It's one thing to get the process in place.  It's another to ramp the capacity up. But we feel good about the future periods here.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "And of the challenges you faced, was it more supply-focused or product issue?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I don't have the document in front of me, but I think it was a little bit of both. It was fairly equal contributions. That business has a couple of different components into it, so there was some supply in some components. There were some regulatory approvals in others.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just want to ask a follow-up question on Neurovascular. I think, Curt, in your prepared remarks or a response to one of the questions, you talked about competitive trialing of flow diverters having an impact on your business. Maybe just talk about where we are in the goal that you had lined -- outlined when you did the acquisition to get this business back toward end market growth.  And where do you see end market growth right now?", "Curt R. Hartman", "We still feel good about our progress towards that goal and feel good about not only the early innovation that was released there in the Target Coil, but follow-on innovation that's coming. And I feel pretty high degree of resolve that we're on track with our acquisition goals that we stated when we first announced the deal. And we -- I think similar to what I said in January, we see that overall market probably growing in the 7% to 9%. Obviously, you're doing a little bit of estimating, because a lot of the numbers are not publicly disclosed. But as we try to roll things up, we see it in that 7% to 9%, 6% to 8%. And again, the acute ischemic side is where the -- where we see the higher growth rates coming from.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And maybe as a follow-up on the P&L, I know in the last quarter you had talked about R&D as obviously somewhat cyclical based in where you are in certain projects, but a very good R&D spending. Last quarter, you think it grew kind of in the 4% range. In this quarter, up 1% in dollars after, I think, what was 8 quarters of teens or 20%-type increase. Tell us where are we in the R&D spending cycle and how should we think about that on a go-forward basis?", "Curt R. Hartman", "David, your comments are accurate. I would just remind you, the other thing I talked about in the first quarter was that all of the R&D spending related to the Phase II trials for the OA product out of Biotech, which had previously been included in R&D, had been turned completely off, and those dollars had been reallocated across the core business franchises. So on an absolute basis, dollar for dollar, it looks very similar, but we've actually put more dollars into our core R&D platforms because of the shutdown of the OA Phase II trial. So I think the dollars that you see are going to be -- it's going to be in that range on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Net result, the growth rate will be slower. And potentially, as a percentage of sale, it drops down. But it does not signal by any stretch a slowdown in our investments in innovation. It signals more a re-prioritization of some dollars that were in a Phase II trial for OA that are now part of our core growth platforms R&D.", "Operator", "Your next question is coming from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Most of my questions have been answered. But I want to just focus on 2 things. Can you remind us how many manufacturing plants you currently have? Because the number that you talked about in terms of adding new plants was a bit higher than I had calculated.", "Curt R. Hartman", "It's 31.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "31 in total? And you added 14, I think you said, with acquisitions?", "Curt R. Hartman", "No, 11. We've added 11. Included in those 11 are the 3 that are still yet to come over from Neurovascular.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And when you've finished, I would assume consolidation is part of the SG&A gross margin program here. What do you think this looks like in 24 months?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I don't think we're ready to go there. I think Katherine commented that we have 3 of them in process for closure...", "Katherine A. Owen", "Consolidation.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Consolidation, et cetera. Again, there's a bandwidth issue here. We're doing, on one side, absorbing acquisitions, at the same side trying to simplify our global manufacturing network while both have an overriding priority of doing absolutely nothing to disrupt the quality systems that we have in place and, in fact, continuing to try to elevate our quality systems each and every day.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would just add that I'd be surprised if over the next 24 months, there wasn't more acquisition activity. So it's -- there's going to be a push-pull here.", "Operator", "Your next question will be coming from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Curt, I just wanted to ask on buybacks just kind of general. Is that -- is any acceleration in buybacks included in your guidance at this stage?", "Curt R. Hartman", "No, our guidance does not include any additional buyback information or any acceleration, which is exactly how we started the year. And hopefully, as we now enter what I would call the third year of more consistent approach to buybacks, you understand that we try to be fairly opportunistic with where the market is and where we see the stock price and where we finally have the opportunity based on our U.S. cash position. And so you've got to have an authorization in place, you've got to have the market opportunity and you've got to have U.S. cash available to make it all come together. And we did what we thought was appropriate in the first quarter given all of those factors.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just to go back on the extra selling day, you said 1.6% mathematically, but it sounds like it's probably a little bit less than that, because you mentioned the capital business. So maybe, think about it as skewing more Recon and then, obviously, a little bit more in the Neuro and Spine side, too, right?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes, it's a -- those are very fair comments.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions in queue. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Curt Hartman for any closing remarks.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thank you, Derek, and thank you, everybody, for your time with us this evening and your questions. That concludes our first quarter call. We're very excited about our first quarter results, and we'll continue on the strategic objectives that we have laid out and that we've been committed to now for a number of years. I'd just like to remind everybody before closing that the conference call for our second quarter 2012 operating results will be held on July 18, 2012. I would note that, that is a Wednesday. Our calls are typically held on Tuesday. We're doing that because there's actually calendars with holidays. Take one day out of the closing process. So we want to make sure we give our teams around the globe appropriate time to reconcile all of our global results. So thank you, everybody. Have a good evening.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for joining today's conference. You may now disconnect.

Factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is in the exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2012 Stryker Company's Earnings Conference Call. My name is Chanel, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Curt Hartman, Interim Chief Executive Officer and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thank you, Chanel, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's second quarter 2012 earnings report. Joining me on the call is Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. In terms of the format for today's call, I will provide opening comments and then turn the call over to Katherine for an update on several key focus items. I will then cover the financials before opening the call up to your questions.", "Turning to our second quarter results, sales finished at $2.1 billion, up 3% as reported and 5% in constant currency, with the U.S. market increasing 7.7% while the international market was up 3.3%, excluding currency.", "Acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to our top line, yielding 3% underlying business growth. Importantly, across all 3 of our key segments, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotech and Spine, there were drivers of the sales gains. Specifically, U.S. Reconstructive delivered underlying growth of 7%, reflecting a 6% and 4% increase in hips and knees, respectively. While Trauma and Extremities advanced by 11%, absent the influence of acquisitions.", "Within MedSurg, instruments had another strong quarter with global constant currency growth of 11% and U.S. growth of 13%, underscoring the accelerating momentum from our fourth quarter 2011 launch of our System 7 platform. Finally, Stryker Sustainability Solutions posted a third quarter in a row of over 20% growth.", "Turning to Neurotech and Spine, solid growth across all the Neurotech segments, coupled with the Orthovita acquisition influence in Spine, helped to offset the continued downward pressure in the core Spine segment. Overall, we are pleased with the general performance across the numerous segments.", "However, as we have previously communicated, we did experience weaker results in certain geographies, particularly Europe, and to a lesser degree, Japan, as well as a decline in our U.S. medical results. With respect to the weakness we saw in Europe, it remains consistent with our expectations that we discussed earlier in the quarter. Looking ahead, we believe the outlook for our European business is aligned with current market realities.", "All told, collectively, the strength of our broad-based and geographically diverse revenue model was evident as we remain on track to deliver on our full year financial targets.", "Overall, our top line growth, combined with gross margin expansion and ongoing cost controls, translated into adjusted per share earnings of $0.98, up 9%. Encouragingly, our gross margin reflects a traction we are starting to see from our focus on global quality and operations. Recognizing these efforts are still in the early stages but nonetheless, underscore longer-term potential. And our increased focus on cash generation was also evident with Q2 cash from operations totaling $457 million, a marked improvement over Q1.", "With respect to the CEO search, the board continues its efforts, which as discussed previously, include reviewing both internal and external candidates. Although not possible to predict the exact timing, the board does anticipate a decision regarding a permanent CEO during 2012.", "As we look ahead to the second half of 2012, we are positioned to deliver on both our sales and EPS commitments, reflecting the collective benefit of a number of key new products across our various businesses. This, coupled with an ongoing focus on driving operating margin expansion through improved efficiency and cost controls, is expected to result in 10% or better per share earnings gains in 2012.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Curt. There are 2 topics where I will try and provide some details, including hip and knee pricing and elective procedure trends and an update regarding key new product launches.", "Starting with pricing, please note that the press release includes a breakdown of our sales growth by volume mix and price for our 3 key business segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine. As it relates to our U.S. hip and knee pricing, the overall trend improved again this quarter, with mix largely offsetting some pricing pressure. Although difficult to demystify, we view Reconstructive trends as stable to modestly improving as the market appears to be moving toward more normalized rates that are likely in the low-to-mid single digits.", "Our assumption for underlying full year global reconstructive growth of not more than 3% we believe remains reasonable, with the U.S. likely to continue to track north of these levels, partly offset by some softness in certain geographies such as Europe.", "Turning to the new product front, late in Q2, our Endoscopy division launched its latest-generation 1488 High-Definition Camera. The 1488 leverages its premium optics technology to deliver an image that is 52% brighter than the prior generation 1288, with 33% more lines of visible resolution.", "Combined, these attributes allow for significantly greater picture clarity, which, given the nature of minimally invasive surgery, is a meaningful benefit for surgeons. Beyond the image, the 1488 was designed with cross-specialty standardization, which allows for use in 9 surgical specialties by addressing the specific color and lighting needs of individual surgical procedures. As our sales force expectations surrounding the imminent launch of the 1488 strengthened during the quarter, we experienced a slowing of endoscopy sales, which is a typical pattern when we are very late in the product cycle. Given the considerable advantages and technological enhancements of the new camera, a deferral of purchases in Q2 was not surprising and reinforces our expectations for accelerating second half sales for Endo.", "Switching to instruments, with over 25% growth in U.S. heavy-duty power tools in Q2, we are clearly building momentum, fueled by the launch of our latest-generation System 7. 2012 represents our 30th year of innovation in power tools, and with 3 decades of experience, the institutional knowledge and expertise is evident in our market-leading product offering that addresses a broad spectrum of surgical needs, including reconstructive hips and knees, Trauma and sports medicine, CMF and Extremities, as well as Spine and Neuro. With a large, dedicated U.S. sales force, we are well positioned to build on the product enhancements offered by System 7. We are highly encouraged by our performance against recent competitive offerings as evidenced by the sequential acceleration in U.S. heavy-duty power sales.", "And during Q2, we expanded our System 7 offering with the launch of our next-generation, high-speed Precision Oscillating Saw that runs significantly faster than the prior generation while providing both increased cutting speed and accuracy. All told, we are uniquely positioned with the broadest offering of dedicated power tools and accessories in the market.", "Looking at our Reconstructive franchise, following the launch of ADM and MDM mobile bearing hip systems, during Q2, we rolled out our next-generation Accolade Primary Hip Stem. Building on the success of Accolade, which is our #1 cement-less stem globally, Accolade II offers an alternative stem design targeted at a broader range of anatomies that are increasingly evident as the average age of the implantation has declined. The launch, although in the early stages, is tracking ahead of our expectations and positions our Reconstructive sales force with another new product offering.", "On the knee side, we are roughly 2 months into the start of our direct-to-consumer advertising campaign, focused on the unique single radius design of our Triathlon Knee. Specifically, the Get Around Knee campaign highlights the fact that we are the only company with a knee system based on a circular point of rotation, which is the construct of a natural knee, and we believe its more natural feel has helped drive the success of Triathlon.", "We started the campaign in May, and based on the normal time frame from when a patient first presents to actual reconstructive surgery, it's typically about 3 months. As such, we would expect to have a sense of a DTC impact on our knee business and market share starting in Q3.", "That said, based on some of the metrics we are tracking, including web visits and hits to the Surgeon Locator, the Get Around Knee campaign messaging is clearly resonating and we are encouraged about this activity. At the end of the day, it needs to translate into Knee market share gains and it's too early to make that call.", "Separately, to be fully transparent, early in Q3, we did voluntarily recall globally our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular hip stem given the potential for fretting and corrosion at the modular-neck junction, which may lead to adverse local tissue reactions.", "As of June 2012, the reported rate of ALTR is less than 0.5% of patients with these modular-neck hip stems. And while the rates are low, under our quality system the decision was made to voluntarily recall the product. With 30,000 units implanted globally since launch in 2007, the revenue impact is not material, but we thought it was important to communicate the specifics surrounding the recall.", "Lastly, on the new product front, building on the success of a delayed 2010 Target Coil launch, our Neurovascular group has launched a new line of its smallest coil to-date, targeted at the hemorrhagic stroke segment. The Target nano Detachable Coil is the industry's first 1-millimeter coil and the only 1-millimeter and 1.5-millimeter complex-shaped coil. The small size, combined with its softness and shapes, allows physicians to treat patients with smaller aneurysms that were previously untreatable with conventional coiling techniques, and to be used in all coiling procedures as a finishing coil.", "Given that physicians tend to prefer greater coiling density since it allows for greater occlusion of the aneurysm, a small coil is an important competitive offering. With the strength of its broad-based hemorrhagic and ischemic product portfolio, combined with the recent additional product launches such as the Target nano, Neurovascular achieved another quarterly sales record.", "Finally, we continue to anticipate 510(NYSE:K) clearance of our next-generation stent retriever for the treatment of ischemic stroke potentially in the second half of 2012.", "Hopefully, these comments provide a greater perspective on our commitment to delivering continued innovation fueled by our ongoing investments in R&D, as well as highly focused M&A. And while not practical to detail all the products of the various divisions, the collective impact is a major contributing factor behind our ability to deliver on our commitment of 2% to 5% underlying revenue growth in 2012.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Curt.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thanks, Katherine. As noted, positive growth across our 3 segments underscored by stronger U.S. market performance delivered 2.9% sales growth on a reported basis and 5% constant currency. With respect to earnings, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $0.98, representing growth of 8.9% over Q2 of 2011. On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.85, an increase of 8% versus Q2 of 2011. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP EPS is provided in the tables accompanying today's press release.", "In reviewing the quarter, I'll start with a discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the second quarter, volume and mix contributed 4.4% to our top line growth. Acquisitions added 2.2% and currency decreased top line sales by approximately $41 million and decreased the company's overall reported sales growth by 2%. Company-wide selling prices declined 1.6% on a worldwide basis.", "Looking at our reporting segments, I will start with Reconstructive products, which represented 44% of our sales in the quarter. Reconstructive products include our Hip, Knee, Trauma and other Reconstructive lines. Our Reconstructive segment increased sales by 1.2% as reported and 3.5% on a constant-currency basis. Domestic sales drove our growth with hips, knees and Trauma and Extremities, all recording solid gains. Acquisitions added 11% to the U.S. Trauma top line. Overall, it's a nice performance for our U.S. Hip, Knee and Trauma and Extremities implant lines.", "Conversely, our international Reconstructive results were down 3.6% in constant currency, with Europe and Japan experiencing softness that reflects both the macroeconomic environment and the need for us to execute at a higher level.", "Next, I will turn to the MedSurg product segment, which represented 37% of sales in the quarter. For reporting purposes, MedSurg is comprised of instruments, endoscopy, medical and the sustainability solutions business. In total, MedSurg sales increased 1.7% as reported and 3.3% on a constant-currency basis. Results were led by a strong performance from instruments and another quarter of over 20% growth for our Sustainability Solutions business. However, in the U.S. market, medical was disappointing as predicted and Endoscopy initiated its new camera launch, which as previously mentioned, should set them up for strong second half.", "Looking at the second half and the full year, with continued momentum for instruments and sustainability solutions and an expected acceleration in Endoscopy, we think we have the parts in place to return to higher growth rates and achieve our full year goal of 5%-plus growth.", "Our final segment, Neurotech and Spine, which represented 19% of the company's sales, had a very nice quarter. Sales increased 10.1% as reported and 12.4% on a constant-currency basis. Acquisitions added 7.2% to the constant-currency gain, reflecting the performance of the Orthovita and Concentric acquisitions.", "Our Neuro, Spine, ENT, Interventional Spine and CMF platforms all generated double-digit, constant-currency growth, while Neurovascular recorded better-than-market growth on record-setting coil sales. Finally, core spinal implant sales remain challenge, while we continue to benefit from the Orthovita acquisition.", "I'll now turn to the income statement, beginning with our gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins finished at 68.1%, while adjusted gross margin finished at 68.2%. This represents a 40-basis-point improvement both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. The improvement reflects the positive influence of continued focus by our GQO organization, changes in sales mix and the weaker euro, partly offset by the previously mentioned price pressure and the impact from higher inventory charges. Individually, none of these items had a positive or negative influence of more than 50 basis points.", "Research and development finished at 5.5% of sales. Overall, the absolute dollar spend was consistent with anticipated levels as noted on our January call. Selling, general and administrative costs represented 39.1% of sales. Adjusting for restructuring and acquisition-related charges, as well as a $33 million OtisKnee charge, SG&A finished at 37.1% of sales. This represents a decrease of 90 basis points versus prior-year levels.", "Reported operating income increased 11% over prior year and was 21.1% of sales. Adjusted operating income increased 9%, while the adjusted operating margin improved to 24.1%, representing an increase of 140 basis points versus the prior year and 40 basis points on a sequential basis.", "Other income and expense reduced pretax income by $10 million in the quarter, in line with the first quarter. Components of this included investment income and interest of $13 million, offset by interest expense of $22 million. The company's effective income tax rate was 25.3% for the first -- for the second quarter of 2012, and this was in line with our expectations.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with just under $3.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, which was an increase of approximately $40 million from year-end 2011. As a reminder, we have $1.75 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet.", "On the asset management side, account receivable days ended the quarter at 58, which represented a decrease of 1 day compared to prior year. Key activity included the receipt of payment for the majority of pre-2012 Spain public debt. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 174, which was up 5 days sequentially versus the first quarter and 10 days against the prior year.", "Turning to cash, in the quarter we generated cash flow from operations of $457 million. Overall, it was a nice turnaround from our first quarter performance and we expect to see continued performance throughout the remainder of 2012.", "Finally, in the second quarter, we repurchased 700,000 shares for a total spend of $39 million. This brings our year-to-date total to 1.7 million shares and a total spend of $89 million. We currently have open authorizations totaling approximately $614 million.", "Overall, our second quarter has kept us on track with our full year goals and we remain comfortable with our initial sales and earning targets that we provided at the start of the year. Specifically, we anticipate sales growth of 2% to 5% for the full year, excluding the impact from currency and acquisitions, and we'll deliver not less than double-digit adjusted per share earnings growth.", "To facilitate your modeling, as it currently stands, we view consensus Q3 adjusted per share EPS as slightly aggressive, while Q4 appears somewhat conservative. Currency remains a headwind, and if rates hold near current levels, we would expect third quarter sales to be negatively impacted by approximately 2% to 3% when compared to 2011.", "Using current rates, the full year currency impact on top line sales would be negative in a range of 1% to 2% when compared to 2011, consistent with our original expectations.", "In closing, we expect to build on the results in the first half, maximizing the performance of the various acquisitions and continuing to launch new products, resulting from our ongoing investments and internal innovation.", "With that, we'll now open up the call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Rich Newitter from Leerink.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I just wanted to maybe start off on the MedSurg division. I appreciate that you -- it sounds like you have a number of growth acceleration drivers into the back half, particularly in instruments and endoscopy. But can you just talk about the expectation that you're going to return to at least 5% growth? Can you talk about what the assumption is there for the Medical division? Is that assuming a status quo or is there improvement embedded there as well?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. Thanks, Rich, and by the way, congratulations. So we'll get you off the call quickly. If you look back to what we talked about in the second quarter, we did see some reprioritization of hospital capital spending and a lot of that was around some of the requirements associated with the Affordable Care Act, and I think we signaled that starting back in the May time frame. That, obviously, doesn't impact all capital purchases equally, if you look at some of the trends that we're seeing certainly in instruments and based on some of the early read for Endoscopy. Our full year assumptions right now do assume we get back to relatively flat, maybe up slightly medical growth on a global basis that would imply that Q2 kind of bottomed. And based on everything we're hearing from our customers, that seems a reasonable assumption. If you combine that with the expected acceleration in Endoscopy in the second half of the year, as well as the continued momentum in instruments and obviously, very strong growth for Stryker Sustainability Solutions, we're comfortable with that 5%-or-greater underlying growth for MedSurg in total.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And just maybe on your comments around Europe and Japan, I believe that was mostly on the Ortho Recon side, can you just talk about the nonmacro-related issues that you referenced? You said execution may be -- have driven the weakness there. What are you doing internally? What initiatives are in place to improve execution there?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Thanks for being on the call, Rich, and again, congratulations. But relative to Europe, we've had a number of ongoing organizational changes that we are working our way through the right changes and the right structure moves to address where we see the European market moving to. And it's been a bit of a moving target over the last couple of years for us and part of that is external environment focus. But we have to be intellectually honest. Part of that is our failure to execute and we're still a little bit playing catch-up to where the market is going and where we think we need to be. And that was my reference to being better at executing. So we have a number of things that we're looking at relative to distribution channels, relative to the way we're organized, relative to the way we get new products through the regulatory process in a faster fashion. And no single one of those is going to change our outlook, but it's combination of all of those that we have to stay on top of and execute. And I feel that we have the right things in place and we're moving quickly to do that. There's no quick solution here. We've been working on this for far too long, frankly, and we just got to pay more attention to it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Mike Weinstein, JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Curt, just -- maybe let's just spend 1 minute on OUS Recon because the performance really changed from the first quarter to the second quarter. That's -- that probably, other than the bed business, which you had already highlighted, is what stands out here. So can we spend 1 minute on what you think changed from first quarter to second quarter, where I think first quarter you're up 2.5% and constant currency in this quarter, you were down 3.5%?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Sure. I think pointing to the earlier comments, Southern Europe, specifically, was very, very slow for us in the Reconstructive segment, hips and knees specifically. And I don't think that's unique to us. I think, perhaps, the way we were approaching the market and what we were doing with that organization as we were fairly inward-focused, we probably took our eye off the ball. And I think for us in the quarter, one of the surprises was Japan. We had a very tough year-over-year comparable, but I never want to use that as an excuse. We saw some -- pricing pressure hit in the second quarter in Japan, but we also saw some slowing in that market for us. That was probably the one that we didn't quite have our eye on, was Japan slowing. So Europe, again, it would be more Southern Europe. We saw good performance out of places like the U.K. But Southern Europe, we really had a shortcoming. And it gets back to my commentary about executing a lot better because I think certainly we lost market share in Southern Europe.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And if we characterize the tone maybe over the course of the quarter, do you feel like it got worse? Do you have that insight into either Europe or Japan, whether the business was healthy in the first half, weaker in the second half or is that being too granular?", "Curt R. Hartman", "That'd be a pretty granular comment, but I would go back to our -- some conferences early in the quarter where both Katherine and I talked about seeing a softness in Europe. And I think that initially was driven more from a macro perspective and things we were hearing from people on the ground. And then I think you couple that up with some of our own internal shortcomings, we probably fell a little further than we originally anticipated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Matson, Mizuho Securities U.S.A.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I guess I just had a question about your commentary around pricing in Recon. I just wanted to make sure that I heard you correctly. Did you say that your -- you had mix shifts that fully offset peer pricing declines, is that correct?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. If you go back to the prepared comments, what we've said was as it relates to U.S. Hip and Knee pricing, the overall trend did improve again this quarter, with mix largely offsetting some price pressure. And that was probably a little bit stronger on the Hip side versus knees.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then in your European business, for the portion of the slower growth that was driven by macro factors, was that pricing, volume or a combination of both? Or do you have any sense for that?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I would say the macro factors were more volume as it relates to Southern Europe, specifically. The broad European community is certainly a publicly funded health care system, and there's a lot of overall funding pressure, in general, which has the potential to translate into further pricing pressure. But I think as we look at this quarter, it was more volume-driven as some of the Southern European markets really pulled back on procedure volumes, at least to the information that we had in hand.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So just back on Europe a little bit as it relates to hips and knees. Obviously, we've seen J&J and BioMed and there wasn't much commentary around significant weakness in Southern Europe. And so is it fair to characterize this shortfall in Europe from your perspective as the large majority of it being share loss by Stryker rather than a market issue given what we've seen from J&J and BioMed?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Not everybody has reported, but at this point in time, I think I'd be hard-pressed to say we didn't lose share.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then 2 other quick things. I just wanted to talk a little bit more about the bed business and your confidence in the guidance for the back half of the year. Because the comps don't get a lot easier in the near term and so I'm just wondering at this point, given how much volatility there's been in that business, what specifically gives you that confidence that you'll see the kind of rebound that you're projecting?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. Thanks, Bob, it's Katherine. I think a couple of things. We've obviously gotten a lot closer to our customers and really making sure we're listening to what we're hearing, looking at some of the trends on some of the products and also some of the comments we get back in terms of where they're at in their reprioritization and some of the investments they've had to make. So when you total that all up and we adjust that against our forecasting, that's where we get to a comfort level. You can never take the risk of a capital slowdown off the table, but I think we're much better attuned to staying closer to our customer certainly since '08 and even more so since the first quarter.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And is core Spine still down mid-single digits?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I'm sorry, Bob, is the...", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Was the core Spine business, the metal business, is that still down roughly mid-single digits?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, that's a good approximation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ms. Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just kind of on the cash improvements that you had in the quarter, I was just a little surprised that you didn't buy back more stock. Can you just maybe remind us your view on just kind of why you're not repurchasing more shares? And then also, would you be -- I guess, would the board consider also increasing the dividend as well?", "Curt R. Hartman", "So 2 questions there, Kristen. We didn't want to get too far out in front of ourself given our lack of cash generation in the first quarter. And when we budget our uses of cash over the course of the year, we look at our dividend increase, we look at our other allocations that go into our annual plan. We, first and foremost, try to keep those in mind. We look at share repurchase as the combination of events: what is the market opportunity; what do we feel or how do we feel about our current cash generation in future periods; and what other potential applications do we have for cash. So again, in our priority, it's M&A first and then cash and -- repurchases and dividends. We came into the year with a dividend increase of 18%. We tend to look at our dividend on an annual cycle, so I doubt you would see any movement in our dividend rate during the course of the year, that tends to be an annual event. And we still have a very large open authorization on share repurchase, and it's just a matter of balancing all the different things that we're pursuing. The stock was pretty stable in the second quarter and really didn't fit in what I would call the window of what we saw as the right opportunity more than anything.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then gross margins, it was the first quarter in a while that we've seen some level of expansion. Can you -- I guess, how sustainable should we look at kind of gross margins from this level or can we expect to see additional improvements? I know currency does tend to impact that line. Maybe just kind of give us a sense on where we should expect margins, gross margins for the rest of the year to trend?", "Curt R. Hartman", "It's a great question and a fair question. I think going back to the beginning of the year, we said gross margins would in the year, finish right around that 68%, a little bit north. And I think we still feel very confident that in spite of some of these different movements -- tried to highlight all of the different things that moved in the quarter and the fact that no single one of them had more than 50 basis points of influence on gross margins. And I do think we get more stability in gross margins with each passing day under the global quality and ops organization as they get their arms further around all of the different pieces and continue to work on a consolidations of vendor management, the cost reduction activities, all of that plays into more stability in our gross margin outlook. And so nice to see the 68.2%. I think as we look to the future periods this year, we should be hovering right around that range and we'll see what other things may come up to move that one way or another, but we certainly have a lot of focus on it right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Jason Wittes of Caris.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to ask again about Europe and Japan. Can we assume that -- you talked about execution, you've given us some color. But has there also been some changes in distribution? Have you lost some distributors to competitors, things like that, that occurred during the quarter?", "Curt R. Hartman", "There were no changes in -- no material changes in any distribution path in Europe for Stryker during the quarter.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So strictly, execution as you said originally, okay. One last follow-up question. And that is looking at the bed business, looking at your Endo suite business, some of the hospital administrators that I spoke to seemed to be delaying some purchasing and waiting to see what SCOTUS' final opinion was going to be. Now that that's come, do you -- has there been any change in purchasing or is that just something that hasn't really impacted at least your outlook for the year at this point?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think certainly in the short term in the second quarter, it may have had perhaps a little more influence on the medical side. Those are generally, Jason, very large purchases because of the cost point. On the Endoscopy side, I certainly could not tell that by the incoming order trend.", "Jason Wittes - Caris & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. But then just a follow-up, though. So part of the reason you think the bed business should improve would be at least -- at least part of the reason for the slowdown in bed this quarter is at least partially due potentially to SCOTUS, is that a fair characterization?", "Curt R. Hartman", "That's a really granular characterization, so I don't want to put too much weight on that. I think it's a combination of factors. It was partially driven by the implementation of IT systems that they were getting reimbursed for, based on implementation and effectivity. And they had some hard deadlines that I believe hit the first week in July. And those system implementations require the same people that work on big bed installs. So it was a matter of priorities. I think there was potentially some hesitation because of expected reimbursement that hospitals were supposed to get out of the Affordable Care Act, and if that went away, they may have to rethink some of their priorities and limit some of their investments. So it potentially has good news now that we're past that point. But I think we'd rather see that play out in the quarters ahead than make a proclamation that that's going to be what materially happens.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Bruce Nudell of Credit Suisse.", "Matthew Keeler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Matt in for Bruce. First, on -- you said Neurovascular grew ahead of the market in the quarter and I was just curious if that's something you think is sustainable going forward?", "Curt R. Hartman", "We had set out when we announced the transaction that in year 2, we intended to get to market level or above growth rates. We have had a very good new product cycle since day 1, and that was further supplemented in the second quarter with the nano coil that Katherine mentioned, as well as a few other products that are very beneficial to that organization. In addition, we just hit the 18-month mark of the integration, so a lot of the work is getting pretty long in the tube. And so all of those things line up to provide an opportunity for better performance. So as I look at the NV business in the second half of this year, all of that, plus other things that we're focused on potentially the approval of the stent retriever device, things of that nature, give me confidence that we can continue to grow at or above the market here.", "Matthew Keeler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess just changing course, can you maybe talk a little bit about your emerging markets exposure in Recon and what the opportunities are there to increase your exposure in that business?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think -- you've got a lot of background noise. I think, in general -- can we ask you to put your phone on mute? So the question was relative to emerging market in Recon, what's our exposure. I think just very high level, if you look at the company, our percentage of revenue that's outside the U.S. is out of line with broader medtech. So number one, it implies that our international opportunity is larger than the majority of medtech, and certainly, as you cascade that through the various key growth drivers in the international markets like India, like China, we have a large opportunity there. We will be deliberate in our movements there. We will ensure that we have the right products and that we have the right structure to advance and get our share of that market. And it certainly is an area of focus for the company. It's -- it is one area of focus. There are many areas of focus. But certainly, emerging markets needs to play a bigger role in this company's future in the years ahead.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Matthew Taylor of Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. Could you give us an update? You talked a little bit in the past about your plans for offsetting device tax next year with the restructuring and still being able to hit those double-digit EPS growth targets. Can you give us kind of an update on that and bigger picture thoughts about what you'll be able to do there to get some leverage to offset that pressure?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Sure. Great question. We're about 80% through the restructuring that we announced in late 2011. And as some of the original plans across our various businesses have been continued to be evaluated given where those businesses are, we're slowing some of those down. And as we look at some of the changes on a macro picture, there are other areas where we're increasing and doing more to reflect the new reality, so to speak. So we're about 80% through the restructurings that we had announced in terms of plans being actionable and moving forward. We certainly have not received the benefit to that extent in the P&L. So I think we're in pretty decent shape relative to the original restructurings we laid out. The other parts of our ability to address the med device tax were continued innovation, the accretion that we expect to receive in most of our deals beginning in year 2 and year 3, and we're now getting to year 2 and year 3 on most of those deals. I think we'll have one deal outstanding after the end of the third quarter, and that would be Concentric, which closed in October of last year. So we'll start to get most of our deals into the year 2, year 3 period, where they add more value to the earnings line. And ongoing focus on internal innovation and internal efficiency through things like the work of a global quality and ops group. We believe all of those still put us in a good position to achieve the goals that we said we were going to achieve in 2013.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And just a follow-up on Endo, could you give us a sense of size for that -- the launch in terms of your ability to reaccelerate growth there?", "Curt R. Hartman", "When you say the sense of size, what do you mean?", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just -- as the percentage of sales or I guess how much order flow was held back in the quarter in anticipation of the launch?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Sure. I may not get into real specifics here, but if you think about the Stryker Endoscopy business, the 3-Chip Camera is the engine that pulls that train. And it not only has the ability to be sold as standalone camera system, but it's integral to the Endo suite concept, which is the bigger ticket item out of that business. So when that selling organization, that customer base are aware that there's new, substantially improved technology coming, that business slows down dramatically because number one, we don't want to sell our customers yesterday's technology, and we're in this for the long-haul. So we're patient with our customers and we'll wait to get that new technology out. And now that we have that out, and really started that late in the second quarter, we feel very good about how that will help reaccelerate that business, not only in terms of direct selling of the camera, but items that are related to the camera, broader Endo suite sales, light sources, the SDC3I solution for data management, all of those products that go around that should benefit from the introduction of that new camera.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ms. Joanne Wuensch, BMO Capital market.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Tax rate for the year, can you give us an idea of how to look at that? It looks like your tax rate was a little bit lower during the second quarter, which may have helped you out by a bit, a $0.01 or $0.02 by our calculation?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think we said the tax rate for the year, we thought would be 25% with a little bit of downward bias perhaps. You've got to keep in mind a lot of the different things that are not in that tax rate right now like the tax extenders. Every company is dealing with that, so that's an upward bias on the tax rate. And the company continues to execute on projects and programs that should lower the tax rate, so we're trying to neutralize some of those things. But I think we still see our tax rate being in the 25% with a little bit of downward bias.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then are there any new products that we should be looking at in Trauma and Extremities? The Memometal, forgive me if I mispronounced that, transaction closed last July. Memory is that you had some products in there that were coming on schedule this year.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes, it's the Memometal or MMI transaction that closed, and that's really focused on the extremities markets, specifically the podiatry market. They had a very nice product offering to add to acquisition and they had a host of other items in the pipeline. I would tell you that business is still relatively small and is probably not going to move the needle overall on Stryker, but it's certainly a key strategy of building our extremities markets. And we like the traction we have with that and how it's introduced to a new customer. They have been introducing some new products this year and we'll continue to put emphasis on innovation there because we think there's a lot we can do with the technology and in the hands of a much larger selling organization at Stryker. No specific product line introduction that I would point you to, but more of a Stryker focus on the extremities market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. David Roman, Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Curt, I was hoping you could maybe help us out as we think about the P&L. When I -- when we sort of take a look at operating leverage, this quarter, you generated 5% constant-currency growth and 9% earning -- adjusted earnings growth. Is that sort of the right type of earnings leverage to top line growth we should think about? Or is it really to think about the 2-ish percent organic growth leveraging to 9% earnings? How do you think about the differences in there, kind of ability to generate earnings leverage?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I would definitely be looking at the 5% to 9%, and I would tell you that historically speaking, over time, the higher we can drive that 5%, the more leverage and space that we can get. We have a pretty good track record of doing that. And from an opportunity within the company and all the global quality and ops opportunity and even some of the back-office harmonization the company is trying to work its way through, that should increase our capabilities there, at least keep them sustained and allow us to make other investment decisions in other emerging areas. So I view this quarter as the 5% and 9%. And benefiting from some of the work that we've been focused on now for several quarters.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I was just hoping you could clarify one thing on gross margins. I think in your prepared remarks, you said you gave 4 factors that influenced gross margins: 2 positive, a weaker euro and sales mix; 2 negative, higher inventory and pricing pressure, none of which had more than a 50-basis-point impact on the GM [ph] line. Of those 4, which of those are sort of this quarter phenomena and which of those do you kind of view as kind of part of the business on an ongoing basis? And then how would that influence the long-term gross margin trajectory?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Well, certainly, you could argue that the sales price issue has been an ongoing issue now for many quarters, so you could call that kind of part of the norm, kind of the underlying. I would say in the quarter, the inventory charge was probably a little bit out of sorts given the recall information that Katherine talked about. Because when you pull products from the market, you're taking an inventory charge associated with that. So that one was probably not in the original plan but we were able to deal with that. So those are the type of things that are -- it'd be improper to call it a one-timer, but it's just the reality of running the business. And you have to be able to adjust and absorb those type of things. The GQO benefits, we expect to see those continue to materialize, but again, a lot of the GQO work is predicated on the right quality systems steps and those generally take investments before the benefit materializes. So they're not necessarily quite as smooth quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter. We'll tend to get some good news, make some more investments based on that good news, little bit period drags on, get some more good news. And that's the offense we're trying to run there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Curt, just kind of a more macro wrap-up question here. If you think about this quarter and so far this year, you've got gross margins now trending in the right direction, maintaining guidance kind of top and bottom. Historically, you've been willing to provide sort of the Stryker outlook for the future, which I think was your comfort with double-digit growth heading into next year, even with the tax. I mean, if you think about kind of where you stand 6 months into the year, is that still an outlook that you're comfortable with?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Yes, we're absolutely comfortable with the outlook that calls for not less than double-digit earnings growth, both this year and into next year and until we state otherwise, probably future periods. The macroenvironment certainly continues to be very dynamic. I think everybody if we look back over various scripts from not only Stryker but other companies, we would have assumed that 2009, 2010, how much worse can Europe get, and here we are in 2012 and it continues to get worse. There hasn't been a headline -- or there's been more headlines in the last month about slowing GDP in places like China, where 2 years ago nobody thought China could slow down. So I think it's a very dynamic global market. And as long as we feel like we have the opportunity to continue to maneuver and deliver on that double-digit earnings, we're going to continue to make that claim. If that changes, you will hear it first from us because we want to be as in front of these things as we possibly can.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Very good, it's very clear. And then, Katherine, just a very quick one. If you think about pricing, we've heard most of the Recon players talk about a slightly improving pricing environment so far this year, or at least first quarter to second. Do you think the pricing that you saw slightly improve, do you think that's coming from more price stabilization or just your improving cadence and mix?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Well, the pure price we talked about seeing modestly improving or continued improvement in that trend, so that's pure price, although just -- I would keep in mind, we're not talking hundreds of basis points here. The mix contribution has gotten more significant, and I would point to, particularly in our Hip side, some of the new products that we've talked about like ADM, MDM, and more recently, Accolade II.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mr. Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So just to follow up on this -- the question that we've gotten so far on price, you entered this year, I guess, with more concerns, at least in the investor community, around pricing trends in ortho and it now sounds like, for whatever reason, that is not quite as bad as most people feared and maybe in some cases getting just a touch better. I'd love to understand what you think is happening, just sort of facilitate that and then I have one follow-up.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Matt, I think there are a couple of things. I would not want to send the message to anybody that there's not price pressure in ortho, because there is. I think one of the differences now versus, say, 2008, 2009 is companies have a much different innovation pipeline because, recall, we had a big issue across the industry with the DOJ investigations. Stryker, specifically, had a big issue from an R&D standpoint related to our quality remediation period. And I think our ability to get back on offense with innovation has helped drive price or at least to offset some of the bigger headwinds of price. So I think that's a change for us. I can't comment on our competitors and what they're doing. I just think our position might be slightly improving, though it's still a negative price environment because of some of the innovation and other solutions that we are offering as a company today versus 24, 36 months ago.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then you talked a fair amount, I appreciate the color on what has been happening in Europe and in certain geographies. But in Southern Europe, for example, where you think that you have lost some share, can you give us a sense of how long it takes -- we should think about that, taking you to get back on track there? Is this just a couple of quarters, is this 3 or 4 quarters? Is this a quarter? Any kind of color as to what you think we can expect would be helpful.", "Curt R. Hartman", "It's a great question. I wish I could definitively pin it down. I would tell you, we feel good about what the leadership team is doing. The proof will be when we deliver the results. We have taken a pretty harsh view of our expectations here and tried to set the bar really low to make sure we don't provide any negative surprises. And I would hope that by the end of this year, we've found stability and that we have found a way to get back on offense. Could it happen quicker? Absolutely, but I think we need to be conservative here because the reality is there's still a lot of macro issues in Europe that are going to change that environment. And we have to be prepared to address those while setting our business approach to meet that new reality.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I wanted to turn attention to the -- your U.S. performance in hips and knees for a moment. Both J&J and BioMed had reported their quarters, and I think that their results showed a bit of an acceleration relative to where they were in Q1 and their commentary suggested maybe improving utilization trends. Wanted to get your color, commentary on kind of what you're seeing in utilization? And also, the fact that your sales were sort of stable relative to Q1, might you be losing some share there or what are your thoughts on that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, a few thoughts. Again, we've all got different year-over-year comps, and so that's going to obviously influence the growth rates. And I would point again to some of the comments we made on the call in terms of the utilization trends, appearing to be stable to modestly improving and moving towards more normalized rates that are likely in the low-to-mid single digits. So we feel pretty comfortable that we're building on the momentum, particularly on hips from a new product standpoint. And then knees, we'll wait and see how much impact the Get Around campaign has, but as we talked about, we're pretty happy with the initial read.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess turning to your more CapEx-oriented businesses, obviously, bed's but a little bit of the other MedSurg businesses. I guess thinking forward a little bit forward to 2013 and the 2% sequester cuts that are going to be happening then, has that issue come up as a discussion point with any of your customers? Do you think that, that is going to impact hospital CapEx spending, either pulling forward or affecting CapEx budgets next year?", "Curt R. Hartman", "I wouldn't want to make a political statement, but would certainly hope that folks in Washington, D.C. can find a way to resolve a number of the looming budget issues that are out there. And whether that happens pre- or post-election, we'd like to see some movement there to get a little more predictability and certainty into the market. We've not had a lot of feedback on sequestration and cuts related to investments in health care. In all candor, I think the 2% is somewhat in line with historical cuts, so it's not like it's 2% historically going to 5%, 6%, 8% or 10%. So I don't think we've seen a lot on that side. And then keep in mind, Derrick, a lot of our capital outside of beds is really what I would call essential operating capital. You don't do hip or nee surgery without a power tool. You don't do general surgery without a camera. They're not million-dollar investments. These are 5s and 10s of thousands of dollars, so they're very different category of capital.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rajeev Jashnani of UBS.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on Derrick's question, and I was just wondering if you could expand on -- I know Stryker, typically when things are good, you'll attribute it to the market and when things are bad, you'll attribute it to share given you don't have full visibility at the time you report. But maybe just a little bit of color on the U.S., whether you think you gained share, update of new products, that would be helpful.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Again, it's a little bit difficult because everybody hasn't reported yet. I think based on where our U.S. numbers are, it's 6 and 4, and then our expectation that the total market's probably growing somewhere in the mid-single digits, we feel pretty comfortable about where we're trending. I would on the Hip side, again, point to ADM and MDM. And the most recent one, Accolade II, with some of the key product highlights that we're seeing there and then really leveraging the unique characteristics of the Triathlon Knee as it relates to the DTC campaign we discussed. So as we've said before, whether you're gaining a market -- or gaining or losing share in Recon, you really need to look at a few quarters of trends to get a full read, and we feel pretty comfortable with where our position is on that.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And I have one follow-up just on the P&L, specifically on the SG&A. I was just wondering, going forward out to 2013, is negative SG&A something that's reasonable for a company like Stryker? Or given the dynamics of your business, is that not really a thing that you're able to do?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Well, I think certainly companies can do -- you control your discretionary spending, of which the majority of SG&A is discretionary, outside of employee compensation. And even to some extent, that's discretionary to the extent you control your headcount. Our single biggest line in SG&A tends to fall in the selling category, which is a host of things. It's not simply selling compensation. And to the extent that we get more efficient in our organization, we ought to be able to reduce or put controls around our SG&A expansion. But I would also tell you that some of that change in SG&A may go into feeding other categories like more R&D, or selling organization expansion into different markets like Trauma and Extremities or expansions of some of our existing organizations that have new product portfolios. So is it a realistic expectation? I think people can do it if they want to and need to. I think we tend to look at the totality of our P&L and say where do we want to expand and what areas do we need to cut to make that expansion possible?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Glenn Novarro, RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I had a question on the modular neck recall. Katherine, you said it was not material. Are you saying this because it's your expectation that surgeons move to your more standard necks and not move away from Stryker to a competitor. So in other words, no loss of business? And then I have a follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, Glenn, I'm really saying it more from the standpoint if you look at global sales since we launched 5 years ago, it's about 30,000 units. About 20,000 of those are in the U.S. You take that relative to the size of our total Reconstructive business, it's just not financially material, either to the Recon business or certainly to total Stryker. And then yes, we've got some products that we're getting good momentum on like Accolade II. So there's obviously options, not modular, but other options available. So it's really just from the standpoint of how much the overall revenue contribution had been.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And just a follow-up on the modular market. Our due diligence tells us, at least in the U.S., maybe modular necks are 15%, 20% of the market. Can you confirm this? And then I'm wondering, do you think the modular market declines dramatically now, similar to what we saw from metal-on-metal when we had those issues years ago?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, and I think it's fair to point out, particularly from the patient perspective, the issues with the modular recall are really around fretting and corrosion and they're different from the metal-on-metal. So I would hate to put the 2 in the same category. I don't think we can speak to the total revenue because there's other players in this market where we don't have granularity around their numbers. Clearly, for us, it's nowhere near that percent of revenue for our business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Larry Biegelsen, Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just let me start with a question on Spine. Your comment earlier, core Spine being mid-single digits. Can you give us a little bit of color on what you're seeing in the Spine market? Has there been any improvement? I think it was a one -- your Neurotech and Spine business is one area where pricing did get worse. Was that primarily Spine? And kind of what are your expectations for your own Spine business? And I just had one quick follow-up after that.", "Curt R. Hartman", "I think in the core Spine market, we continue to struggle and some other large, established players continue to struggle. But clearly, there are some folks in the core Spine market who are growing their business. So it's a combination of a little bit tougher market and we need to do a little better job on the innovation side. I like where our leadership team is taking the business. I'm encouraging them to move quicker and faster, and we need to get back on a growth track with this franchise. And we have a long history of growth here and I think we have the wherewithal to get back on a growth track. Pricing in that segment was principally driven out of the core Spine business. So I think that kind of covers your question there, Larry.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, perfect. And Curt, just quickly on the P&L, do you guys have an active hedging or is it just passive hedging? Just -- could you remind us what you said about kind of the FX impact on earnings?", "Curt R. Hartman", "So we do not have a total P&L hedge program in place. We hedged certain preestablished obligations and we do a net hedging program across the company on a monthly basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Jeff Johnson, Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Curt, wondering if I can go back on your U.S. Hip and Knee business. In one of the questions, you stated maybe that your Hip and Knee business in the U.S. was stable this quarter. It looks to me, if I adjust for the extra selling day from last quarter and that had actually may -- might have picked up 100 or 200 basis points. And I don't want to parse numbers too much, but just on a day selling rate, did you feel like things got better in the second quarter versus the first quarter?", "Curt R. Hartman", "Jeff, we feel good about what's going on in our Hip and Knee business right now, and it's a combination of things that we've talked about. The innovation that the selling organization has in terms of hips, OtisMed on the Knee side, the DTC campaign, the organization is clearly back on offense. We've got a lot of items to talk to our customers about, and that all points in a very favorable direction. Now at the end of the day, the numbers are going to tell the story, and we've made some investments here in DTC. And to Katherine's earlier comments, we'll hope to see that materialize starting in the third quarter. But we're excited about the new product offering on the Hip side with Accolade II. The fact that the dual mobility solutions have now been out for a while, customers are getting comfortable with those. And we like the leadership team and we like what that organization is doing right now and it's great to see.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "All right, great. And then just a follow-up question on the modular side. And I know it's a small issue for you guys, but do you feel it was a product design-specific issue with your Rejuvenate, maybe DII or -- as we look at things, it really looks like the whole class of dual taper anyway, not necessarily all modular stems, but the dual taper designs may be at risk of those fretting and corrosion issues. I mean any thoughts there?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, Jeff, I don't think it would be appropriate for us to comment on a whole class. All we can speak to is what we've seen. The rates are very low at 0.5%. But as we mentioned, under our quality system, we thought it was reasonable to have a voluntary recall. We're still evaluating what the factors are around the adverse local tissue reaction. It would be premature at this stage to say we've figured out all the variables with any specificity, so we'll continue to work with leaders in the medical community and track it. But I certainly want -- wouldn't want to make a comment anything beyond what we're seeing here at Stryker.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mr. Steven Lichtman, Oppenheimer & Co.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Curt and Katherine, on M&A potential, just given your strong balance sheet, I was wondering has enough time passed since the bolus of acquisitions that you guys did over the past 2 years that you feel you can be more aggressive on deals and be able to digest them? Obviously, the right deals have to be there, but is it fair to say maybe you guys cooled off a little bit after a lot of deal flow in '09 through '11?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, I would point to our prior comments. Obviously, BD isn't linear. We commented before that we had a pretty hefty pace and we wanted to make sure we were integrating and executing on those to maximize the returns of those deals. Obviously, though, with our balance sheet and size of our organization, we are able and capable to do additional acquisition. Timing is always difficult to predict, so we remain busy on that front, evaluating and looking at different options. Whether or not that translates into executing on the deal, really isn't possible or, obviously, appropriate to predict right now.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And then just on Accolade II, obviously, you hope to take unit share. But should we be thinking of it, at a minimum, as a potential mix driver, is it priced at a premium and did it have any impact yet in that second quarter?", "Katherine A. Owen", "We did launch it during the second quarter. As we mentioned, we saw more of a mix benefit in our hips business offsetting the pricing pressure, and that would be one -- just one of the components.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Mr. Bill Plovanic,  Canaccord.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "So just -- it's just one more question on the Rejuvenate, if I may. If you look at this hip recall, I think 0.5% is 150 out of 30,000. And I guess, so that's a small number, so even if there is something major, it's still a small number. One, have you taken the charges that go along with that for any future liabilities? And two, have the sales force, have they spent the time and kind of gotten all the inventory out of that field or is that something that'll occur in the third quarter? And that's it.", "Curt R. Hartman", "So second question first, I think we feel very good about our execution of the recall, and don't view it at this point as anything that will materially impact our selling organization's efficiency. As it relates to potential future liabilities, we have not booked any reserves for those and it would be inappropriate to do so under the accounting rules until something is presented. And we do appreciate the reference because it is a very conservative position we've taken, but under our quality systems, we view it as the right position to take out of a long-term respect for the market and our position in the market.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions. I'd now like to turn the call back over to management.", "Curt R. Hartman", "Okay. Thank you, Chanel. And in closing, we want to remind everyone of our Analyst Day, which will be held on September 5 and 6 at the Homer Stryker Center in Mahwah, New Jersey. Formal invitations and details are forthcoming. Finally, the conference call for our third quarter 2012 operating results will be held on October 17 of 2012. We thank everybody for your participation tonight, and we look forward to talking to you soon. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the presentation.

My name is Larisa, and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President, Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. Joining me is Dean Bergy, our Interim CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "In terms of the format for today's call, I will provide opening comments and then turn the call over to Katherine for details regarding our recently announced planned acquisition of Trauson. And then Dean will cover the financials. We will then open the call to your questions where we will be joined by Tony McKinney, our Chief Accounting Officer.", "Turning to our Q4 results, we finished 2012 with both revenue and earnings at the high end of our revised targets. Fourth quarter sales increased 5.5% on a reported basis, and up 6.1% in constant currency with no meaningful impact from acquisitions. We did have one extra selling day in the quarter, which added 1.7 percentage points to total company revenue growth. For the full year, sales growth, excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, came in at 4.2%, which is at the upper end of the 2.5% to 4% target we revised in October. While the challenges in Europe and hospital capital equipment continued in Q4, this was offset by accelerated growth in many of our U.S. businesses. A key focus for our teams globally is accelerating revenue growth, as we look to leverage our diverse product portfolio, including internal innovation and the impact from our targeted acquisitions.", "Looking at our 3 segments in more detail, Q4 sales growth was led by 11% constant currency growth for Neurotechnology and Spine, including a strong 10% U.S. Spine growth. Reconstructive posted a 7.4% constant currency gain, powered by a 14% increase in U.S. sales. MedSurg growth, excluding foreign exchange, up 2.7%, reflected the continued pressure on our medical business, as well as the impact from the previously discussed Neptune waste management product recall. However, these challenges were offset by increasing momentum within Endoscopy behind our new camera launch, coupled with solid gains in instruments, excluding Neptune, and double-digit growth for sustainability solutions. On a geographic basis, the U.S. once again led growth in the quarter, increasing 8.7%.", "Outside the U.S., we remain challenged, particularly in Europe, which declined in the mid-single digits on an operating basis. We have taken specific steps to address our underperformance in Europe, including filling key leadership gaps and implementing measures to drive better execution. However, as previously mentioned, this turnaround will take multiple quarters and we don't expect to see improving momentum before the second half of 2013.", "And while off a relatively small base, we are encouraged by continued strong double-digit growth in emerging markets, which will be further bolstered by the recently announced acquisition of Trauson Medical. As Katherine will discuss shortly, we are excited about the long-term potential of this acquisition, as it expands our offering into the fast-growing value segment of the Chinese orthopedic market.", "In addition to solid Q4 sales growth, we delivered a 100-basis point year-over-year increase in adjusted gross margin, which came in at 68.3% of sales. Combined with a continued focus on managing our operating expenses, our adjusted operating margin improved by 120 basis points versus the prior year, coming in at 25.3% and helping to lift our adjusted diluted net earnings per share by 12% to $1.14. For the full year, adjusted per share earnings of $4.07, up 9%, was at the high end of the $4.04 to $4.07 range, which we reset in October.", "In closing, we are pleased with our Q4 performance and are encouraged by the momentum we see heading into 2013. Without a doubt, we have challenges that we will need to work through, including driving the turnaround in Europe. But we are also well positioned to capitalize on our diverse product offering and strong presence in a wide range of key markets within medical technology. We are highly encouraged by the impact of our acquisition activity in recent years, which has bolstered our own investments in R&D.", "For example, our Memometal acquisition in July 2011 contributed to a robust U.S. foot and ankle growth of 39% in Q4. We have further strengthened our global footprint with the pending acquisition of Trauson Medical, which we believe will be a key component to our long-term expansion in emerging markets. As we turn to 2013, we remain focused on driving sales growth through innovation, cross divisional collaboration and selected acquisitions.", "We will continue to drive operating efficiencies in order to ensure continued margin expansion. And we are committed to optimizing shareholder returns through highly selective M&A, continued growth in our dividends and share buybacks. Given the strength of our balance sheet, we are well positioned to pursue all 3 components of our capital allocation strategy, as evidenced by the ongoing deal activity, the recently announced 25% increase in our quarterly dividend and the expansion in our share authorization to $1 billion.", "We are committed to delivering on our stated financial targets for 2013, which include sales growth, excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions of 3% to 5.5%, with adjusted diluting net earnings per share of $4.25 to $4.40, up 4% to 8%, which includes the roughly $100 million pretax impact from the medical device excise tax. Excluding the tax, we are targeting an 8% to 12% increase in our per share earnings, reflecting our commitment to both solid sales growth and leveraged earnings gains.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today's call will focus on our planned acquisition of Trauson Holdings, which expands our presence in the emerging market. Specifically, last week, we announced that we will make a voluntary general offer to acquire all the shares of Trauson in an all-cash transaction for approximately $685 million. Trauson was founded in China in 1986 and with sales in 2011 approximating $60 million, the company is the leading trauma manufacturer in China and a key competitor in the Spine segment.", "As some of you may recall, Stryker and Trauson have maintained a relationship under an OEM agreement for instrumentation since 2007. With this move, we are expanding our presence in the key emerging market through a product portfolio and pipeline that has targeted the large and fast-growing value segment of the Chinese orthopedic market.", "Importantly, the acquisition of Trauson is a critical step towards broadening our presence in China and developing a product platform targeted at the value segment of emerging markets. With this acquisition, we gain access to Trauson's R&D expertise, as well as the strength of its distribution network.", "Looking at the company's product portfolio, Trauson has over 120 products marketed under its own brand, as well as an attractive pipeline. With well over 2 decades of experience in the Chinese orthopedic market, Trauson has a well-established brand that it leverages to an extensive distributer network. For Stryker, the acquisition is consistent with our strategy of expanding our global footprint and increasing our exposure in the fast-growing emerging market. As part of that effort, we have prioritized China and the value segment of the market in particular as a critical market, given that the device segment is growing at roughly 20% annually, with the overall market expected to more than double in the next 5 years.", "To date, Stryker's presence in China has been focused on the premium segment, which is dominated by multinational players. However, the value segment of the market is growing at a faster rate, with local manufacturers the key players. With increased government and private health care spending, the value segment of the Chinese orthopedic market is expected to continue to expand at above global market rates and with the acquisition of Trauson, we will be well positioned as a leading company to capture that growth. We also believe we have the ability to further leverage Trauson's product offering into other emerging markets.", "We expect the acquisition will close by the end of the second quarter of 2013 and, excluding acquisition- and integration-related charges, the deal does not impact our 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share target of $4.25 to $4.40.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Dean.", "Dean H. Bergy", "Thanks, Katherine. As Kevin indicated, strong growth in our U.S. Reconstructive and Neurotechnology and Spine product segments helped us achieve sales growth of 5.5% on a reported basis and 6.1% in constant currency. With respect to earnings, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.14, representing growth of 11.8% when compared to last year's fourth quarter.", "On a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.71, down 32.4% versus the prior year, primarily as a result of the charge in the quarter related to the rejuvenate and ABG II product recall. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP net earnings per share is provided in the tables accompanying today's press release.", "In reviewing the quarter, I will start with a discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, volume and mix contributed 7.5% to our top line growth. Price changes reduced sales by 1.4%, generally in line with the levels experienced throughout the year. In addition, currency negatively impacted our top line by approximately $13 million and decreased our overall reported sales growth by 0.6%.", "Looking at our reporting segments, I will start with Reconstructive products, which represented 45% of our sales in the quarter. Reconstructive products include our hip, knee, trauma and other reconstructive lines. Sales in the Reconstructive segment were up 6.7% as reported and grew 7.4% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 13.9% in the quarter. Trauma and extremities led the way in the U.S. with 26% growth, driven by new products, expansion of our sales force, strong growth in foot and ankle and a pickup related to a competitor's product recall.", "In addition, knees continue to benefit from our GetAroundKnee direct-to-consumer campaign, posting 9% growth and hips with a 7% increase also had a very nice quarter. U.S. gains were partially offset by weakness in our international Reconstructive business, where sales declined 0.7% in constant currency with the European sales down mid-single digits and most other developed overseas markets growing at low- to mid-single digit levels in local currency.", "Next I will turn to the MedSurg product segment, which represented approximately 37% of sales in the quarter. For reporting purposes, MedSurg is comprised of Instruments, Endoscopy, Medical and the Sustainability Solutions business. Total MedSurg sales increased 2.4% as reported and 2.7% on a constant currency basis. These results were led by growth from our Endoscopy and Sustainability Solutions businesses. Endoscopy is starting to benefit from the launch of the new 1488 Camera, as we have resolved the early technical glitches and are now in full launch mode.", "Instruments reported mid-single digit sales growth, as we continue to see solid gains for our Power Tools segment, partly offset by the Neptune Waste Management System recall, which adversely impacted sales by approximately $18 million in the quarter. We expect this recall to negatively impact sales by about $17 million to $20 million per quarter until we obtain regulatory clearance. As we work with the FDA to address the requirements for the Neptune 510(k), we anticipate this regulatory clearance is unlikely to be achieved in the first half of 2013.", "As anticipated, medical sales declined by 7.4%, as this predominantly U.S.-driven business continued to be challenged by strong comparables and some belt tightening associated with hospital capital spending.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represented 18% of company sales, had an excellent quarter. Sales increased 9.7% as reported and 10.8% on a constant currency basis. Our Neurovascular, NSE and Interventional Spine platforms all generated double-digit constant currency growth. Neurovascular saw a continued strong uptake for the Target Coil, as well as nice performance from the recently launched Trevo stent retriever.", "Core spinal implant sales accelerated to post mid-single digit constant currency sales growth, helped by a double-digit increase from the Biologics products obtained with our acquisition of Orthovita.", "I will now turn to the income statement, beginning with our gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins in the fourth quarter finished at 68.2%, while adjusted gross margins finished at 68.3%. The adjusted gross margin represents 100 basis point improvement on a year-over-year basis and it was in line with the previous 2 quarters of this year. The improvement over 2011 was driven by favorable product mix, continued cost reduction efforts from our global quality and operations group and a favorable comparative impact from currency, all of which were partially offset by the negative impact of pricing. Adjusted gross margin for the full year was 68.1% in 2012 compared to 67.9% in 2011.", "Research and development spending finished at 5.5% of sales, consistent with the prior quarter and our overall expectations. Selling, general and administrative cost represented 44.2% of sales. These costs include a $174 million pretax charge related to the voluntary recall of our rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems , which was described in detail in the January 9 press release announcing our preliminary 2012 results. The charge establishes reserves representing the low end of the range of estimated probable loss. This recall is still in a very early stage and will continue to be evaluated at a quarterly basis based on information we receive related to the status of the recall.", "Adjusting for the rejuvenate charge, as well as restructuring- and acquisition-related charges, fourth quarter SG&A finished at 36.2% of sales. This compares to adjusted SG&A at 36.6% of sales in the prior year. Adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales finished 2012 at 37.2%, in line with the prior year.", "Reported operating income for the fourth quarter declined 11.5% compared to 2011 and was 15.8% of sales. Adjusted fourth quarter operating income increased 10.7% and the adjusted operating margin finished at 25.3%, a 120-basis point pickup versus the prior year, primarily as a result of the significant improvement in gross margin.", "Other income and expense reduced pretax income by $12 million in the quarter. You'll recall that 2011's fourth quarter included a $27 million reduction in interest expense associated with recording a favorable tax settlement of the IRS' cost sharing arrangement. Adjusting for this, the prior year Q4 expense for this line would be comparable to this year.", "Components of the current year's other income and expense included investment and interest income of $10 million, offset by interest expense of $19 million and a foreign exchange transaction loss of $3 million. The company's effective income tax rate was 24.6% for the fourth quarter of 2012, compared to 7.4% in the prior year. The prior year rate was reduced by the settlement of the Irish cost sharing arrangement, as well as tax benefits associated with inventory step up and higher tax rate jurisdictions. Excluding these items in 2011, our adjusted fourth quarter tax rate finished at 25.4%. The current year rate was in line with our expectations.", "The effective tax rate for 2013 will reflect the benefit of the adoption in January by the U.S. Congress of the law to extend certain tax benefits applicable to the company. The extension applies to both 2012 and 2013. However, the timing of the adoption dictates the 2000 tax year -- 2012 tax year benefit, must be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 for financial reporting purposes. Hence, we will receive 5 quarters of tax benefit related to the extenders in our upcoming first quarter, which is expected to positively impact adjusted EPS by approximately $0.04. The total year tax benefit of the extenders is expected to be approximately $0.06 to $0.07 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, an increase of approximately $870 million compared to year-end 2011. As a reminder, we have $1.75 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet.", "On the asset management side, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 55, which was down 4 days from the third quarter and 3 days compared to December 2011. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 153, which was down an impressive 30 days sequentially and down 5 days when measured against the prior year.", "Turning to cash flow. In the quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $596 million and we reported operating cash flow of $1.657 billion for the full year, an increase of 16% versus 2011.", "Finally, in the fourth quarter, we did not repurchase any stock. For the year, we repurchased 2.1 million shares and spent $108 million to do so. During the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors increased the amount of open share repurchase authorizations to $1 billion from $595 million.", "And lastly, turning to the outlook, as we outlined in our January 9th press release for the full year 2013, we are projecting constant currency sales growth at a range of 3% to 5.5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 0% to 1% in both the first quarter and full year of 2013. As previously communicated, 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share, including the estimated $100 million pretax impact from the medical device excise tax, is projected to be in a range of $4.25 to $4.40.", "With that, we will now open up the call to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So 2 questions. One on the guidance and one on the U.S. hip and knee market. So maybe I'll start with the U.S. hip and knee market. You guys obviously had an extra selling day. You had slightly easier comps. And yet, even excluding those, you still seemed to produce a really good growth rate in U.S. hips and knees this quarter. I was wondering if I could get your just perspective on the U.S. market. How much of that do you think was share gains? Is there something real going on in the market? Just provide a little more perspective on the U.S. hip and knee results that you put up this quarter.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Bob, it's Katherine. Maybe I'll just take a stab at it. As you can understand, this is probably a little bit tough to peg because we don't have everybody else's numbers in at this point. We are certainly pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the U.S. in both hips and knees and some of that is on the knee side from the GetAroundKnee campaign. On the hip side, some good products like Accolade, which we launched in the second quarter of last year. I think at this point, at the very least, the market is stable, to maybe modestly improved in the fourth quarter. How much share shifting we've seen, it's just too early to predict until all the numbers come in. But we feel pretty good about the stability of the market and certainly some of the momentum that we're seeing.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then on guidance for 2013, I'm asking this within the context of a fourth quarter operating margin number that was one of your better quarters of operating leverage in quite some time here in fourth quarter, as you stated in your prepared remarks. And so I'd just like to get a sense from you guys as to whether or not that can be sustainable throughout 2013. And the way I'd ask the question is, you gave guidance of -- using mid-points, roughly a little over 4% revenue growth and then 8% to 12% EPS growth, excluding the med tech tax. So to get from that 4%, to the 8% to 12%, is most of that continued underlying operating margin growth? And if the answer is yes, what's allowing you to, finally, enter a sustained period of operating leverage at Stryker?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Bob, this is Dean. I mean, obviously, we've had 3 quarters of pretty good gross margin numbers. We did have a very good quarter from an operating leverage standpoint. Obviously, this is a quarter where, from a sales standpoint, it's our biggest quarter in terms of the numbers that we put up there. But I think we do feel good about our ability to drive some operating margin into it. Obviously, that was implied in what we had told you relative to guidance. So we feel good about where the business is positioned. We've done things with the Global Quality and Operations to start to give cost savings there. And we're continuing to look at other places in the business where we can reach out for that. So I think we feel generally pretty good about our ability to do that, but it's going to be a steady drumbeat in terms of how we tackle it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups on that. So if we look at the numbers that we've all seen over the last, let's call it few weeks, for the Recon market. There's a suggestion out there that December, in particular, was very strong as patients getting their procedures in before the end of the year, with the whole world becoming more seasonally shifted towards the back of the year. Is that something you'd confirm, or you have a view on?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say at this point, Mike, we didn't see any big end of the quarter push, or anything to suggest a seasonality or a push effect that was noticeably different than anything we've seen in other quarters. Q4 tends to have more seasonality, but obviously, that's going to get reflected as it's in the base in the prior year. So it just felt like a solid quarter again. Don't know what the market did, but I think we feel comfortable saying at the very least the market is stable to maybe modestly better. But it didn't feel like there was any kind of one-timers in there.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just as my follow-up, can you discuss a couple of other markets that you're in that are growing very well. You're obviously growing well above what market growth is. But I'd like to get your view of what underlying growth looks like right now in foot and ankle, where you've had an exceptional quarter, and in Neurovascular, where you've also had a very good quarter. Both those markets look like they've accelerated and, obviously, you're growing at some multiple of market growth.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Mike, it's Kevin Lobo. I'm going to start with the foot and ankle. Our sense of the market is that it's probably growing in somewhere in the 12% to 15% range, overall. Obviously, we had an exceptional quarter growing at 39%. If you recall, we created a new foot and ankle business unit in January of 2012. And after digesting the Memometal acquisition in the prior year, combining our current products with those products took us about 1 quarter or 2 to get our stride. We had a very strong third quarter and an even stronger fourth quarter. So we're clearly outpacing the market, but it is a good market. The market is growing double-digit. We obviously grew even faster than that. And still see tremendous opportunity for growth in the market where implants historically had not been used. So this is a market expansion story, as well as a share story.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. On the Neurovascular side, it's certainly seeing very solid momentum in that business. It's what helped contribute to the total Neuro technology business that saw that double-digit growth in the quarter. They -- the Neurovascular group, since the time of the acquisition, has continued to have a really nice flow of new products, most recently the Target Coil and then in August of last year, their earlier-than-anticipated launch of the Trevo device, which we obtained through the Concentric acquisition. So that market is probably still growing somewhere in the upper single-digit vicinity and part of that is procedure expansion and as new patients get identified, and we feel pretty good about the outlook for that type of sustained market growth.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So just -- impressive across a couple of business lines here, so there's lots of questions to ask. But maybe on Spine, you mentioned Biologics being a driver there. But even with Biologics as a driver, that was a pretty -- it was a pretty significant improvement in growth, organic growth, I should say. Should -- and how should we think about that going forward? And maybe, can you talk a little bit about that, the way, the dynamics that the Biologics is driving that business beyond just selling more Biologics? Then I have one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, if I'm understanding the question correct, I would say on the Spine side, I think we'd like to see some more quarters of putting up some improving numbers, but certainly the fourth quarter was an improvement, with that core hardware business up in the single-digit vicinity, mid-single digit vicinity, as we're starting to see some benefits of greater focus on that business, new leadership that was put in place a number of quarters ago. And then when we did the acquisition of Orthovita, a big part of the rationale, similar to Memometal, for doing these acquisitions in our core area is unlocking the value of those products that wasn't really achievable given the limited distribution in sales capabilities of the prior -- of the company as a stand-alone. So putting that into our Spine sales force, our distribution and marrying that with our product portfolio, we've been able to drive greater momentum in that business and really unlock the value we saw in that Biologics product portfolio.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Great. And then on Europe, that's a region that's struggled a little bit for some time now. And you talked about making some changes. You've made some changes. I guess I would ask when we can start to see the impact, the results of those changes coming through the numbers. And what's your confidence level that you've actually, at this point, identified the problems and addressed the problems fully?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Sure, Matt, I would say that certainly in the third quarter, we highlighted Europe as being a problem for us. And I think we went into detail about the shift that we made from a franchise model, from the country model to a franchise model and now we're sort of rebalancing our organization, picking the best of both systems. We have a whole new reorganization, new country leaders have all been appointed. We're starting to see already some early signs in Germany, which is one of the problem areas, Southern Europe continues to struggle. What I indicated on the last call is the same thing I'll say now, which is it will take us a number of quarters. We should start to see improvement in the second half of the year. You have to remember that in Europe, implants represent a bigger portion of their business than they do in the United States. And implant business historically have been a little stickier than our MedSurg businesses. So it does take time to recover the business that we have lost over the past couple of years. But I'm very confident as [indiscernible] as the new President who was appointed back in May and the number of -- the appointments he's made in the country, I had some time to spend with them recently. I'm very excited about those appointments and feel that we're on a good trajectory. It's just going to take us a bit of time. And so no surprise with the results that we posted in Europe and I would expect similar type of results for the first 2 quarters of 2013.", "Operator", "Matt Taylor, from Barclays, is online with a question.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask you about your restructuring. Certainly, starting to see some of that benefit flow through this year. But can you talk about it qualitatively in terms of how -- what specific projects you're executing? How difficult they are to execute and how many more programs like this you think you might be able to do going forward to be able to offset some pricing pressure?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Sure, this is Dean. A lot of what we're doing not surprisingly is in Europe. A lot of it is also related to some of the things that we've done in Global Quality and Operations. When we announced these projects, we thought that we'd have about $100 million of annual savings. We think about 1/3 of that will be incremental to 2013. When we initially announced this, we thought that the range of charges that we would take for restructuring would be somewhere in the $150 million to $175 million range. We think now it could be up to $50 million higher than that. And we would expect to get incremental savings ultimately of maybe of another 50% of that, the $25 million that we -- or of the $50 million of additional spending that we might do on the high end of that range. We do expect all of the projects to be completed in 2013. That additional incremental savings will really flow primarily into out years 2014. So hopefully, that answers your question.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That was great. And I guess I just wanted to ask a cap allocation question. You made the Trauson acquisition, I was curious if you could give us thoughts on just the timing of that. And I'm assuming there's no change to your overall cap allocation going forward, but maybe just remind us what your goals there are, in terms of the split of dividends, repurchase and M&A.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, there's really no change at all to the capital allocation strategy, as we talked about, and Kevin made in his comments on the call and it is 3-pronged. Our first priority continues to be M&A. And we're going to remain very focused on our core markets and key adjacent markets. And then we're going to do dividends and we announced in December a 25% increase in the quarterly dividend for 2013. And then lastly, buybacks, and we upped the authorization to $1 billion. And so given the strength of our balance sheet, we really have the flexibility to pursue all 3 and we'll continue to do that and given that we really believe optimizing shareholder value is going to come from acquisitions that drives top line growth, get us into fast-growing markets, expand our presence globally, while also looking to return income to shareholders.", "Operator", "David Lewis, from Morgan Stanley, is online with a question.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Kevin, just maybe a quick question for you and then maybe one for Kevin or Katherine. Kevin, when you think about trauma, obviously, a significant stand-out here in the quarter. And I appreciate there's a lot of different dynamics going on in the market. You obviously have a competitor recall. But there's also a lot of integration going on across, as many of the players. And I also noticed you mentioned increasing sales reps. I'm trying to figure out how much of this was really competitor recall. How much is you selectively adding to sales and potentially gaining share opportunistically given some of this -- your distraction in the industry and to what extent do you think those gains, if they're happening, are sticky?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Sure. So I think you could estimate about 1/3 of our growth was really driven by the recall. So 2/3 of the growth of the 26% you would say was just driven by core momentum. And we really had a very good third quarter as well. Then actually, if you go back the last 4 or 5 years, we've been really strengthening the trauma line. This year, we launched the Clavicle Plate. We launched Hoffmann. So we've been filling out our product bag and we are now able to really compete with Synthes even in Level I trauma centers, something that we weren't able to do about 5 or 6 years ago. So really great management, consistent management, that's filled out our product bag and a winning formula. When -- you're right, there's a lot of movement in the marketplace, a lot of integration with competitors and we've certainly been opportunistic. The stickiness related to the recall, time will tell on that, how sticky that will be. But we feel very good about the momentum in the trauma business. The additional reps were really primarily focused on the extremities areas, in the foot and ankle area et cetera, but really tremendous momentum. We've been, over the past few years, specializing our reps, sometimes just to carry a broader bag to be more focused on trauma. That has definitely paid dividends for us and we are very bullish on trauma going into 2013.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, very helpful. And then either Kevin or Kath, I wonder, with Trauson, if you could sort of take us through sort of that first 18 months and then sort of thereafter. And I guess what I'm specifically driving at is just, what is the game plan first 18 months in terms of do you use your breadth to drive better growth in China? And is that really the focus, is to accelerate and grow the Chinese market? And to what extent, maybe after 12 or 18 months, do you think about leveraging this asset, R&D and distribution, into other emerging markets, or potentially the value segment in some developed markets?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, I'll take the question, David. I would say that clearly, as we indicated in our prepared comments, the goal of this acquisition is to be able to leverage the product portfolio into other emerging markets. But it'd be too soon right now, having not even acquired the company to get into specific time lines. And really the goal over the next 18 months is to continue to strengthen our knowledge of the Chinese market. We participate in the premium segment but this gets us into the value segment of the market. And the goal here is to begin to execute on driving more products and leveraging the pipeline that they have available to them. So probably not going to get into a whole lot of specifics, particularly since we haven't closed the acquisition, but the overriding goal here was to continue to expand our footprint globally to get into what we view is the highest priority emerging market of China and in particular, the value segment where M&Cs [ph] don't really participate. It's really dominated by local players and given our existing relationship, we felt that this was a natural next step.", "Operator", "Dave Turkaly, from JMP, is online with a question.", "David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Was there any meaningful change in your distribution, your sales force, for Recon in the fourth quarter?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "No, no change at all to our model.", "David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on Trauson, just quickly. The value segment, can you give us an idea -- I realize it's small -- but what the margin profile of your sales there would look like, versus, say, what it looks like today, in a domestic market?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, that's probably a level of detail that we wouldn't go into. I mean, you can certainly look at -- Trauson's a publicly traded company and get a sense for their margin profile, which is very attractive. But we probably wouldn't get into that level of granularity, particularly for a business of this size that, relative to Stryker, is not at a level we would break out.", "Operator", "Matthew Dodds, from Citigroup, is online with a question.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "In knees, it looks like, Kevin, you made good progress with the DTC campaign, with GetAround. Is there any potential to expand that into hips maybe, or anything else?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Great question, Matt. The hip team is actually looking into it. I mean, clearly, you need to have a compelling concept if you're going to go on television and we have a compelling concept with knees. Something that's very differentiated and something that's resonating with consumers, as well as with our customers. I can tell you we are planning to continue the knee initiative. The hip team is studying it. We have, at this point, not yet made a decision. Because we really do need to have the concept that's very compelling before we would launch into that. But it is under consideration and we'll keep you posted.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "GetAroundHip is cool enough that [indiscernible]. I just have one quick...", "Kevin A. Lobo", "We can see why you're not in marketing, Matt.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Good point. Katherine, just quickly, on the med tech tax, is it in SG&A or is it somewhere else? I don't know if you said that earlier.", "Katherine A. Owen", "It's going to be somewhere else.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Could you say where the somewhere else is? It seems a lot of people are putting it in gross margin, is that not the case?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, it was a -- you have the flexibility based on the latest rules to either put it in SG&A or COGS. We'll be putting it in COGS.", "Operator", "Michael Matson, from Mizuho Securities USA, is online with a question.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I guess I just wanted to get your perspective on your knee competitive position, given that we do have some new products coming from several of your competitors. I know I've asked you this in the past, but just given that they've shed a little more light on some of the features and benefits of their products, I was wondering if you could give us an update on how you're planning to kind of fend off those new products.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, I think we're going to continue to execute on the strategy that we've outlined. We're really pleased with the concept behind the GetAroundKnee campaign, which is based on the fact that we have the only single radius knee on the market. Triathlon is not a new knee. But what's new is really differentiating and detailing in a much easier way to both customers and physicians the benefits of a single radius design. And I think that's why this knee campaign has resonated so strongly. So undoubtedly, any new competitor coming out, especially with existing surgeons, they're going to see some receptivity to that. But our focus remains on continuing to drive the features and benefits of that product, which are, really, it is the only single radius knee on the market right now. We wouldn't be continuing with the DTC campaign if we weren't really pleased with the metrics we're seeing. And obviously, the most important one being the revenue growth number. So I'm not trying to be naive about new products coming on the market, but feel really comfortable with the platform that we have and the attributes associated with Triathlon.", "Michael Matson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Okay and then on the Neurovascular business, obviously, some really strong growth there. And I think Trevo was mentioned as one of the drivers. But is that the primary driver of the acceleration? Because I guess this was the first full quarter where that product was available in the market.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say it was a contributing factor, but I wouldn't say it was the driving factor. We have a new coil on the market. We launched the nanocoil earlier in the year, which is the smallest coil in the market and is very helpful, particularly as a finishing coil. So it's -- they've had some good product momentum. I wouldn't necessarily say Trevo was the driver, but certainly a contributing factor to that business.", "Operator", "Derrick Sung, from Sanford Bernstein, is online with a question.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I wanted to ask a question on your medical -- your beds business and the kind of environment for CapEx spending. There have been some speculation that, maybe, CapEx spending was going to be shifting from -- within the hospitals coming from IT, or to other areas. And I guess maybe that doesn't look like it was the case this quarter, but I was wondering if you could just give us some more color on how the hospitals are thinking about CapEx spending, maybe how to think about it for the year. Any color there would be great.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Derrick, I'll take a stab at it. And I think as you see from our fourth quarter results, clearly, medical is still challenges we had expected following Q3. Some of that is a reprioritization of hospital capital spending around IT, as we've talked about previously and some of it is smaller budgets and people really trying to understand what are going to be the actual implications of the Affordable Care Act and it's, obviously, very early in the year to understand all of that. So we are not assuming a big rebound in that business. Initially, we're going to look at it cautiously and continue to flex -- or test flex what's going on with hospital capital budgets. But it's an area of the business that I think is inherently going to be periods where capital spending is stronger and then there's going to be periods like we're in right now where it is more challenged. We love being in this business, but going along with that means a lot more volatility in this segment than we see in some of our other businesses.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Just a follow up on pricing, in Recon, it looks like maybe it got 100 bps worse this quarter than last quarter. Are you seeing anything different? Is that just kind of variations in quarter-to-quarter and any color there would be great.", "Dean H. Bergy", "Derrick, actually in the U.S. it was pretty comparable quarter-to-quarter. We did see a little bit of a fall-off in the overseas markets. Keep in mind that we do have, for one more quarter this Japan price decrease and that was probably a little bit more of a driver in this quarter than it has been, although it's obviously been with us for 3 quarters now and will sunset after the first quarter. But the U.S. Recon pricing was reasonably in line with where it's been all year.", "Operator", "David Roman, from Goldman Sachs, is online with a question.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I was hoping we could start with gross margins. Obviously, you had a nice performance in the quarter, and Dean, you've provided some of the moving parts around the gross margin line. But can you maybe help give a little bit more detail on magnitudes of some of those pieces, underlying performance versus FX and then maybe put that into context of longer-term growth within the business and how you're thinking about higher-margin segments growing versus lower margin segments, and what that actually means to the trajectory of the gross profit line?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Well, gross margin, I don't want to belittle the topic, but it is a very, very difficult thing for us to fully get our arms around, particularly when you talk of -- start talking about 20- or 30-basis point movements. In terms of the pickup from the prior year last year, I think we did call out a couple of things that impacted it quite a bit. One was our mix and the other thing we had last year was a negative impact that we said was about 70 basis points from our decision to slow our manufacturing plants down. So certainly, on a comparative basis, year-over-year, you're seeing that. I think in this year, we called out the things that I think are important to us and I don't think there's any one that are significantly driving it more than others. Obviously, our implant business is our higher-margin businesses. And those were pretty strong this quarter. So certainly, you can assume that's part of it. But we're also, as we've said, we've got our Global Quality and Operations group continuing to make operational improvements. And we think that will continue to help us. And that's a piece of it, but these are all small incremental pieces. And certainly, currency is one that's in there that kind of moves around from quarter-to-quarter and is a little bit harder for us to peg.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe on the guidance, the 3% to 5.5% revenue growth for 2013, can you just provide -- maybe just go into a little bit more detail on some of the assumptions in terms of the end markets that underpin that guidance? The right way to think about it that, you're basically taking the 2012 operating environment and assuming that stability is sort of the normal and that is the basis for the guidance? Were there any assumptions on the various businesses improving or deteriorating in your outlook?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, David, I think your comments are appropriate. We have not assumed any type of acceleration or meaningful deterioration beyond the current trends we're seeing. Kevin talked about not expecting a meaningful turnaround in our performance in Europe until the second half of the year. But as it relates to the overall markets, we're not assuming any big change, no bolus of patients representing themselves. I think most people have gotten comfortable with the fact that that's probably not the market dynamic we're going to see.", "Operator", "Rick Wise, from Stifel, Nicolaus, is online with a question.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "First, a follow-up on the trauma and the nail pickup in the quarter. I think I missed it, did you comment, Kevin, about how sticky, or how you could hang on to some of this share you picked up just in the short run? Is it something -- is this a sustainable door that opened, or an opportunity going forward?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "At this point, it's too early for me to be able to tell you how sticky that will be. And I think the honest answer is it will vary. I think some customers who are very loyal to Synthes and who we've obviously bailed out in the short-term will go back. But I think it's allowed a lot of other customers to see what Stryker can offer. Because the Stryker they remember from 5 years ago in trauma is nothing like the Stryker of today. So it really does depend on the receptivity of the account and our sales force's ability to show them the breadth of our offering, which has increased dramatically over the past 5 years. So I would expect some of it to stick, but clearly not all of it. But it will take some time before that plays out.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And my second question, sort of a two-part to it, I'd be sort of curious to know how you're thinking in larger picture, Kevin, about this whole value segment part of the world. Yes, because they are priced in developed markets, you guys are targeting the value segment in China. Maybe talk about how this opens the door to offering a broader value product offering outside the United States, or even in developed world markets and how we can think about that theme playing out in years ahead for you.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Sure. So, obviously, for us, it's a very strategic move. As you know, the emerging markets only represents about 6% of total Stryker sales. And even though we're very excited about the growth that we're experiencing in China and India and Brazil, it's off a very small base and it's only in the premium segment. So I would say initially, the goal is clearly to operate these products in the emerging markets initially. Over time, clearly, we could see and imagine certain markets that would have room for premium and value products. I think that will take time before that plays out. But in the short term, we have tremendous opportunities in the emerging markets. We're going to focus our energy in the short term, the next sort of few years, on the emerging markets. But over time, this does open the door and provide us with a strong brand and a history and a heritage of products that could one day land up in developed markets around the world.", "Operator", "Joanne Wuensch, from BMO Capital, is online with a question.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "First one, big picture, Kevin, now that you've been there since October, can you give us an idea what you're seeing and how you want to make your mark on Stryker?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, it's been a pretty active 100 days, I would say. I've had a chance to tour all over the world with Stryker and met many of the 22,000 employees. It's been really exciting for me to see how strong our businesses are, the strength of our leadership. I would say that we really have 4 areas of opportunity, and globalization is clearly one of them. And you've seen with the -- not just the acquisition of Trauson, but otherwise we have a lot of room to grow. There's a lot of products that have been a great success within the United States that we have yet to really operationalize outside the United States. So globalization, innovation, is a big area of opportunity in terms of broadening our lens beyond product only innovation, looking at different business models. Collaboration, as a third area, collaborating across divisions to drive value for customers, we're seeing some of our divisions get together, especially in the Neuro space, as well as even in Ortho, to drive value for the customer. In the past, Stryker was very decentralized and you wouldn't see that degree of collaboration. So that's a cultural change that I'm extremely excited about, still early. But there's terrific opportunities there. And then the last area I would say is cost optimization. And Dean alluded to the Global Quality and Operations improvements that we expect to flow through the gross margin line. But I would also say that inventories are a significant opportunity for us, as well as in G&A. We are later than many organizations in moving towards shared services. So despite the strength of our P&L, the strength of our balance sheet, we still see significant opportunities for improvement coming from a very strong position. In my first 100 days, I see a lot of opportunity and teams that are very passionate and excited about getting after these opportunities.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then on a specific question. In Spine, your revenue growth, particularly in core products, is poking it's head up a little bit, so to speak. What's going on there? Is it new products, or new feet on the street?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, Joanne, I would just -- we're pleased with the fourth quarter results, but it's a quarter where we're starting to see improved momentum. So probably too early to say we've got it all figured out. We've put new leadership in some time ago, as I mentioned, and starting to see the benefits of a renewed focus there, leveraging the broader portfolio that we were able to augment with the Orthovita acquisition. But I think we need to put up a few more quarters of showing that type of improved momentum before we really think we've got this definitively on the way to rebounding.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, and there were a couple of new products, but nothing major in addition to, obviously, the Orthovita products. So we -- they do have a little bit of a fuller bag, but there wasn't, sort of a blockbuster product, that was the impetus. Just terrific performance in the field.", "Operator", "Glenn Novarro, from RBC Capital Markets, is online with a question.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions for Dean. First, Dean, I was wondering if you can help us out with 1Q EPS guidance. You're getting the benefit of the R&D tax credit, which I think you said was $0.04. The consensus for 1Q is $1.03. Should we be raising our estimate for the tax credit, or will that be reinvested? Now that's my first question. The second is related to share buyback. You didn't do a buyback in 4Q. I believe you did over $100 million for 2012, then you've got the $1 billion authorization. So should we assume a meaningful buyback in 2013?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Sure. On the R&D tax credit, what I would tell you is that, that legislation was passed in early January. Obviously, we put out our press release on January 9, so we were certainly aware of that. And we have our guidance outlined there in terms of kind of the way it flows by quarter. So obviously, it helps us in the first quarter, but we were aware of it. Certainly, probably some level of it will be reinvested. And we have a whole year to think about that. But there are opportunities always to do things to help invigorate our business. So I think the answer is, I'm not going to comment on the specific number, but you'll certainly see the way we've outlined -- the way our guidance progresses and we're comfortable with that. On the share buyback question, I think we've been pretty clear that, that's part of our plan, but it's kind of #3 in line. So we certainly have some powder there and we would look to deploy that, but I guess meaningful is in the eye of the beholder. And I think you can expect to use some of that, but it's certainly not something that we're saying you should think about as a meaningful -- a big piece of the driver of our EPS growth in 2013.", "Operator", "Larry Biegelsen, from Wells Fargo, is online with a question.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "One question on 2014 and then one question on the 2013 guidance. First, for Kevin, on 2014, an incremental 12 million people or so will gain insurance in the U.S. In your view, do you think this could have a meaningful impact on the market? Or is it going to be kind of negligible? And then just had one question on the 2013 guidance. But go ahead, Kevin, please.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Sure, so as I think about this impact in 2014, I would say it's either neutral or maybe a modest positive. I certainly think for our implant business, the vast majority of these patients are being treated today. There's not going to be an influx of new patients, I don't think, in that side of the business. There could be a pickup in some of the MedSurg businesses, potentially, as you have more patients coming through, possibly in beds, et cetera, where, if you look at patient satisfaction being a key metric for Medicare reimbursement, I think some of the hospitals that are looking to prolong may want to really invest because a bed is really seen as a very, very key element of a patient satisfaction metric. So I think we could say neutral to modest positive, but certainly in our business, there isn't -- we're not very excited by what this offers to us, based on our patient demographic and the types of products that we sell.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And on the 2013 guidance, what are you assuming for the medical business? Is it in terms of just does it get to flat for the year? And second, on the Neptune relaunch, are you assuming that it is -- in the guidance, that it's relaunched in the second half of the year? Katherine, it wasn't clear, kind of what you're assuming for the guidance.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, we're probably not going to give -- well, not probably. We're not going to give growth expectations for 2013 by segment. It's just a level of granularity that's a bit too specific. You could -- probably safe to assume, though, that we're not expecting right now a dramatic turnaround in our medical business, part of that just the inherent uncertainties that I talked about before tied to IT prioritization and also the implications of the Affordable Care Act, which we're yet to see play out. So I think you should probably be fairly cautious as you think about modeling the medical business going forward. In terms of the revenue impact from the Neptune recall, the Q4 impact was about $18 million, and we expect it to be somewhere in the $17 million to $20 million per quarter until the product's back on the market. So that will be 2 more quarters before we anniversary at Q1 and Q2. We're not assuming anything before the second half of this year in terms of being able to relaunch and even that, I would be -- I would say that, that's an approximation just given the inherent vagaries of trying to time product relaunches with FDA.", "Operator", "Rich Newitter, from Leerink Swann, is online with a question.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I was just wondering if -- within the context of your comments on capital equipment spending and the environment there, Endoscopy picked up a little bit. You have a new product cycle starting there, can you, one, just talk about, kind of, it sounds like we're kind of in quarter 1 now, with the delayed launch. How long do you think the tail should be for that product cycle? And how should we think about Endoscopy and the HD camera within the spectrum of spending and budgets and what you see for '13?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. Clearly, what we've learned is not all capital is the same. And there are much bigger ticket items and those that can be deferred and within all of our businesses, medical is the most deferrable just given the nature of the type of products, beds and stretchers, et cetera, that they sell. Our other business, Endoscopy and Instruments, to lesser degrees, have capital components. But it's a different type of capital product. Endo is, as you mentioned, launching their new camera. It officially launched very late in the second quarter. As we talked about previously, there were initially some technical glitches that is very common as we've been in this market for a number of years when you really get it out in big numbers, a brand-new launch. So that is not uncommon for us. Those have been addressed. So we are in full launch mode. And you typically, historically, have seen 3-year type product cycles when we launch a new camera. We think there's a lot of great features and benefits associated with this camera, including the visualization, as well as its ability to be used in multiple procedures within a hospital. So we're very excited about it. You saw some of the benefit tied to that in the quarter. But I do think you need to differentiate between capital related to medical, as opposed to our other capital businesses.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "And then just a quick one on Spine, would you say that the incremental improvement in performance in Spine is all Orthovita? And if so, to what extent is that the hardware pulling through Orthovita and/or are you leading with Orthovita and that's actually pulling through your core Spine instrumentation?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, I mean, we broke out on the call the growth contribution so that core Spine implant business was seeing growth in the mid-single digits and that we were seeing double-digit growth from Orthovita. Obviously, off of different bases. I would say Orthovita is benefiting from our much broader sales and distribution and that was a key part of the rationale. So we are definitely seeing some improvement. Kevin mentioned some of the product launches, although no blockbusters. But again, we're early in the turnaround. Really thrilled with what that leadership team and the sales force is doing. But I'd like to see a few quarters of sustained improvement.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "And like we saw with trauma, I think a more full bag has a wonderful impact on the field. And whether it's one help -- which one helps which one, kind of hard to go back and actually say which one is helping pull through the other products. But the more full a bag is, the more vital it is, the more the field, obviously, respond. The reaction of the customers improved and we certainly have strengthened our Spine bag, primarily with Orthovita, but also a couple of other smaller launches. And that's having an impact. So we need to see that sustained, like as Kevin said, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves after one quarter but certainly we're pleased with the fourth quarter results in Spine.", "Operator", "Rajeev Jashnani, from UBS, is online with a question.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And Katherine, I certainly appreciate your comments on the U.S. Recon market, stable, modest improvement. But I was just going to push a little bit more and if you could provide any more color I would certainly appreciate it. And perhaps there were any new accounts that you've penetrated in the quarter, or any perspective you're hearing back from existing customers in terms of procedures per day improvement? Or any other metric that you might track, would certainly be helpful.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, I would probably going to largely echo some of the prior comments. I think we're seeing good momentum tied to the GetAroundKnee campaign. Some new product launches on the hip side. My comments about the market are somewhat guesstimates because we need everybody's numbers to come in to determine whether or not we gained share or we kept pace with the market certainly as it relates to the U.S. business. So I don't think I can get much more specific. Yes, we do track other metrics, but that's probably a level of granularity in terms of new accounts that we wouldn't get into on this call but overall we feel good about the market right now and certainly about what we're seeing in our business.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "And if you look at our Recon business over the full year, it was a very strong year. So obviously, this call is focused on the fourth quarter. But if you go all the way back to January, we've had pretty much a strong year across knees and hips throughout the year. Knees, more accelerating. hips, obviously, had a little bit of a dip in the third quarter and then picked it right back up. Hips has been on a pretty good roll for almost 8 quarters now. So it's kind of sustained strong performance. I'm very happy with the leadership team we have out there. And so really have a good outlook going into next year.", "Rajeev Jashnani - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And this maybe kind of a, maybe a dumb follow-up question, but is there any reason to think that the DTC campaign would be a driver of share, or would that just be principally increasing volume at existing customers?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, it's very difficult for us to be precise on a metric like that, but I can assure that we have won new business with the knee. There are many anecdotes that I have, I can't put a specific number on it. But certainly, the attention that it's created, both with customers, as well as with consumers who have come in and asked for it, has driven some competitive volume without a doubt. So again, the exact amount, I can't be precise with you. But the fact that we're continuing with the program, obviously means there's a cost associated with a program like that. We're pleased and we're getting a return on that investment. That would not be the case if we were only selling to our existing customers.", "Operator", "Bruce Nudell, from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse, is online with a question.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Kevin, could you just comment on, broadly speaking, on developed x U.S. versus emerging x U.S. markets in terms of major joint volume growth? And the trend lines you see going forward for those?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, Bruce, maybe I'll jump in here. Clearly, in the developed -- the emerging markets, the growth is much greater than the developed markets o U.S. If you look at places like China, what we're seeing is very low penetration rates, low-single digits, whether it's trauma, hips, knee, Implants, but they're also in a very different place in terms of health care spending per capita. I don't think we see -- or once you get into developed markets, you're going to see much greater penetration rates, obviously, just given where they are in the market development. I think o U.S. and some of the Southern European countries, there's different pressures on those businesses, where, given the single-payer environment, you literally have hospitals that were doing hundreds of hip and knees a year ago and are doing a fraction of those right now, but that's a function of budgetary constraints as opposed to underlying patient demand.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, I think outside of Southern Europe, pretty steady market volume. No big increase, no big decrease. Southern Europe clearly is more depressed. When we give our commentary on Europe, right now, we're much more focused on improving our performance, understanding that it is a challenging marketplace. But we -- our goal is really to get back to market growth in Europe. But outside of Europe, we have very good market shares in the developed markets and we're seeing pretty consistent volumes, frankly, over the past few years.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And I guess my follow-up is on knees. The GetAround campaigns focused on your design philosophy. Zimmer and J&J have announced more natural-feeling knees. Are any of these claims going to be backed up by objective measures of performance and/or patient satisfaction so that it's more substantive? And maybe more sustainable?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, in our case, obviously, we've had our knee on the market for a number of years. Our revision rates are well documented, well published. So we know we have a very strong performing product. And so competitive products will have their advantages that they will tout. We know what our knee does. We know how it feels. We have enough of experience to really comment very clearly on what we're offering. And of course, we'll pay attention to the competitive offering and they'll have to demonstrate their points of difference just the same way we would. So we are aware of their features and what's different about their knees. And it's not something at this point that is overly concerning. Of course, never want to underestimate the competition, but we feel like we're in a very good place with our existing product and the innovation that we are designing around it.", "Operator", "Kristen Stewart, from Deutsche Bank, is online with a question.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I have, actually, 2. The first, just going back to the med tech tax. I think you'd said it's about $100 million in 2013. I recall initially that was a higher amount. Is the difference just simply due to the classification and cost of goods sold and will that run through, I guess, according to how inventory goes through? So maybe that effect happening more beginning in call it, maybe the second half versus the first half of the year? And in light of that, kind of where can we look for gross margins and operating margins in 2013? And I have a follow-up.", "Dean H. Bergy", "Okay. Kristen, this is Dean. The number did come down, but that was from very early on. I mean, we haven't changed the number since October. And in terms of the way it'll work for us, and I think this will be different for different companies. So you'll have to ask them. It really depends on -- it's driven by when the first sale of the product occurs. And the way it works for us, it's going to tie right to our sales. So it's going to go through the P&L right away and it will go all through gross margins we've talked about. So if you want to get an estimate of what it's going to be, you can take $100 million against our top line. That's close to 100 basis points on our gross margin.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Some of the competition have different structures, right?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Correct. So for some companies it will get stuck in inventory and roll through in a different way, but ours will go through as the sales are occurring.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just in light of that pressure, which will probably be, I guess, maybe about 100 basis points on the gross profit line, as well as operating margin, do you think that you can still show some growth and operating margin improvement? And then the second question is just, I appreciate you don't want to give specific product line guidance, but I was wondering if you guys would be willing to kind of offer your view on what your overall top line assumption for growth is broken down by the major divisions of Recon, MedSurg and then the Neurotech and Spine.", "Dean H. Bergy", "On operating margin, certainly, I -- we've kind of alluded to it. But you can see from the way our top line guidance falls relative to the way our bottom line guidance falls. You can see that there is implied operating margin improvement in there. And we expect there to be some. So we are going to be able to offset the device tax by getting additional leverage there. And relative to your other question, we really don't want to get into that level of granularity. I know we talked more about that last year, but we're comfortable we're going to be able to deliver 3% to 5%, and we believe that all 3 of our segments will contribute meaningfully to helping us get there, 5.5%, sorry.", "Operator", "Matthew O'Brien, from William Blair, is online with a question.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "A couple of them real quickly here for you. With respect to the recalls, and I think it's kind of played out at this point, but just can you give us a sense for the level of commentary you're getting back from your sales force, either with Neptune or with the 2 hip products, as far as customer dissatisfaction and any kind of impact you anticipate here in Q1?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, I would just say on the hip side, I would note that we have got about 28,000 of those implanted since launch, so a relatively small product. Obviously, any physician dealing with this, it's never a positive thing. But I would go back to what we're putting up in terms of a revenue number for our hip business and I think just given our relative size, not to diminish what some patients may be dealing with, or physicians, but given our relative size, we believe this is a manageable item. Clearly, Neptune, our sales force would rather have it on the market than off the market and we'll be working through the issues associated with that to be able to return it as quickly as possible. In the interim, we're fortunate that Instruments has a broad product offering and seeing very good momentum with the launch of their latest generation power tool that's now going into year 2 and is helping to offset some of that impact from Neptune.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay, and then just one more for me. And Katherine, and I'd be interested to hear Kevin's thoughts as well, if possible, but I know you don't want to talk about product pipeline too much, but historically, you've talked a little bit about robotic surgery for orthopedic applications as an area of interest that you've been monitoring. Have your views on that space changed in -- over the last several months? Are you more or less compelled by it today than you were maybe 6 to 12 months ago?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say that our external comments have not changed, as it relates to robotics. We think there is a role for robotics in medical technology that's been proven by what intuitive surgical has done. We think the role for it in orthopedic surgery is still evolving and has not yet been optimized. But we haven't commented about whether that means we do or don't have an internal program. I think, like anybody, we watch this space and we make those evaluations, whether it's robotics or other areas that long-term could impact the orthopedic market.", "Operator", "Josh Jennings, from Cowen and Company, is online with a question.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I guess, first, just on the gross margin line, thinking about some offsets to the med device tax, can you just comment on where you are in the formal completion of the integration of Boston Scientific manufacturing and whether, upon that completion, there would be any positive impact to the gross margin line for the Neurovascular business?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, we still have some integration work to do relative to that. That will happen later this year. I think in the second quarter, that will be pretty much complete in terms of the full changeover of the plants there. So we'll see. But that has gone reasonably smoothly, and we would expect, as we complete that, that will be the case.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And any meaningful impact to the gross margin in terms of a benefit there to offset med device tax, or has most of that been realized with the...", "Dean H. Bergy", "I think it's...", "Katherine A. Owen", "One of the factors.", "Dean H. Bergy", "It's a factor, but it's not -- I wouldn't say it's overly significant.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. Just one more, sticking on Neurovascular. Maybe your Surpass acquisition, any follow-up in terms of beginning of enrollment of the ID trial in Q4? And then just any commentary on commercialization in Europe?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, taking the latter part first, the revenue outside the U.S. is very, very minimal at this point and I would not view that as a big driver. We did start enrollment in the trial in the fourth quarter and we continue to anticipate it's going to be a few years before we have that product on the market. We are excited about it because we think a diverter's important product long-term, but it's obviously, this was still fairly early stage as we work towards getting ultimate approval.", "Operator", "I have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference over to Mr. Lobo for closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. I look forward to continuing to meet with you in the months ahead. Our conference call for the first quarter 2013 results will be held on April 24, 2013. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's first quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me is Dean Bergy, our Interim CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Also on the call today is Bill Jellison, who joined Stryker this week as our Chief Financial Officer. Dean will help support Bill during a transition period through Q2 and will continue in his capacity as our Corporate Secretary. I'd like to both welcome Bill to our team and also thank Dean for his support during this period. My executive leadership team is now fully staffed.

We will then open the call to your questions.", "Looking at our Q1 results, we achieved revenue and earnings growth in line with the targets we set out at the start of the year. On a reported basis, our first quarter sales increased 1.3%, and excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, posted a gain of 2.5%. However, adjusting for less selling days in the quarter, which reduced sales by approximately 2.5%, top line growth was 5%, with all 3 of our franchises, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotech and Spine, achieving year-over-year gains. The U.S. had another strong showing with sales up 4% on a reported basis.", "As anticipated, our international results were negatively impacted by year-over-year declines in Europe, which was partly offset by solid gains in emerging markets. We continue to anticipate improving trends in our European business as 2013 unfolds, reflecting the impact of a number of initiatives underway to better drive sales momentum.", "Turning to our 3 franchises in more detail. On a global basis, Reconstructive sales were up roughly 1% on a reported basis, reflecting another strong showing in the U.S., which was up 6.5% reported. And encouragingly, adjusting for the selling days and currency, growth for our international Reconstructive business was positive for all of the key businesses, including hips, knees and trauma and extremities. In the U.S., while knee momentum slowed modestly, hips were strong and trauma and extremities grew at 26%. Within extremities, foot and ankle continued to roll, growing at 50%. And our joint preservation business, which includes sports medicine, implants and biologics, grew over 50% behind its new all-suture anchor.", "Worldwide MedSurg sales increased less than 1% on a reported basis, but when adjusted for currency and selling days, posted gains in both the U.S. and international despite continued challenges related to the previously disclosed Neptune recall.", "Lastly, our Neurotech and Spine franchise continued to demonstrate strong momentum, with global sales up 4% reported and 8% excluding currency and the impact of selling days. With a relatively balanced growth geographically and powered by double-digit gains in neurovascular, craniomaxillofacial and neuro Powered Instruments.", "Moving down the P&L, a few highlights to note. Gross margin, excluding acquisition and restructuring charges, declined 30 basis points year-over-year to 67.5%. However, this included a 100-basis-point impact from the medical device excise tax, which totaled $23 million in Q1 and is captured in our cost of goods sold. Importantly, we continue to make significant investments in innovation, as evidenced by the 15% increase in R&D spending versus the prior year. All told, these results, combined with the previously disclosed benefit from the tax extenders, resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.03, up 4% year-over-year.", "Looking ahead to the remainder of 2013, we remain focused on delivering on our financial targets, which includes top line growth of 3% to 5.5%, excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, and adjusted EPS of $4.25 to $4.40. As in any year, we are navigating challenges, such as the timing of getting Neptune back on the market, and more recently, the impact of the rapidly weakened yen. With respect to the latter, compared to the start of the year when we set out guidance, based on current exchange rates, the total impact from foreign exchange is expected to adversely affect our per-share earnings for 2013 by roughly $0.15. If exchange rates remain at current levels, we would anticipate our full year EPS at the lower end of our targeted range.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today's call will focus on providing our view as it relates to the reconstructive and capital markets. With respect to the reconstructive market, we continue to believe we are seeing an overall stabilization in the U.S. hip and knee market, and anticipate normalized revenue growth for the market to approximate the low- to mid-single-digit range. As has occurred in prior years, we believe Q4 Recon growth benefited modestly as more patients opted to use up flexible spending accounts prior to year-end expiration of those benefits. Consequently, elective procedures are somewhat stronger in Q4 versus Q1, and we suspect this trend continued in 2013, particularly as it relates to knees, which tend to be a more deferrable procedure versus hips.", "We continue to anticipate stable U.S. recon market growth for the remainder of 2013, and believe we are well positioned given our product portfolio. We continue to anticipate filing a 510(k) for our ShapeMatch custom cutting guides in the second quarter. While there's been some impact on the knee sales post the recall of the guides in mid-Q4, we do not believe it's been significant. We also continue to invest in our GetAroundKnee campaign, which has proven to be effective in communicating to patients and doctors the unique aspects of our Triathlon knee, which remains the only single-radius knee on the market. And with 5 years of peer-reviewed clinical data demonstrating the knee design's efficacy, we believe the Triathlon knee platform is well positioned in the market.", "Turning to hospital capital expenditures. The trend improved in Q1, although we are cognizant that these businesses are inherently more volatile. And therefore, we continue to anticipate greater quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in our more capital-intensive franchises. Nonetheless, we're encouraged by the solid performance for medical, which is the highest component of capital sales.", "Looking at our endoscopy business, we achieved double-digit camera growth in the quarter, reflecting the impact from the continued ramp-up of our next-generation 1488 Camera. However, this was partially offset by softness in communications sales, as this business is 100% capital and, as such, the timing of orders can vary quarter-to-quarter.", "Finally, as we've discussed previously, we do not anticipate at this time a meaningful impact on either elective procedures or our capital businesses from the ACA, although we will continue to monitor closely going forward.", "And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dean.", "Dean H. Bergy", "Thanks, Katherine. Sales in the quarter were in line with our expectations, which reflected a lower number of selling days compared to the prior year. Sales grew 1.3% on a reported basis and 2.6% in constant currency, with U.S. sales growth leading the way. With respect to earnings, we delivered adjusted diluted net earnings per share of $1.03, representing growth of 4% when compared to the first quarter of 2012.", "On a GAAP diluted -- on a GAAP basis, diluted net earnings per share were $0.79, down 13.2% versus the prior year, as a result of charges in the quarter to increase reserves related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II product recalls and certain regulatory matters, as well as the cost of continued acquisition and restructuring-related activities. A reconciliation of non-GAAP to GAAP net earnings per share is provided in the tables accompanying today's press release.", "In reviewing the quarter, I will start with a discussion of the components of our revenue growth. In the first quarter, volume and mix contributed 3.8% to our top line growth and acquisitions added 0.2%. Price changes reduced sales by 1.3%. The price decline is in line with the decreases experienced in 2012.", "Currency, driven primarily by a significant weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted our top line by approximately $28 million and decreased our overall reported sales growth by 1.3%. We also had 1 or 2 fewer comparative selling days in the first quarter, depending on geography. This reduced sales by approximately 2.5% in the quarter.", "Looking at our reporting segments. I will start with the Reconstructive products, which represented 44% of our sales in the quarter. Reconstructive products include our hip, knee, trauma and other reconstructive lines. Sales in the Reconstructive segment were up 1.2% as reported and 2.8% on a constant currency basis. U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 6.5% in the quarter.", "Trauma and extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S., posting 26% growth, led by new products, strong sales force execution and nice growth in foot and ankle.", "Domestic hips grew at solid, mid-single-digit levels in the quarter, while knee growth softened as we saw some impact from the absence of our ShapeMatch cutting guides from the market.", "Our international Reconstructive business was down 1.9% in constant currency, but was also impacted by the lesser number of selling days. The strongest performance overseas was in the emerging markets.", "Next, I will turn to the MedSurg product segment, which represented approximately 38% of sales in the quarter. For reporting purposes, MedSurg is comprised of instruments, endoscopy, medical and the sustainability solutions business.", "Total MedSurg sales increased 0.3% as reported and 1% on a constant currency basis. These results were led by growth from our medical and sustainability solutions businesses. Both medical and sustainability grew by mid-single digits in the U.S, with medical benefiting from a soft comparable.", "Instruments and endoscopy both posted mid-single-digit growth in constant currency internationally. Instrument sales in the U.S. were hindered by the impact of the Neptune Waste Management System recall, which reduced sales by approximately $20 million in the quarter.", "As a reminder, we believe this recall will negatively impact sales by about $17 million to $20 million per quarter until we obtain regulatory clearance. As we work with FDA to address the requirements for the Neptune 510(k), we don't think this regulatory clearance is likely to be achieved until late this year.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represented 18% of company sales, had a very good quarter. Sales increased 4% as reported and 5.7% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this segment was led by our neuro Powered Instruments platform, NSE, which posted a growth about 20%; and our neurovascular and craniomaxillofacial franchises, both of which generated high-single-digit constant currency growth. Core spinal implant sales were flat in the U.S. and down slightly overseas.", "I will now turn to the income statement, beginning with our gross margin performance. On a reported basis, gross margins in the first quarter finished at 67.4%, while our gross -- adjusted gross margins finished at 67.5%. These amounts include the impact of the medical device excise tax in 2013, which reduced gross margin by 100 basis points. The prior year adjusted gross margin for the first quarter was 67.8%. The current year gross margin was favorably impacted by lower inventory charges, favorable mix and the continued benefit from cost-reduction efforts being driven by our global quality and operations group.", "Research and development spending finished at 5.9% of sales compared to 5.2% in the prior year first quarter, and up from 5.5% sequentially. The 15% increase in R&D spending over last year was primarily the result of increased investment in additional R&D projects and innovation activities.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 41.8% of sales. These costs include a $40 million pre-tax charge to increase the reserve related to the voluntary recall of our Rejuvenate and ABG II modular-neck hip stems, a $40 million pre-tax charge to increase reserves associated with the U.S. Department of Justice subpoena related to the OtisKnee device, and an SEC inquiry regarding possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Rejuvenate recall is still at an early stage and will continue to be evaluated on a quarterly basis based on information we receive related to the status of the recall.", "Adjusting for these charges, as well as restructuring and acquisition-related charges, SG&A spending in the quarter finished at 37.2% of sales. This compares to adjusted SG&A at 37.5% of sales in the prior year, which included approximately $8 million of CEO severance costs.", "Reported operating income for the first quarter declined 18.9% compared to 2012 and was 17.6% of sales. Adjusted first quarter operating income decreased 2.1% versus the prior year, and the adjusted operating margin finished at 22.9%, an 80-basis-point decline from the prior year, primarily as a result of the added costs of the medical device tax and the increase in R&D spending, partially offset by the other factors that we previously described as providing additional gross margin.", "Other income and expense reduced pre-tax income by $11 million in the quarter compared to an $8 million reduction in 2012. Components of the current year's other income and expense included investment in interest income of $5 million, offset by interest expense of $16 million. The company's effective income tax rate was 18.9% for the first quarter of 2013 compared to 25.2% in the prior year. The effective rate on earnings before adjustments approximated 20%.", "The current year effective tax rate reflects the benefit of the adoption in January by the U.S. Congress of a law to extend certain tax benefits applicable to the company for both 2012 and 2013. The timing of the adoption required the entire amount of the 2012 tax year benefit to be recognized in the first quarter of 2013 for financial reporting purposes. And as a result, this year's first quarter includes 5 quarters of tax benefit related to the extenders, and had a positive impact on net earnings per share of approximately $0.04. The total year tax benefit of the extenders is expected to be approximately $0.07 per share.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with $4.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, an increase of approximately $200 million compared to year-end 2012. This includes additional borrowing of $1 billion added under the public debt offering we concluded in March, with $600 million of 5-year borrowing and $400 million of 30-year debt. We also used cash in the quarter for the acquisition of Trauson Holdings Limited, which was successfully closed late in the first quarter. We now have $2.77 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet.", "From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 58, which was up 3 days from year end but down 3 days versus the prior year quarter. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 167, which was up 14 days sequentially and down 2 days when measured against the prior year quarter, and the growth [indiscernible] partially reflects inventory added in the Trauson acquisition.", "Turning to cash flow. We had an excellent quarter, generating cash from operations of $236 million compared to $35 million in the prior year. With this start, we expect 2013 to be another strong year for operating cash flow.", "Finally, regarding share repurchases, we announced a $250 million accelerated share repurchase program on March 1 of this year. Under this program, we immediately reduced the company's outstanding share count by 3.6 million shares, the minimum number of shares that would be repurchased. The ASR program was completed in April, and the final number of shares repurchased totals 3.8 million, which will be fully effective in the second quarter. Implementation of the program reduced the amount of open share repurchase authorizations to $750 million from $1 billion.", "Turning to our outlook for the rest of the year, we are projecting constant currency sales growth, excluding acquisitions, in the range of 3% to 5.5% for the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% to 2% in both the second quarter and for the full year of 2013.", "As Kevin indicated previously, while we have not changed our projection that 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share will be in a range of $4.25 to $4.40, we felt it was important to provide greater clarity regarding the potential impact of currency on the year, which, based on current FX rates, we estimate to be approximately 15% -- or $0.15 per share.", "With that, we'll now open the call up to your questions. And joining us for the Q&A period will be our Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer, Tony McKinney.", "[qa/>", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matthew O'Brien with William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I thought we can just start on the -- within the large joint market. Generally speaking, just what are you seeing on the volume side of things? It seems like the quarter was solid, but somewhat uninspiring with respect to volumes. Are you seeing anything different than we've seen in the past several quarters?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, it's Katherine. I would just go back to some of the formal comments on the call. The quarter, nothing significantly out of expectations, getting back to that normalized what we think is going to be low- to mid-single-digit market growth. As we mentioned, we think there was some modest seasonality as we've seen in prior years, probably a little bit more so as it's been accelerating each year, which made the fourth quarter a little bit stronger. And that's very consistent with what we've commented previously. That's probably a little bit more so in the case of knees. It is a more deferrable procedural versus hips, and that's partially why we think we saw a little bit stronger hip growth versus knee growth. I would call that just kind of a normal Q4 to Q1 pattern versus any real deviation from what we believe to be normalized growth.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then, with respect to AAOS, and I know it's still fairly early, but there was a lot of noise made by a couple of your competitors on the knee side. What have you heard so far back from the field as far as what they are thinking within their customer base, in terms of some potential trialing of these new knee products versus just sticking with Triathlon?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think it was just similar to AAOS. [indiscernible] to be that different. We are still early on. As you know, when companies roll out new hip and knee systems, there's a period of time of trialing, getting their own sales force comfortable with it, and then typically focusing on their existing customer base. So I'm sure there'll be some impact out there. We feel really well positioned with Triathlon as the only single-radius knee on the market. That said, we're obviously going to be cognizant of what the competitors are doing. But it's probably Q3 to Q4 before we would really start to see any impact to the degree it occurs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Dodds. He is with the firm of Citigroup.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A couple of quick questions. The R&D, I know you said it was up 15% on new plans. It seemed higher than I thought for the start of the year. Can you say if this run rate -- is this more of the new run rate for the year? And is there any particular area where the spend is higher, whether it's, say, neuro?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I wouldn't say there's any significant change. We've talked about R&D running between 5% to 6% of sales. That continues to be our expectation. It may be higher or lower in any given quarter. And the year-over-year growth rate, obviously, can fluctuate the timing of investments and trials and the like. But there's variability among all the different businesses. But that said, all of them are seeing increases in R&D spending. So for modeling, I would continue to assume it's going to be somewhere to 5%, 6% of sales.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, Matt, this is Kevin. What I'd just add is, I had a chance to visit a number of the divisions and I could tell you, we have exciting pipelines across multiple divisions. I was at neurovascular, endoscopy and, just recently, at instruments, and we have really, really exciting pipelines across the portfolio. It's fair to say that as neuro becomes a bigger part of Stryker, that clearly carries a little bit more R&D. But it -- as Katherine said, between 5% to 6% is what you should be looking for.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then one quick follow-up for ShapeMatch. How big is the market do you think today, in the U.S., is custom cutting guides? It thought it was still pretty small, so the impact wouldn't be that bad while you're off the market. Is that fair?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. Yes, I think that's a fair comment, Matt. We've been off the market since the mid of Q4 and obviously, we had pretty solid fourth quarter in knees. Clearly, we're not selling ShapeMatch. So there's some revenue impact. But it really is immaterial, certainly, to total Stryker, but also to our knee business. We estimate, it's hard to get really good data, but it's probably about 10% of knee procedures use some type of custom cutting guide.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry, I'm obsessed with the improving EU trends, Kevin. Can you give us a little more color on where you are now and you're continuing -- what's making you continue to feel encouraged there?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So the first thing I would say is, the message I've delivered since the fourth quarter last year is still the same. It's going to take multiple quarters before we start to see significant improvement. We'll start to see that improvement in the second half of this year. I believe, and I'm feeling more confident, because I'm doing monthly reviews with our European business. They put all the new leaders in place at the country level. We've just had our former Vice President of knees just take a new assignment in Europe, leading the orthopedic franchise within Europe. So the leadership team is very solid. I've looked at detailed action plans country by country, feeling very, very good about the plans in place. Certainly, we're seeing good results in the U.K. and France and some of the Northern Europe countries. Certainly, Southern Europe is still very challenging and will take time. But I can see the momentum in terms of how the physicians are re-engaged with us, how our employees are re-engaged. So this is something that we've seen happen in other parts of the world. It takes a little bit of time, but we're on a very good trajectory. And I would anticipate improvement in the second half of the year.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And just as a follow-up, in terms of getting Neptune back on the market, can you give us any more sense of what has to be done to -- the process of making it happen or, again, any more color there and detail?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, Rick. And really, we need to file the 510(k). So that process is under way, and that's the key milestone over the next few months is to file that. And as Dean commented, based on our expectation, is it's going to be late this year when we anticipate getting 510(k) clearance. We anniversary the impact after the second quarter, since the recall occurred early in the third quarter. And exact timing beyond that is just too difficult to predict, but the key is obviously getting the 510(k) filed.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So one follow-up Katherine, for you, on the comments you made on the recon market. I think the selling day impact is pretty well understood, but the seasonality you mentioned was deeper here in the first quarter, at least it looked that way from your business. I appreciate the color for the sort of full year growth rate, but as we're a couple of quarters away from the third quarter, last year was a pretty big seasonal dip, should we be thinking about just sort of like a little bit more of an up, stronger Q2; down, stronger Q3; up, stronger Q4 kind of volatility, given what you've seen in the last few quarters? And I have one follow up.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. I don't think we could be that specific, Matt. We obviously saw difference in selling days. We had an extra selling day in the fourth quarter, roughly 1 to 2 fewer selling days this quarter. Trying to tease out exactly how many basis points seasonality was, it's difficult. But what I can tell you is, as we've seen in the last 2 years, with deductibles increasing, with unemployment, et cetera, it does seem there's been a modestly, and I would really stress modestly stronger seasonality impact in the fourth quarter and a corresponding modestly slower one in the first quarter. Overall, everything that we see points to a recon market that is stabilizing around that low- to mid-single-digit growth for the market.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the capital side, understanding also the impact of Neptune, I guess we saw a little bit of a reversal here in the first quarter, where I think most folks were expecting bents [ph] to be down a little more and they were actually up. And most folks were expecting endoscopy and instruments to be up maybe a little more, and they were actually kind of flat or down. Can you talk at all about any of the dynamics in the quarter that you're seeing there, maybe your expectations for those trends going forward?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. I think with medical, it's -- well over 90% of that businesses is capital. So it is inherently probably the most volatile. And just given the timing of orders, regardless of the market, it can vary quarter to quarter. So it's not surprising that we could be better or worse than expectations. And I think that's just the reality of that business. With respect to endoscopy, as I mentioned, double-digit camera growth. That's obviously being powered, and that's a U.S. number, by the launch of the 1488 Camera. And we're pleased as that continues to ramp. But the communications business, which is dominated by our Endosuite, is 100% capital. And that businesses is also volatile, so it can be stronger or weaker in any given quarter. There's nothing there that alarms us. It's just the nature of having a business that's got a significant capital component. In terms of the outlook for the full year, we haven't given granularity around the 3 key segments. But with the growth that we saw this quarter, particularly on an adjusted basis, we feel very good about being able to deliver that underlying growth of 3% to 5.5% for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities.", "David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Just quickly, I was wondering, on the ShapeMatch, if you could give us some of the same color you did for Neptune. Exactly what -- to that recall -- did you say you already submitted the 510(k) for that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. I said we anticipate filing the 510(k) in the coming months, hopefully, some time around the second quarter. And we're looking to potentially receive 510(k) clearance late this year.", "David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just quickly, we saw a recent NICE guideline, and I know spine is a little flat for you in the quarter and maybe it decelerated a bit. But would you be willing to give us any color on Cortoss from Orthovita, how that's been? Is that a growth driver for you? Is it really just the Vitoss side?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So Cortoss is obviously the smallest of the products that we acquired with the Orthovita acquisition, and it's being sold today by our IVS business. It had a kind of a slow year last year but had a -- actually, a very strong first quarter. And we report our IVS business as part of our Neurotechnology and Spine. It was up very, very strong double-digit growth, and I think that's the product that is just gaining steam within the sales force. It's clearly not on the scale of Vitoss, but it's something that we feel very good about. It's an excellent product, and we had terrific results in the first quarter. But it's very, very small in the big scheme of things.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So first question, I just wanted to come back to the EPS guidance for 2013 that you talked about. And I was wondering if, Dean or Katherine, you could walk through the math on Japan and the currency hit there and just how that math works because, again, I thought you had some natural hedges that made it -- might have made it a little bit less than this. So the first question is, just walk through the math on Japan. And also, is there anything else that's causing you to suggest it will be at the bottom of the range? Or is this really all currency?", "Dean H. Bergy", "So Bob, yes, we have talked in the past about kind of our FX situation. Relative to Japan, it is the one place where we don't have as many natural hedges. The natural hedges really come from being able to manufacture in a jurisdiction. So in Europe, we obviously have a lot of manufacturing. We really don't have any manufacturing in Japan. So for that reason, what we're seeing here is kind of an unprecedented change in this currency, with it being devaluated 20% or so since the start of the year. We're really seeing a more significant impact from that. There's -- and there's straight translation impacts, as well as impacts on our cost of goods sold, as they come across to Japan and to some other jurisdictions. So under normal times, we would be able to manage pretty well on a lot of currency changes. But Japan is one area where we get hit a little bit harder. And there is nothing else that's really impacting what we're talking about relative to the guidance here. It's just this really unprecedented change with the yen that's caused us to call this out and suggest that, right now, we'd be towards the lower end of the range if this continues.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, obviously, you guys have done really well in trauma. Some of that because of your own launches, some of that because of others being excluded from the market for awhile. I was wondering, given the really high-growth rates you're experiencing right now, if you could give us any sense, as we move forward, what you think a sustainable growth rate in trauma might look like as we get to kind of more normalized growth rates, if you will, over the course of the rest of this year.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. Thanks, Bob. It's clear our trauma business is seeing a lot of momentum. Similar to the fourth quarter, some of that was the impact of a competitive recall in Q4 that we talked about. About 1/3 of the growth was a result of that. This quarter, it was less than that, although we did still see some benefit. If you exclude that, we did see an acceleration in our trauma growth. And we feel really good about the momentum we're seeing there. Part of that is just having the opportunity to present to customers the breadth of our product as it's evolved over the last few years. And that's really helping us gain that competitive share. I wouldn't want to predict the growth going forward. We're seeing very strong momentum. I'm not sure I would extrapolate that in the models. That said, right now, there's a lot of momentum in that division and that group is really performing very, very well. And I'd highlight things like foot and ankle. I mean, that 50% growth for that segment is impressive, and that's been an investment there in the product launches we've had and putting in place a dedicated selling effort.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. Bob, it's Kevin. I'd just add 2 other comments, is that the trauma growth, if you look back over the past few years, has been really performing well. So even last year, the entire year of last year, we had terrific results. And that was absent the competitor recall. So this has been sustained strong performance, really over a number of years, in the trauma business. And on the foot and ankle, you could expect, certainly, the second quarter will continue to be very robust. And then we'll start to run against some comparatives that are a little strong, given the robust performance we had in Q3 and Q4 of last year. But certainly, we feel very bullish. It's a market expansion opportunity that's enormous, plenty of room for growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Could you please give us an update on what percentage of your revenue is in the emerging markets? And how some of the most recent acquisition, the integration, has gone in that market? And then also, given the ASR, what is your guidance for average share count for the year?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. Joanne, I'll -- Dean can follow up on the share count question. In terms of emerging markets, it's bumped up by about 1% with the acquisition of Trauson. It's still well below 10%. Around that 6% or so vicinity of our revenue comes from emerging markets. We did close the Trauson acquisition during the quarter. It's early. But today, we're pleased with the integration progress so far. But again, we're early on. It's an exciting opportunity for us to get into that value segment of the market, and we expect it to help be a driver of expanding our presence in emerging markets.", "Dean H. Bergy", "And Joanne, with the ASR in place right now, we would expect the share count to be right in the range of 383 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just to clarify there, Dean said it assumes no additional share buyback over the balance of the year?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes.", "Dean H. Bergy", "I mean, that assumes we don't do any additional buyback in those numbers. So that's our guidance, assuming we stay where we're at. Obviously, we still have $750 million outstanding.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Let me just ask kind of maybe 2 follow-ups. So one, if I look at the performance across your specialized sales forces, if I look at the foot and ankle performance, if I look at the sports medicine performance, if I look at the CMF performance, all very, very strong. And a lot of what -- particularly this quarter, it is driving the company.", "Can you just talk about how you think about that strategy in the context of your other businesses and whether there's an evolving distribution strategy here at Stryker that you potentially want to take advantage of, because, obviously, the growth in all those businesses is above market? It's been aided by what you've done on the distribution side. What is that -- where do you -- how do you run with that to make that a bigger opportunity for the company? And the second, I just want to clarify in the endoscopy business, which was light, I think, probably versus the street's expectations, do you -- was that any -- was there a timing issue with any of that? And do you recapture some of that potentially in the second quarter or over the next couple of quarters?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Why don't I take the second part and then Kevin can address the first part of your question. There was some timing impact so, yes, we would expect momentum in endoscopy to improve as the year goes on. The timing is related to that communications segment of our business. Again, that's primarily composed of products, such as the Endosuite. It's 100% capital. Some quarters can be stronger or weaker just on the timing of orders. So yes, we would expect to recapture that. Camera growth, that we're very pleased, mentioned the double-digit momentum there. So it really is primarily related to that comm segment.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "And with respect to your first question, Mike, I think it's a great observation. We absolutely believe in dedicated sales forces, where you have specialized surgeons and, in some cases, we call it specialists serving specialists. And it's definitely paid for us, and it's paid off for us with focus and in really truly understanding the customer. The podiatric surgeon, as an example, was largely neglected by large device manufacturers. And they feel really embraced by us. And Stryker foot and ankle is actually now a strong brand. Same -- I can say the same for sports medicine. CMF was really the first pioneer for us in this area, and what we've also found is these specialized sales forces actually operated with much lower inventory. So they're actually profitable, because they don't have the same requirements of the large joints, which is the huge instrumentation sets and the accompanying instruments. So they can actually hold their inventory in what we call a trunk-stock model. So it's a very efficient model. It's a model that works very, very well. Certainly, we're looking at expanding this. And in fact, in Europe, we're exploring some specialized sales forces. I know it's a market that not everybody's excited about. But if you have the right products and you have the right surgeons, you can certainly pursue growth. So the answer is, yes, we're looking. But the product and the surgeon type really have to line up well. And we took the learnings from CMF, applied those learnings to our sports medicine business, and to foot and ankle. And obviously, we're enjoying very good success thus far.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Swann.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Maybe just on foot and ankle, can you guys talk about your growth relative to the market? And what the components are there? I mean, is this mostly your ability to capture price and mix? Or is anything underlying in the market that's driving that?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So the market estimates are a little challenging to come by here, but we estimate it's around 15%. Certainly, Wright Medical has historically been the largest company in foot and ankle. And with our explosive growth over the last few quarters, we're certainly close behind them. But it's really more about market expansion. The sheer number of procedures, if you look at hammertoe procedures, bunions, implants weren't really used historically. So this is really a mark -- more of a market expansion story than a market share story. And I think the mark -- what we'll see is market growths are going to continue to climb. But if you go by the latest estimates from both our company their company, it's kind of in the 15 sort of percent range. Our 50% [ph] , clearly, we had a bit of a softer comparable in the prior year. And as I mentioned, as the year unfolds, I think we'll see that growth rates start to moderate a little bit but still a very, very significant room to expand with procedural growth.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then just one follow-up on your knee business. Can you just explain what -- does your Otis -- does the OtisMed, being off the market, does that disadvantage -- create any disadvantages for you while these competitive products begin to gain steam as you expect in the back half? And do you think you can offset that with enhanced or stepped-up DTC efforts in Triathlon?", "Katherine A. Owen", "So we do plan to continue the DTC campaign, but that's really not being driven in any way by whether or not OtisMed is on the market. The revenue impact was immaterial in the quarter. Obviously, we did lose some ShapeMatch. But given the relatively low penetration rate, we don't think that's going to be a major challenge. Obviously, we want to get it back on the market, and anticipate that happening. But I don't think that's going to be a major rationale for customers, in large numbers, switching to competitive products.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Mizuho Securities.", "Michael Matson - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "My first question is just on Trauson. I was wondering if you could tell us what sort of growth that business saw in the first quarter and then what your expectations are for Trauson in the Chinese orthopedic market. And then I have a follow-up question.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. The revenue contribution, given the timing of when we closed it, was really minimal in the quarter. And just given the size of that division, I don't think we're going to start to break out the growth rates for that. Obviously, we did comment on seeing double-digit growth for our emerging markets business overall, but I don't think we're going to get down to the level of providing segment growth or -- for that business.", "Michael Matson - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then in your neurovascular business, on the TREVO product, just wondering -- obviously, there's a huge market opportunity there. But some of the clinical data that's come out recently on the endovascular treatment hasn't looked so good in comparison to just the regular IV-tPA. And it actually sounds like there could be some reimbursement pressure there. So I was just wondering what your outlook is for that product right now.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, I think the studies you're referring to were really focused on the prior-generation or first-generation product and given this is a space where you see a lot of technological advancement in fairly short periods of time. But that study was from a product that was on -- originally launched a number of years ago. This is early on in these products' development. And there's going to be work to do to develop the market. But overall, we continue to be very excited, both for the prospects within hemorrhagic as well as our ischemic business, in total, for the neuro segment. That's been a great addition to our portfolio, getting into that space and expanding our presence there. I think it is a fair comment about reimbursement. We're going to have work to do, as you would in any new space when you're developing a new treatment modality. But I don't think that study changes the prospects we see for that market development.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "And certainly, our customers don't really seem fazed at all by the study, given they're very, very small sample sizes and it was really almost 3 generations ago. It was very, very old product, and it's evolved very significantly since then. So the promise for ischemic stroke is still very significant.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "On the gross margin side, excluding the medical device tax, it sounds like there's a fairly decent underlying improvement year-over-year. Can you just maybe help us think through the components of that? Because it sounded like, I don't know if I misheard you, Dean, on the call, there were some sort of maybe onetime-ish items in there that were a benefit. But help -- can you maybe help us understand the underlying gross margin trend and the factors influencing that?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Yes. Again, as we talked about the underlyings, we talked about adjusted gross margins. So for the current year, it's 67.5%. But that includes 100 basis points for a reduction for the medical device tax. The prior year adjusted gross margin was 67.8%. So the benefit that we got on the underlying has really come from 3 places. We are managing our inventory better, and that's resulted in lower inventory charges for things like excess and obsolete inventories. We did get some favorable product mix in the quarter, so that's the second component. And then the third component, which we've continued to talk about, is this 5-year plan that we have, or continuing plan, to continue to take cost out with our global quality and operations group. So that's really the third element. So if -- again, if you go through that math and take into account the fact that we did absorb the medical device tax -- excise tax this quarter, you're right, we did have those underlying factors that improved our margin year-over-year.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe as a follow-up on the question on Trauson, I think the last time I met with them, they had quoted there [ph] the Chinese orthopedic market growing in the 30% range, which, at the time, sort of dominated by local players. Can you maybe just talk about your view of that market? And then what impact you and Medtronic, owning some of the larger players, might have on competitive position for multi-nationals versus locals?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say if you're referring to the value segment of the market, we do think it's probably growing somewhere in the 20% to 30% vicinity in China. We do believe it's going to be the fastest-growing segment of that market and then, will become a larger component going forward. For us, and I can't speak for Medtronic, we really viewed the acquisition of Trauson, it was a way to get some brand recognition. It's now in the market for over 2 decades. Obviously, if we invested starting now, we're not going to have that. They've got a presence there, and a capability in terms of their manufacturing expertise that was targeted at that value segment. We, like Medtronic and other multi-nationals, tended to be more focused on the premium segment. So for us, it was a way to balance out our offering and expand into both the premium and, more importantly, longer term, the value segment of the market.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. I'd just add, I had a chance to visit Trauson last month, and I'm very excited with the management team that's in place. We have Aiguo Wang, who is a longtime Stryker veteran, who's the General Manager of that business, and he is on the ground in China. Our integration team is well under way. And so far, everything is going very, very well. So it's an acquisition we feel very excited about. Again, it's early in the process, but certainly, the kind of growth numbers you suggested are still in play. And we feel that it's going to be very significant over time. The last point I'd make is, we are running Trauson very separately. So we have the premium segment in China and Trauson. The 2 General Managers are reporting up separately. They don't report to each other. So they're very, very separate businesses. If we -- and now that we've completed the acquisition, we're able to look at all of the dealers. And the distribution network is actually completely separate. There really is no overlap, because they're calling on different hospitals. So again, a very additive acquisition.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Dean, just maybe a quick margin question. If I look at the SG&A leverage this particular quarter, it was particularly strong, as it was last quarter as well. And you, obviously, talked about currency being a headwind. But obviously, the SG&A leverage or improvement there is probably one of the factors that's offsetting the hits from currency. So what is driving that underlying improvement the last couple of quarters? And now for 1.5 years, we've talked about shared services and optimization. Are we ahead of plan as it relates to that? And typically, you see improvements at Stryker across the quarters if you start off strong? And is that the type of trend we should be expecting?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Well, I think we did a pretty good job with G&A spending this quarter vis-\u00e0-vis the prior year. But I would tell you that we've got a long ways to go. There's still a lot of opportunity in G&A specifically, relative to some of the things that you mentioned, shared services. I mean, frankly, we're just at the nub of what we can do there. Obviously, Bill Jellison's here, I think third day on the job here. But I know he's done these kinds of things in the past. And I think it's something that, obviously, he's going to be attacking as he comes on board here. So I appreciate the compliment, but I think there's a lot of real work to be done. And I think the organization is committed to getting after it.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Is there something onetime in nature that explains the levers, so we can assume this is good, old-fashioned, organic improvement?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Yes. I don't think there's anything that's specific. We did have the prior year CEO severance cost, which I mentioned there, of $8 million. So year-on-year, that's obviously a factor in what you see here, too.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And just maybe a quick follow-up for Katherine. I know you talked about the strength in trauma, just -- I didn't hear specifically, what -- Katherine, what do you think is driving that strength? Are we still seeing benefits from the nail recall -- competitor's nail recall? Or are we starting to see more strength in core trauma?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say yes and yes. So there was some benefit from the competitive recall. It was about 1/3 in the fourth quarter. It was somewhat less than that in the fourth -- in the first quarter. It gets increasingly difficult to get really specific. I would say underlying growth probably did accelerate for our trauma business heading into the first quarter. I wouldn't point to any specific product. I think we've had the opportunity to really get in front of customers. And as Kevin has mentioned previously, really show them how much we have expanded our product offering, not just this year, but over the last few years, as we've invested. And we are much more capable of going toe to toe with anybody in the market, given the breadth of the bag. So it was an opportunity that allowed us to really leverage that product offering. So I don't think all of that business that we picked up will stick. Less of it stuck in the first quarter. But at the same time, our core business is accelerating from the fourth quarter. And candidly, we'd rather see the growth that way.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And what we're really seeing is full account conversion, something that we were incapable of doing 3 or 4 years ago. And that started really last year. So if you look at our growth, 26% is a pretty impressive growth, given that the first quarter of last year we grew at about 13%. So this has really been steady, solid improvement, a very stable management team, and launching really a slew of products over the past 5 or 4 years that have filled up our bag, that enable us to do full account conversions. And that's where we're getting big chunks of growth. And these are accounts, obviously, all across the United States. We still have room to improve outside the U.S. But in the U.S., this has been a 4- or 5-year process. And we still have a ways to go.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So your instrument sales growth decelerated in the quarter versus Q4. And I understand that the Neptune recall impacted it, but that was seen in both quarters. And so my question was kind of, if you could give some color as to that deceleration. Would selling days have that much of an impact? I would have thought not so much. So any help there would be appreciated.", "Katherine A. Owen", "You will see the selling day impact. We had 1 extra in the fourth quarter and 2 fewer in the first quarter. That's -- the straight math is 2.5%. It probably impacts our capital businesses a little less so, but that's tough to tease out with specificity. So I wouldn't highlight anything in particular that we would view as issues. We'll continue with the launch of our power tool. Though, obviously, we're getting further into that launch now. The biggest challenge right now, that, that division is facing is, obviously, the Neptune recall.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then if I contrast the CapEx spending in beds, which came in pretty strong, I think, in line with expectations versus endoscopy, where you called out kind of the communication side, what's driving kind of the difference there? Is -- are you seeing stronger spend in one category than the other? Or can you kind of help contrast those 2 dynamics that we're seeing?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. I mean, it's not like every capital business all goes in the same direction in any given quarter. For example, medical had tougher comparisons -- or excuse me, had easier comparisons versus a year ago. And that's not necessarily true for our other capital businesses. I would simply point to the fact that any of our capital businesses are going to be variable from quarter-to-quarter, regardless of stability of the markets. In general, it's going to be more so for medical. It just happens that, this quarter, they were benefiting more so from a comparison. Whereas endoscopy, the timing of some of the communications sales were such that it offset some very good growth that we saw, with that double-digit gains for the camera segment, which, obviously, speak to the receptivity of hospital customers for capital purchases.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So you kind of sort of have to look at it over a series of quarters. And really, over a series of quarters, you'll see that the endoscopy business will pick up. We anticipate that through the course of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Taylor of Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So just a clarification on your prior comments. Katherine, you were talking about the normalized hip and knee growth. I just wanted to confirm you're talking about volumes and not dollars.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. When we talked about the low- to mid-single-digit growth, that's -- for us, that's what we're kind of walking around, what the market growth is for hips and knees.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, great. Okay. In the last quarter, you had a pretty nice uptick in America's hip and knee sales and you attributed some of that to your DTC advertising. I was just curious if you saw that again, if you're continuing that program. And any feedback on the success you're having there?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. We feel really excited about the DTC program, and we played around with the mix a little bit, in terms of how much television we've done versus how much print and how much Internet. In January, we were a little bit quiet on television. We resumed television in February and have seen the same kind of metrics in terms of surgeon locator searches, clicks to the website. And obviously, after you have the TV ad, it takes a couple of months, 2, 3, 4 months, before the patient actually will present for a surgery and where we'll see revenue. But all of the indicators are still very, very strong, and we have a compelling concept. It's working. Certainly, we had a terrific year in the knee business last year, as you saw. Obviously, slightly moderated in the first quarter. But it's nothing that causes us any alarm, and we are going to continue to invest. We are going to continue to play with the mix in order to really maximize the return on investment. And as you'll see -- you'll see us sort of coming on and off, but TV will remain part of our media mix throughout the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Can you give us some color behind your spine numbers in the quarter? They did come a little bit below our expectations, and I know you did have a very strong 4Q. So is it possible that 4Q stole some sales? Or is there any just slowdown in the market? Any color would be helpful.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, that -- I think it's fair that the seasonality comments we made for Recon are true for any of our implant businesses that have an elective component. And certainly, spine falls in that category. First quarter, it is, in the U.S., up against tougher comps versus a year ago. There's nothing that we would call out. That business is still finding its feet in terms of what the underlying market growth is going to be and, candidly, what our growth is going to be. But we've got a good team in place there, continuing to round out the bag and the product offering. And I think you'll see some movement quarter-to-quarter, but there's nothing in the first quarter that we would call out as a significant change in that outlook.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And just as a follow-up, pricing. Most companies are commenting about U.S. pricing being down mid-single digits. Is that still a fair assumption? And have you seen any change in payer pushback this quarter? Most companies are saying there's no change year-over-year.", "Dean H. Bergy", "Yes. I would say our pricing is -- mirrors the comments of the others.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Katherine, on sustainability solutions, did I hear correctly that it grew mid-single digits this quarter? And if so, it's a little bit below trend. Could you talk a little bit about what's going on there and the outlook, please?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, your comments are correct. I would say, what we saw in the quarter was partly due to competitive product launch and that we're going to be filing a 510(k) for. That's a phenomenon that you're going to see in this business. We launch a product that we have clearance to re-process. The competitor will launch a next-generation version of it. And you can imagine, we don't really get a heads up on that. So there's typically a little bit of a lag time as we get the product and get the clearance for that. So that was one of the key components that impacted that growth year-over-year. We continue to feel really good about the momentum in that business, though.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And adjusted for days, it was actually high-single-digit growth. So Dean's commentary was all kind of on an as-reported basis. And obviously, with the selling days adjustment, it was high-single digit, a slight deceleration from where it's been in the past couple of quarters. But again, nothing that causes us any concern. We still feel very bullish about that business.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And then your foot and ankle business is obviously doing very well. But you haven't talked about another area of extremities that's also growing nicely, the shoulder market. Could you, Kevin, maybe give us a little bit of an update on what you're doing there? What you're seeing in your business? We've heard, anecdotally, that Stryker is putting more of an emphasis on the shoulder market.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So as you probably know, last year, we launched our total -- new total shoulder. But we have not yet launched our reverse shoulder. That's going to be launched a little bit later this year, probably around the middle point of this year. Once we have the reverse shoulder out in the market, then we can really go after significant growth. So shoulder is actually -- and if you look at the joint reconstruction, it's actually not a very, very big part of our portfolio, something that will be a big growth driver in the future but, thus far, until we have the reverse on the market, will not be a huge growth driver. On the other hand, if you look at the sports medicine implants, the all-suture anchor, certainly used for rotator cuff, which is also used for hip FAI procedures. But certainly, the huge growth in the shoulder in our sports medicine business, which you -- which I indicated, grew over 50%. So shoulder will be more and more important. And as you know, there are more and more specialist surgeons, upper extremities or shoulder specialists. We'll be calling on those much more aggressively after we have the reverse shoulder on the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I was wondering if we could just take a step back. I know, Bill, you've just joined for a couple of days now. But maybe if you can just share your perspectives on what attracted you to join the Stryker management team, and any kind of preliminary thoughts that you might have, just in terms of company strategy, your approach to capital allocation. And just kind of what will be your priority here over the next 100 days or so, outside of, obviously, just kind of ramping up on the orthopedic and MedSurg businesses?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. I think from -- as far as a reason for joining, I think it's -- there's a number of different ones that, obviously, came up and hit on a number of fronts. Stryker is, obviously, one of the top 10 med tech companies in the world. It's got a culture and a management team, I think, that seems to be a great fit. Stryker also has a stellar kind of reputation for the growth over a long period of time. It's well positioned within some, I think, very attractive markets with a vast portfolio of products. As you mentioned, the balance sheet is already extremely strong. They've got fantastic cash flow. And obviously, that cash flow should be able to be used for additional growth opportunities, both inside and outside of the organization. And I think that it's pretty clear that there'll also be a component of that, that allows for additional return of capital to shareholders. On top of all that, I'm actually originally -- our whole family is originally from Michigan, so this is kind of a return home from that perspective. So I think it's a real great fit overall, and we're looking forward to it.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Welcome aboard. And then just one other question, I guess, just kind of relating to the Boston Scientific or former Boston Scientific Neurovascular business, can you just remind us where you are in terms of transitioning that business from a manufacturing perspective? And are we now separated completely from Boston? And are there any sort of restrictions that are out there that are in place, that may be lifted over the next year or so, that would allow you to get a little bit broader into areas within, like, peripheral vascular or anything kind of below the neck?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Kristen, let me take the first part of that. We still have one piece to go in terms of the manufacturing transition, and that is -- will happen this quarter. We've got some Irish manufacturing to move over. We anticipate -- the other moves have gone smoothly. We anticipate we're well prepared for this. And then we'll -- it will go smoothly as well. So that's the one remaining piece, and we anticipate that will be done in this quarter.", "Katherine A. Owen", "And Kristen, with respect to your question about limitations, there's nothing that I'm aware of that would prohibit us from going into other segments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Kevin, in Katherine's comments, she stated that the ACA is unlikely to influence implant rates next year very much. We kind of looked at it, and it's clear that Medicaid-reimbursed patients consume less than commercial patients. But there is likely to be a step-up among the people who are uninsured. So I was just -- some clarity on that as to why you're pretty certain that you won't even see 0.5% or 1% in implant rate improvement. And secondly, just comment generally on the growth rate in the neurovascular segment this quarter.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So the first question, I would say, we're not saying we're not going to have a slight uptick. It's either neutral or a modest positive is how I'd characterize it. Very difficult to predict. Today, we see, certainly in the orthopedic market, if someone wants to get their joint replaced, they tend to get it replaced. And we, as you know, have a high Medicare, Medicaid population as it is. So for the vast majority of our businesses, we don't see a big swelling of patients as you would in, let's say, if we were in chronic care or other parts of the health care system. That said, we think the medical business could be a beneficiary, since patient satisfaction will become a much more important component, given that it helps preserve with their Medicare reimbursement, and a bed is a key component of the patient satisfaction. But for planning purposes, because it's so difficult to predict, we're really assuming that it's not going to be a positive. It may turn out to be a positive. But if it is, we believe it will be modest in nature. And the second part of your question was Neurovascular. We continue to have double-digit growth in Neurovascular and are very excited about the leadership there. As I mentioned earlier on the call, I had a chance to visit with the team recently, just a fantastic management team that came over from Boston Scientific that stayed intact. And certainly, they're extremely excited because Stryker is investing significant -- as you saw, we had 2 follow-on acquisitions, following the initial acquisition of Boston Scientific. They have an unbelievable R&D team. And getting a chance to look at their pipeline was absolutely exciting for me. So it's a business that we feel very, very good about.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Kevin, I apologize. I've been jumping between calls. If I ask something that's already been asked, just tell me. I'll go back to the transcript. But wanted to start with one bigger-picture question, just as with Trauson now in the fold, wondered how you feel about maybe a dual-branding strategy in some markets. Would you ever think about taking some of those trauma products into some of your core markets and looking at a dual-branded strategy?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So I did mention earlier on the call that we have a separate management team for Trauson, that's distinct from the premium brands. And obviously, within China, we're going to maintain the Trauson brand. Our intent is to export those products to other markets. And we have significant room to grow -- to continue to grow within China. And we also have significant room to grow in other emerging markets. So our next initial expansion will be to places like India, the public sector of Brazil, certain countries where they already have a robust value segment. Whether these kinds of products will then one day make themselves to more developed countries remains to be seen. It's certainly not our first priority, given the vast amount of growth that we can achieve, first in China and then in other emerging market countries. But our intent will be to maintain the Trauson brand with these products.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Right, great. That's helpful. And then just a housekeeping question. Katherine or -- could we just -- your selling days for the rest of the year? And then maybe on pricing, as the Japanese price cuts anniversary here in the second quarter, do we get an improvement in pricing next quarter? Or is that just a little cushion in case Europe gets worse and things like that?", "Dean H. Bergy", "So Jeff, this is Dean. We -- right now, there's one additional selling day in the second quarter and then pretty comparable year-over-year in the third and the fourth quarter. And relative to the Japan pricing, we do anniversary that in this quarter and, incrementally, that should help us. Although, obviously, the sales in that market are going down by virtue of the currency impacts. So -- but on the pricing front, it should help us incrementally. We don't anticipate that, that won't be an assist.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the spine and then a question on the hip. Just on the spine, just -- I think last year, and just correct me if I'm wrong, that biologics was driving a lot of the growth. So I wonder if you would be willing to cut the spread between the growth of the biologics and the metal as we went into the first quarter and then any pricing impact there? And then on the hip, I think Accolade's been out about 18 months now roughly. Just how long does a product cycle kind of last in this environment in contributing a little extra to growth? That's all I have.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So regarding the first question, we're not really going to get into spiking out all the different components of spine. But I would tell you that, in our first quarter, Orthobiologics was not a disproportionate contributor to growth. We actually did quite well in the metal business. It's really starting to normalize. But we're not going to really get that granular, certainly, not on this call. Then what was the second question?", "Dean H. Bergy", "Yes, relative to Accolade and...", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So Accolade -- actually, Accolade II was launched only in the second quarter of last year. So it's still fairly early in its launch. It's been wildly successful. And that's really the biggest contributor to our growth within our hip franchise. We've also launched a new hip at Academy, a version of Secur-Fit Plus, which is for fit and fill, surgeons that prefer that type of a hip stem. So the hip franchise, frankly, over the last 2 years, as you've seen, has been a very, very strong performer and really on the back of terrific products with hip stems, as well as the dual mobility cups. We've had strong growth all through last year and that continued in the first quarter of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "My questions have been answered. But Kevin, in terms -- just going back to spine again. Obviously, you had bounced around here", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just quickly, on the MedSurg business, just now you have a quarter under your belt of results and 4 months of interacting with customers. Can you give an updated view on expectations for U.S. hospital capital equipment spending this year and then, potentially, whether or not you're seeing any benefit from any allocation away from IT? And any benefit there for Stryker in Q1 or any expectations for -- throughout the rest of the year? And I have one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. As it relates to capital, I would go back to some of our prepared comments, where the market seems to be somewhat stable. We're not seeing any significant departure. We really -- we saw some of that IT impact during 2012. But other than the normal variability you see quarter-to-quarter, right now, the market seems relatively stable.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Would that include an expectation for modest improvement or growth in capital equipment spending in the U.S.?", "Katherine A. Owen", "There may be a slight increase. But overall, we're not assuming big growth rates or big changes in capital spending.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So just going back to our comments on the endoscopy business. Certainly, the capital component of that business, we anticipate -- that's our own business, where we sort of had a bit of a softer quarter. This quarter, we anticipate that, that will improve. But that's not a reflection of the market. The market is pretty stable. And our business, obviously, had some volatility from quarter-to-quarter. But I wouldn't call out any kind of change in the market.", "Joshua T.  Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just second -- secondarily, in Europe, Medtronic called out that they were seeing some weakness, specifically, in January. And I know Stryker has their own company-specific headwinds in play. But can you just comment on, outside of those headwinds, whether or not you saw any changes in Europe in Q1 and into April?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, there's really no change to any of the commentary we've been making, both in the first quarter and before that, about Europe. Nothing specific country versus what we've talked about previously.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. I think Medtronic clearly has a bit of a different business profile than we do. And I believe that they're -- that they followed up on their comment, really talking about the impact being more in the CRM or the cardiovascular space in specific countries, where we currently don't compete. So for us, Europe is more of the same, challenging market. It hasn't changed at all in the first quarter versus last year.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2013 results will be held on July 18. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me is Bill Jellison, who as many of you know, joined Stryker as our CFO in April; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations. With respect to today's call, I will provide opening comments and then turn it over to Katherine for additional details. And then Bill will cover the financials. We will then open the call to your questions.", "Our second quarter results were driven by solid and balanced growth, both geographically and across our 3 segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine. With Q2 sales of $2.2 billion, we delivered 5% reported growth and a 5.9% gain, excluding foreign currency and acquisitions. We benefited from 1 extra selling day in the quarter, which after adjusting for this, resulted in sales growth of 4.4%, excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions. Based on our first half results, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year sales target and are shifting our range of sales growth, excluding acquisition and foreign exchange, from 3% to 5.5% to 4% to 5.5%.", "The strong top line, along with operational efficiencies, is helping drive solid performance, highlighted by continued gross margin improvement, after adjusting for the impact of the medical device excise tax. While we are pleased with our operational performance, as discussed previously, our results have been adversely impacted by a substantial foreign exchange headwind.", "For Q2, foreign currency negatively impacted our per share earnings by roughly $0.04. However, with the sales momentum and effective cost control, we were able to partially absorb the foreign exchange impact and still deliver EPS of $1 a share.", "With respect to our geographic growth, the U.S. had another strong showing with sales up approximately 5%. Encouragingly, we saw improved momentum in our international business, which posted nearly 9% growth, excluding foreign exchange, and included 1.6% growth from the Trauson acquisition. We believe that the globalization initiatives put in place are having a positive impact across our international businesses.", "The European turnaround remains on track, as Europe registered positive growth in the quarter versus the prior year. We look forward to continuing this momentum in the back half of the year.", "Our emerging markets businesses continue to perform well, posting strong double-digit growth.", "Looking at our 3 franchises in more detail. On a global basis, Reconstructive sales were up roughly 6% on a reported basis, with 8% underlying growth, excluding foreign exchange. Growth was balanced geographically with a 6.3% gain in the U.S. and a 6.9% increase in international, after adjusting for foreign exchange and acquisitions. Hips continued to roll and U.S. knee growth of 2% appears to be in line with the market.", "Turning to trauma and extremities. We continued to see great momentum with double-digit gains in both the U.S. and international, led by our foot and ankle business, which posted 34% growth in the U.S. and 28% worldwide. Based on the first half performance for our foot and ankle business, we are now even with the market leader, which is a considerable achievement, given that this dedicated business unit was only created at the beginning of 2012.", "Worldwide MedSurg sales increased 4% on a reported basis, with year-over-year gains for all of its business segments, including strong double-digit growth from the 1488 Camera and System 7 power tools.", "Finally, Neurotechnology and Spine posted roughly 7% underlying growth, excluding foreign exchange and acquisitions, led by double-digit gains for Neurovascular and Interventional Spine.", "Turning to some other P&L highlights. Gross margin, excluding acquisitions and restructuring charges, declined 50 basis points year-over-year to 67.7%. However, this included approximately 80 basis point impact from the medical device excise tax. With R&D representing 6% of sales and up 14% from the prior year, we continue to make important investments in innovation for the future.", "Looking ahead to the remainder of 2013, as mentioned, we feel highly encouraged by the continued strong sales momentum, which supports growth at the upper end of our original range. We are pleased with our overall operational performance, but foreign currency has proven to be a major challenge in 2013 and has worsened further, since we announced our Q1 results, at which time we guided EPS to the lower end of our range.", "If exchange rates remain at current levels, we anticipate full year EPS to now be negatively impacted by approximately $0.20 per share versus the prior year. As a result of this increased foreign exchange impact, we are adjusting our EPS range to $4.20 to $4.26 versus our original target of $4.25 to $4.40. This revised range assumes we will offset approximately half of the full year foreign exchange headwind.", "Importantly, going forward, we will be implementing a currency hedging program to enable us to mitigate the earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange swings, which Bill will comment on shortly.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today's call will focus on an update of our Q1 acquisition of Trauson, as well as a preview of our upcoming analyst meeting, which will be held on September 4 and 5 at the Homer Stryker Center in New Jersey.", "With respect to Trauson, we closed on the deal on March 1 and we have been pleased with the performance to date, recognizing the relatively short period of time since the acquisition. With Trauson, we are now a leading player in the lower priced segment of the trauma market, as well as spine in China, which we believe will be an increasingly important market with robust growth potential. The deal complements our existing presence in the premium segment, but provides us access to a different customer base and dealer network.", "As it relates to the integration, we continue to make solid progress and are on track with expectations as it relates to all key activities. In order to ensure our organization remains focused on building our competitive presence in both the lower priced and premium segments of the Chinese market, we have separate leaders who are running their organizations independently. We remain excited about the prospects for this acquisition, both to expand our presence in China and longer term, to provide a platform that can be leveraged more broadly into the lower priced segments in other emerging markets.", "Turning to the analyst meeting. We will once again be holding this event at the Homer Stryker Center. For those of you who are able to join us on the 4th, we will be hosting a product fair focused on our neurotechnology businesses. Specifically, we will be highlighting our 6 key business units that address the neurotechnology market, including Neurovascular, Interventional Spine, neuro Powered Instruments, Navigation, Spine and CNS.", "With the acquisition of our Neurovascular franchise in early 2011, combined with the 2 additional acquisitions of Concentric and Surpass, Stryker is the leader in complete stroke care. But beyond these important businesses, we have additional product offerings that touch the key physician community, including neurosurgeons, interventional neuroradiologists and neurologists, with these products to be included as part of the neuro product fair. The format will allow for informal interaction with the key leaders of these businesses and an opportunity to better understand the key product offerings and how they relate to our broad neurotechnology portfolio.", "Following the product fair, on September 5, we will have our formal analyst meeting, which will include presentations from our key leaders with opportunity for extensive Q&A. We look forward to seeing many of you at the meeting in early September and hope you find the format and content helpful to better understanding not only Stryker's neurotechnology leadership, but our broader product portfolio.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "William R. Jellison", "Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was positive by 5% in the quarter, including a negative 1.5% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was a positive 6.5% and 5.9%, excluding acquisitions. We had a positive impact from an additional selling day in the quarter. And on a days adjusted basis, core growth was a positive 4.4%.", "EPS on a GAAP basis for the quarter ended at $0.56 per share versus $0.85 per share last year in the second quarter, while adjusted earnings per share was $1 per share for the quarter versus $0.98 per share in the second quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of approximately $0.04 per share from FX and $0.03 per share from the med tech tax.", "The income statement is exposed to both transactional and translational FX risks, while the balance sheet is just exposed to translational FX risk. We currently hedge transactions once they occur, but we don't hedge future transactions at this time, nor do we hedge any translation exposure. We are planning to implement a predefined layered transactional hedging program, beginning sometime in the third quarter, which will be fully implemented over the next year. This will help us mitigate the volatility of FX movements in the future.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter, primarily related to a $170 million increase in the charge associated with the voluntary recall of the Rejuvenate and ABG II modular hip stems. The adjustments also included an increase of $19 million for estimated settlement expectations for previously disclosed regulatory issues. We believe these are reasonable estimations of our exposure. However, no potential insurance offset that may be available to help cover some portion of the Rejuvenate recall has been included. We do expect to recover some benefit from insurance in the future and we'll also book that as a non-GAAP adjustment, when known.", "Looking at sales in the second quarter. Volume and mix contributed 7.8% to our top line sales growth and acquisitions added 0.6%. Price changes reduced sales by 1.9%. The price decline is in line with the decreases experienced in 2012, though. Currency, driven primarily by a significant weakening of the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar, negatively impacted our top line by 1.5%. We also had an additional selling day in the quarter, increasing sales by approximately 1.5% on average in the quarter.", "Looking at our reporting segments. Reconstructive products represented 44% of our sales in the quarter. And sales in this segment were up 5.6% as reported and grew 7.6% on a constant currency basis. On an average daily sales basis, after adjusting for the impacts of acquisitions and currency, Reconstructive sales were up 5% in the quarter.", "U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 6.3% in the quarter. Trauma and extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S., posting 19% growth, led by new products, sales execution and strong growth in both foot and ankle. Domestic hips and knees were stronger sequentially, growing 6% and 2% in the quarter, respectively. Knees are still feeling the impact from the absence of our ShapeMatch Cutting Guides, but the growth in this category still appears to be in line with the market.", "Our international Reconstructive business was up 9.4% in constant currency and 5.7%, adjusting for selling days and acquisitions. All regions posted positive growth with performance the strongest in the emerging markets.", "Next, our MedSurg product segment represented approximately 37% of sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 4.2% as reported and 4.8% on a constant currency basis. These results were led by growth from our Medical and Sustainability Solutions business. Medical increased by high-single digits and Sustainability returned to solid double-digit growth. Endoscopy posted mid-single-digit growth in constant currency. Instrument sales in the U.S. were hindered by the impact of the Neptune Waste Management System recall, which reduced sales by approximately $20 million in the quarter. And this impact, we believe, will anniversary itself mid-third quarter, which will reduce the year-over-year comparison issue to around $6 million to $7 million in the third quarter and eliminate that comparison negative drag by the fourth quarter. We look forward to getting this product back on the market once we obtain our regulatory clearance of the Neptune -- or on Neptune's 510(k).", "Our final segment, the Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 19% of the company's sales and delivered another good quarter. Sales increased 5.4% as reported and 7.5% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this segment was led by our IVS and Neurovascular business, which both posted solid double digit constant currency growth. Core spinal implant sales were up 1% in the U.S. and up double digit internationally on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of the Trauson acquisition, international core spine still posted growth in the mid-single digits.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2013 were 67.7%, compared to 68.2% for the second quarter of 2012. The med tech tax negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 80 basis points in the quarter. When compared to the same period last year, the rate was also negatively impacted by foreign exchange rates.", "Research and development expenses increased by 0.5 percentage points to 6% versus 5.5% last year in the quarter. And the 14% increase in R&D spending over last year reinforces our commitment in this area and our expectations for above-market sales growth.", "Selling and general administrative expenses, costs were -- represented probably about 45.9% of sales. However, included approximately $200 million of non-GAAP adjustments, including both the Rejuvenate and regulatory costs that were mentioned earlier. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $813 million or 36.7% of sales in the second quarter of 2013 versus 37.1% in the prior year's second quarter.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.3% in the second quarter compared to 24.1% last year in the same period. And again, that rate was primarily impacted by the 80 basis point negative impact from the med tech tax, FX movements and R&D expenditures, partially offset by operational efficiencies.", "Other income and expense in the second quarter were $21.3 million and that compares to $10.1 million last year in the second quarter. This represents a negative $0.02 per share impact on EPS this quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from lower interest income due to some lower interest rates and some higher -- or slightly higher transactional FX expense in this category.", "Our reported tax rate for the second quarter was 20.8%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.3% for the second quarter of this year.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, an increase of approximately $450 million compared to year end 2012. We also have $2.8 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet.", "And from an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended flat with last year in June at 58 days. And days in inventory finished the quarter at 166. That's actually down 1 day sequentially, but it's down 8 days when it's measured against the prior year quarter, as we're really driving a number of initiatives in this area as part of the operational improvement plan.", "Turning to cash flow. We had an excellent first half of this year, generating cash from operations of $592 million. That compares to $492 million in the prior year, which is an increase of 20.3% over the first half of last year.", "Finally, regarding share repurchases. In the first half of 2013, we repurchased approximately $250 million of our stock or approximately 3.8 million shares at an average price of $65.12. And we still have about $750 million available for repurchase under our current authorization program.", "Based on our solid sales achievement in the first half and the current economic and market conditions, we are projecting constant currency sales growth, excluding acquisitions, in a range of 4% to 5.5% for the year. And if foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% to 2.5% in both the third quarter and in the full year for 2013.", "As Kevin indicated previously, we are adjusting our guidance for our 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share to a range of $4.20 to $2 -- or to $4.26. This includes a negative impact from foreign exchange movements of approximately $0.20 per share compared to last year's average rates.", "Thanks for your support. And we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So Bill, just to start off with a financial question. My first question is, can you just highlight how the -- how FX impacted the gross margin this quarter? And then give us a little bit more detail on the hedging program and how that might impact the P&L going forward?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. As far as how it affects the rate, it's probably about 10 to 20 points negative impact in this period. And obviously, that's only one area that the rates actually has an impact on the overall performance. In general, as I talked about from an FX perspective, we're exposed obviously on both the transactional and the translational side of the equation. So we generate a significant amount of money and profits both in Japan and Australia and a number of other countries. But we also have transactional-related exposure, where we're selling products into a number of these countries that don't have natural offsets. Currently, the company only hedges those activities once the transaction already occurs. And on the layered hedging program that we're at least looking at and implementing on an ongoing basis, we'd be in essence looking out forward as far as 12 or 18 months and actually putting in different layers of purchases at different points in time throughout kind of that 12- or 18-month period of time. So that we're buying the currencies that we need to have in those periods consistently through that period. And what that does is it just mitigates or buffers some of the highs and lows associated with those exchange rate movements in any one period. So hopefully, that helps kind of explain that. And I'd be glad to get into it more if you've got further follow-up questions.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "No. Just for my other follow-up, I wanted to ask Kevin a question, but thank you for that. And Kevin, I just wanted to get your quick update on the competitive knee landscape. Obviously, as everyone's been talking about for a while now, there's a couple of new knees in the marketplace. And one of the other competitors that have reported so far have mentioned that there was some trialing going on. Your numbers seem pretty solid here. So just -- has your opinion changed now that we're another quarter into the competitive launches on the potential impact from those competitive launches? Just an update would be great.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, sure, Bob. Thanks. What I would say is basically consistent with what I said last quarter, that it's going to take a while before we really see if there'll be an impact. I would say, not before the end of the third quarter will we have a good sense. We feel pretty good about our knee performance. It's in line with the market, despite the fact that we have our ShapeMatch Cutting Guides off the market. So we feel we're doing well. We hear noise a little bit here and there about trialing, but it's very minor at this stage. And like I say, we're not going to have a good understanding probably until the end of the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink Swann.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Just a kind of housekeeping. I think you had given the impact of selling days on the overall Recon business, just can you parse that out by hips and knees?", "Katherine A. Owen", "There isn't -- Rich, it's Katherine. There really isn't any real variability between hips and knees. So the math that we quoted on the call would hold. And it's 1.5% overall. There is -- if there's any variability, it would be more related to our capital business that tend to be less impacted. But for consistency's sake, we apply the same math each quarter and don't try and adjust because the swings aren't that meaningful. So I wouldn't expect any variability.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And on the knee side, can you maybe give us a sense of where you are with getting ShapeMatch back on the market? When might we expect that? And also, your direct-to-consumer initiative in knees for the GetAroundKnee, can you describe what updates you might have on the impact that's having on the business and what your plans are going forward with that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, no problem. We filed the Otis 510(k) during the second quarter. And it's difficult, as you know, to predict when the 510(k) clearance may materialize. We're hopeful sometime this year. But obviously, that's going to depend on a number of variables. We have been continuing with the DTC campaign, although the mix of media varies just depending on some of the analysis we've done, which is very consistent with what we said on prior updates. That's not a departure of any type. And we continue to believe that the Triathlon Knee, as the only single-radius knee on the market, has some unique benefits, as well as some extensive clinical history that we believe will help us remain very competitive. And we're pleased with the growth that we saw, recognizing there's always some impact. Not massive, but some impact, given the ShapeMatch is not available in the market right now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So Kevin, it would be great to hear from you what you think drove the strong improvement in your international hip and knee growth and the sustainability of that?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, so sure. As you know, Europe, the turnaround story has really -- really began last fall. We put a lot of new leaders in place. We've really focused the company on turning that around. We've had great exchanges with our U.S. counterparts, the head offices in U.S., to help drive that growth. We've also sent over one of our top leaders, who is leading the knee campaign in the U.S. He's now living in Europe and helping to run the orthopaedic group in Europe. So I would say, it's a number of factors leading to sustained performance. And we've seen the improvement gradually coming. It came through, obviously, very clearly in this quarter. But it's only 1 quarter. So I don't want to get ahead of ourselves. I think we need to see that sustained. But I really can't point to one thing. It's a real focus commitment, really starting with leadership and alignment. And driving what we have, our great products. And we just have a disproportionately lower share in Europe than we do in the U.S. and to other markets like Australia, Japan, Canada. And so that's really the key point -- part of the turnaround, Europe being a negative sales over the last few quarters finally turning to positive sales this quarter.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "And then for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about pricing because it did deteriorate in recon. And that was a little bit surprising to me given that you lapped the Japan cuts on April 1. So could you talk a little about where you saw pricing deteriorate? Was it the U.S., Europe; hips, knees? And how confident are you that it doesn't get worse, at least in the near term, from that negative 3.4% we saw this quarter?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. It did worsen, I think by about 80 bps or so versus the first quarter. Remember, we did anniversary the Accolade launch in the second quarter last year. So there were some benefit that we saw. There was nothing significant I would call out or some change in trend. We've been saying that hip and knee pricing is likely to remain under pressure somewhere in the low-single digits, partly offset by mix, which is going to vary quarter-to-quarter. But there was no significant departure from that.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. I would not characterize the market as deteriorating in terms of price. I would say it's very stable. Stable in the low-single digit. From quarter-to-quarter, we do tend to see a little bit of variation, but it's nothing that concerns us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just for clarification, the 4.5% constant currency growth you're guiding to for the year, how much of that is acquisition revenue? Or is that organic?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "That's organic growth. 4% to 5.5%, excludes foreign currency and acquisitions.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Terrific. Second up, can you please comment on the capital purchasing environment at the hospitals?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Joanne, there's been no real change since our prior update. The market remains somewhat cautious ahead of unknown changes under the ACA for next year. So there hasn't been any significant improvement nor deterioration in what we're seeing as it relates to hospital capital spending. Recognizing our capital businesses tend to have more variability, even when there is no overall market concern. It's just the nature of that type of business. But there's been really no change in the environment since the start of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Taylor from Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, first, I just wanted to follow-up. It sounded like you started to answer the FX question that Bob asked. But given that hedging program that you talked about looking out 12 to 18 months, I guess my question is, you lowered the guidance for the year, but when will we start to see that have more of a stabilizing impact on FX as it rolls through the P&L? And can you comment on where those hedges would be located?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. So -- and that's a great question because, obviously, we've got exchange rates that are already moved, which is why as we look at the full year and look at what the expected impact for us is, it's still obviously a significant drag on this year. We believe that we're going to be implementing a layered hedge program, but that's built up over time. And that's really to protect us against kind of future rate movements. And again, a hedging program is only set up to mitigate that risk. It doesn't eliminate the risk. So as currencies change, you're ultimately getting the impact of whatever those currencies are changing to, unless you, one, either have some good natural hedges established for long term; and also to just mitigate at least or minimize what the volatility of that high or low on those rates are. So if you think of us begin putting in a layered hedging program, we would think we'd have it pretty much in place or largely in place by the time we get into kind of the first quarter or so of next year. And by that point in time, you're going to have multiple layers that are already being established in each one of those quarters. But for this specific year, we're still going to have fairly significant negative impacts based on where the rates are at today.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. And then just on spine, your spine numbers have improved a little bit. And a lot of people have been talking about improvements in the spine market. Have you seen any change in volumes or the behavior of payors or anything that's really changed dynamically?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No. And keep in mind that spine business includes both our traditional core spine business, as well as our Interventional Spine business, which is faster growing. It had another solid quarter of double-digit gains on the Interventional Spine side. We see no really -- no significant change in trends, in terms of whether it's payor pushback or just the underlying overall market trends. It seems to be moving towards greater stability, but it's still an overall challenging spine market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Matt Blackman - Stifel", "This is actually Matt Blackman here for Rick. Just a couple of questions. Are you able to comment at all about the incremental cost of implementing this hedging program?", "William R. Jellison", "So there's really not a lot of additional incremental cost associated with the hedging program. All the hedges that we would be layering into are really forward contracts. And those are done at kind of a very, very minimal related cost aspect of that. So there should be nothing associated, at least materially associated with anything with the hedging program itself.", "Matt Blackman - Stifel", "Okay. That's helpful. And then the next question. You mentioned you'd fully anniversary Neptune in the fourth quarter. But just any commentary on getting it back to market?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Well, we have filed the 510(k), so we're awaiting FDA clearance. And similar to OtisMed, obviously, we have to respond to any questions from the FDA. And we're continuing to target sometime this year for the clearance, but this isn't a perfect science, as you know. So we're trying to give visibility around both the quarterly impact and the expected impact until we get the clearance. Which again, hopefully it's sometime before year end.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I wanted to follow up on the pricing question that was asked earlier, the 80 bps we're seeing in pricing. I guess I just wanted to go back to the kind of o U.S.-U.S. split because as Larry mentioned, there is that benefit from the Japan reimbursement cuts anniversarying. So I was wondering, does that imply that we saw a greater than 3.5% impact in the U.S.? Or if you can just maybe give a little color there, that would be helpful.", "William R. Jellison", "I mean, so first off, just a clarification of that impact. The impact on the pricing side is about a 60 basis point impact on the overall margin levels. The rates that are out there and what's being put together, as Kevin mentioned and as Katherine mentioned, the ranges of those price impacts actually are different quarter-to-quarter. And it's really based on some of the programs that people are putting into place. But nobody is really seeing any difference in the trends associated with that.", "Katherine A. Owen", "And also, keep in mind when we're talking about Reconstructive, as we show that category, that's not just hips and knees. So the pricing you're seeing is inclusive of some of our other businesses, as well, such as trauma and extremities.", "William R. Jellison", "That's right.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up, you're making a clearer effort here to step up your R&D spend this year. Can you talk a little bit about where that R&D spend is going and kind of when you expect to get the return on that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, our comments have been that we expect in any given quarter our R&D as a percent of sales to be somewhere in the 5.5% to 6% range. And it's going to vary quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, it was at the high end of the range that quarter as we continue to make investments that we believe are helping to drive the top line growth. So we don't expect any real change. That continues to be the expectation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I have a few questions, but I'll try to -- to narrow it to 2. One is, the cash flow performance this quarter. You kind of buried the lead a bit on that one when you put it into the text. So it's up 20% year-over-year. Can you just describe what drove that? Is there something in last year's comparison I should be aware of, because obviously that's a very strong performance relative to the underlying earnings.", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. I'd say that if you look at kind of last year's performance, I'd say that we had a weaker or softer cash flow on level in the first half of last year. But I think that, as you saw our inventory days in comparison, especially in comparison to 1 year ago, are down about 8 days. I think in general, we feel very good about kind of the cash flow level that we're looking at. And we should continue to be able to drive that at a solid layout -- or a solid rate.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. I'm going to sneak in 2 follow-ups here. First, just to understand the -- you're basically describing a current FX impact on your bottom line of basically 100 basis points as $0.10. Is it that high just because of what's going on right now is the yen and you have less hedges on your yen exposure than you do on your euro? Because I always thought that historical relationships, Katherine, the top line impact to bottom-line impact was less severe. So that's first. And the second, maybe -- I just wanted to go back to the cost of the hedging program. You described that the cost of the impact on the C&L of implementing a hedging program is relatively de minimis. I just want to make sure I understood that.", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. Absolutely. So a couple of questions there. The first question really deals with some of rate-related impacts and it really depends on which currencies are moving. So in some currencies, we have better natural impacts or offsets associated with it. But when you look at the Japanese yen, for example, and say the Australian dollar, the Australian dollar just in the last -- since the last call, in the last 3 months, has changed about 13% downward. So when we're selling in Australian dollars, but we're buying those products that are sold into that market in either dollars or euros, that's obviously a negative impact associated with it. Same with Japan. So Japan, we had very little, virtually no natural offsets there. Everything we're selling there is really being purchased outside of that region. So because we've had such a significant move in the yen and also in the Aussie dollar, and in fact in most commodity-based countries, that's actually having a more negative impact on us in this specific year than what we'd generally see, even with some higher volatility and rates. And as far as the cost of the program goes, again, there's obviously some additional ramp-up within kind of the treasury group to make sure that we can support that. But relative to the overall cost of both the organization and the cost of that program, it's relatively de minimis. As far as buying that, all we're really doing is we're purchasing the amount that we need in advance. So we're buying amounts, let's say for the second quarter of next year. And we're buying that at different periods between now and then. So that we don't just get exposed to whatever the rate is in that specific quarter, but it's layered in through a number of purchases up until that date.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew Dodds from Citigroup.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Quick one first, for Kevin. Now that we've had more than half of companies reporting in the second quarter and you look at the first and second quarter combined, the hip market continues to outperform the knee market, whereas you could argue demographics might be better for the knee market, there's more GTC spending there, you got the new product launches. I mean, is the difference, in your view, all elective? Or knees are just that much more elective than hips? Or is there something else out there?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. Matt, I -- thanks for the question. I would say that, that's a trend we've been seeing for a little while now and I would attribute it to the more elective nature of knee procedures. If you have hip pain and you're lying in your bed, you feel the pain; versus a knee, it can be deferrable and you could get HA shots or other things that can delay your procedure. So I would 100% attribute it to the more elective nature. Just on hips, I would have to say I'm extremely pleased with our performance in hips, given that we obviously had to undergo a recall starting last year. You have not seen our business go negative in hips, certainly in the United States, where the recall was most intense. In the third quarter of last year, we had a slight dip in our growth rate, but it was still positive growth. And what you've seen since then it's -- can sustain positive market-leading growth, in spite of having to manage our way through a recall. So I think that's a tribute to the leadership that we have in our recon group in the United States.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I figured you were just looking forward to signs on the hips. One quick one on trauma. Was there any benefit left from the mail recall of the competitor, or was that largely gone in Q1?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "At the end of Q1, they were largely back on the market. So what I would say is, we had a pretty pure quarter in the second quarter. And as you know, we've been growing above market in trauma for a number of quarters, frankly a number of years, certainly in the United States. It was nice to see our International Trauma business pick up as well. But feel very bullish and very confident with our Trauma business, our great leadership that we have in place. And very, very strong performance in the second quarter, again.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.", "Chris Hammond - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Chris Hammond in for David Roman. First question is related to the P&L. I think for the last 2 quarters now, I think you guys have come in with SG&A spend a little bit higher than what we were forecasting. And I'm wondering, A, kind of how that -- how we should be thinking about that for the rest of the year? And then additionally, how that plays in the context for EPS for the full year, when we strip out all the noise, whether it's FX or device tax. It looks like the total EPS growth rate is fairly robust and I'm wondering about the sustainability of that. And what are the various levers, up or down, either way?", "William R. Jellison", "Yes. So I guess, first off, just on the SG&A-related expenses. I think that we're doing a very good job on the covering of that side. We've got our expenses this quarter on an adjusted basis or about 36.7% of sales versus 37.1% last year in the second quarter. I think we had some pretty good first half related improvement. And I think, overall, that we're expecting to continue to -- especially if we can realize this level of top line sales growth, it does allow us to get some leverage associated with our overall business. And I think that that's our expectation moving forward.", "Chris Hammond - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Wonderful. If I could just squeeze in just 1 follow-up here. I curious a little bit about what's going on in Europe. Obviously, a turnaround seems to be well underway there. But then, there's some other numbers from the Trauson that's getting baked in there, too. But just outside of just the sales changes that you guys have made, what are you seeing in terms of a macro landscape there? Has anything changed since you were -- you've last updated at this, whether it's regard to austerity or competitive trends?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So first thing, I would start with the market. I would say that the market in Europe is -- had the same challenging market that it has been, frankly, over the last couple of years. Trauson sales are only in China. There's virtually no sales outside of China. So they're -- the impact in Europe is -- has nothing to do with Trauson. It's really our own operational performance. And what I would say is our actions, that we had lost market share for a number of quarters and we started to address that with vigor, starting in the fall of last year. I'm very pleased with our performance in the U.K., in France. Spain has really turned the corner and we had a very strong quarter in Spain. And a number of the other smaller countries, we've really -- with better leadership in place and more focused, we've been driving improvements. Italy and Germany actually improved versus the first quarter, but those are 2 countries were we still have work to do. And I -- we'd be looking for more improvement from those 2 countries later on. But this is really an operational improvement story. But we have to be honest that this is following a period of a number of quarters where we were underperforming the market. Our goal that we stated last year was to get back to market growth by the end of the year. We're obviously on that trajectory, based on a very strong performance this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to ask a question on the neurovascular business. I think you guys had mentioned there was double-digit growth in the quarter. Can you maybe just further expand upon that? And are all of the activities or shifts between you and Boston Scientific now complete from a manufacturing standpoint?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think, Kristen, yes. The final employees transferred over in April. So we are now essentially done with all of the major integration-related aspects of that deal, which is in line with what was expected when we did the deal a couple of years ago. And they continue to see very solid momentum. There's really no acquisition benefit in those numbers, just given how small the Surpass deal was. And so it's really a nice -- nice product flow and continuing to have good momentum across both the hemorrhagic and ischemic segments for the Neuro business.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. I'd say, Kristen, just to add one comment. The product launches have been terrific in coils. So in coils, we're clearly the leader and we're gaining market share pretty significantly with nanocoils, long coils, just a whole series of launches over the last few quarters that are really boosting that business. And as you know, we -- that management team stayed in place, as we acquired the business from Boston Scientific. And the R&D engine is really humming very, very well.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. And so overall, it sounds like you would say you're gaining share and where do you think the market is generally growing at these days?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I don't think there's any real change to our overall market growth expectations. It's somewhere in the 6% to 8% range. It's hard to get total visibility, given that a lot of the companies are -- the sales are a part of much bigger companies that it doesn't necessarily get broken out. But we think the overall market growth is probably somewhere in that 6% to 8% vicinity.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "And related to the comment on gaining share, we're gaining share in coils. Certainly, when you look at the ischemic market, as well as the history of the flow-diverter, the stent, we're still enrolling patients in the trials. We don't have that product on the market in the U.S. So our share gains are really in the plumbing segment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Navarro from RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two quick questions. One on the hip side, your hip numbers came in better than expected, particularly on the U.S. side. So I'm assuming you're taking market share. Can you confirm that? And then, what do you think that the U.S. hip market is growing? And a follow-up then, after that, on extremities.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, first on the hip market, obviously, not everybody has reported yet. I would guess that it's probably growing in the low single digit. We have been at the high ends of market growth for a number of quarters now. As I mentioned earlier, very excited about our hip leadership. We launched the Secur-Fit Advanced product recently, which was a fit-and-fill stem on the heels of Accolade II being launched a year ago. So we've had very good products flow, including our RMDM and ADM cups that we launched not so long ago. So it's been a very, very good product flow. And great execution in the field that's been driving above-market growth in hips for quite some time now.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then, let me just follow up on the foot and ankle side. You said the U.S. business was up 34%. We assume the U.S. foot and ankle market's kind of going in that 10% range. So 2 questions. One, has the market accelerated? And then 2, obviously you've taken share, do you know who you've taken share from?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, first of all, we love being in this market. It's a high-growth market. Until I read the reports, it will be hard to say exactly what the market growth is. But I would say the 10% to 15% range is probably about right for market growth. I think we are taking share from a number of players. It's a fairly fragmented market. I wouldn't say it's from 1 particular player. The bigger issue is that it's a market expansion story. So we're frankly more concerned with growing the market than we are with individual competitors, because there are so many implants that are not used today to treat hammertoe procedures or bunions. And then that's really where the bulk of our growth is really coming from, the electric procedure area, which makes up the vast majority of our foot and ankle business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew O'Brien from William Blair.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I was just hoping you could talk a bit about your capital equipment performance in the quarter. It was quite good, compared to what we've seen so far from a couple of other companies in this space. And I just wonder if Stryker is a little bit unique in the fact that it can bundle quite a few products across recon, neuro and then in MedSurg as well. Is that a dynamic that's benefiting you in this type of environment? Is it something that's been accelerating recently? Or can you just talk a bit about that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "We've been, as we've talked about in the past, increasingly looking to drive better cross-divisional coordination, but that is still very much in the early stages and I wouldn't want to characterize the performance of any of our businesses as being driven by that at this time. There's been no real change in the overall market backdrop, as it relates to our capital businesses and that we've seen year-to-date. Obviously, we saw very good momentum with the 1488 and System 7, which are capital. And both growing in the double digits. Medical's our most capital-intensive business. Over 90% of that business is capital. Again, hospitals seem somewhat cautious on some of their more deferrable capital purchases, but that's a very consistent trend we've seen throughout the year.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up to Derrick's earlier question on the R&D side. Three quarters in a row now of double-digit growth in that metric. Is the spend more related towards -- maybe a bit more allocation towards some newer areas that Stryker's not currently in, where you may have a call point? Or is it more just allocated in areas where you're currently at, i.e. spending on the neuro side?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So clearly as neuro takes on a larger portion of Stryker's overall business, you would expect a slight tick up in our overall R&D rate. So that's a business mix issue and as neuro does demand a slightly higher rate of R&D spending. But it really is an across-the-board commitment to really invigorating our pipelines. I've had the chance to travel to all of our businesses and do business reviews, including the pipeline. I'm very excited about what I'm seeing. At that stage, we tend not to want to talk too much about a lot of the new products, but you can see with our success with the 1488 and System 7, that new products are the lifeblood of the company. And we're committed and focused on continuing to drive above-market growth through strong investments in research and development.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Medical is clearly a lumpy business. It did well quite -- it did quite well this quarter. What's the kind of trend line that you envisioned for that business, now that you've have some more experience with it?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Bruce, I don't think we'd expect any major departure from what we've seen. Clearly, prior to 2008, we saw very strong growth in capital, but it was a different market environment. We feel there is some hesitancy, as we've said, around the ACA and just general uncertainty. You are right, this is a business that is -- it can vary considerably from quarter-to-quarter. Even where there isn't market uncertainty, that's just the nature of capital, more so for our medical than any of our other businesses. But there's been no real change in the outlook for that business than what we've thought at the start of the year.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just last quarter, you noted that in endoscopy, cameras are strong, communications was below par. Where do you think the -- where are you right now in that business?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. We obviously continue to see good momentum as we're going into year 2 with the camera, which was up double-digits, as Kevin referenced. Comm was down. Again, that is one of the most capital-intensive components, certainly of endoscopy, although the rate was considerably better than the declines that we saw in the first quarter, which was expected when we were on our last call. We would, based on trends, we'd expect a little bit, continued improving trends that relates to comm in the back half of this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Just a couple of follow-ups on some of the areas that folks have been asking after, one was on Extremities. And I have a follow-up on Capital and MedSurg. So on Extremities, would love to hear, understanding that your growth so far has been coming from some of the sort of discretionary procedures, hammertoe, bunions. Love to hear about maybe some of the investments that you're making in that business, in terms of distribution, maybe in terms of what -- where we can look forward to in expanding the product line, either in Foot and Ankle or Upper Extremities, it'd be very helpful.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, you are correct. The vast majority of the revenue in our Foot and Ankle business is associated with elective procedures, that we're very excited about the opportunity there. We've put in place a dedicated sales force for Foot and Ankle, which is largely a different call point than the Upper Extremities piece of the business. And we put that in place in the first quarter of last year. Very pleased with the focus. It's a formula that is tried and true within Stryker, bring a lot of focus and leverage what was a terrific portfolio of products with the Memometal acquisition. And continue to -- invest and expand in the market, which as Kevin mentioned, this is really about a market expansion story more than anything else. What we do longer term, whether it's in upper extremities or other areas, I think we'll just determine that, as we look at the opportunities. But right now, the bulk of our focus is really in that Foot and Ankle area.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Nothing immediately on the docket for back half next year, upper or further lower, that you can talk about?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "What I said in the upper extremities is we -- in the Shoulder business, in particular, we launched our new primary shoulder a year ago. And we have a reverse shoulder that's in our pipeline, which we hope to launch by the end of the year, or let's say around the end of the year. Once we have the reverse shoulder launch, that will really give us a complete portfolio. We would love to drive pretty significant growth. But we're not going to see much of that this year. That will be really more of a next year's growth opportunity.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Maybe a couple of questions for Bill and then for Kevin. Bill, just one quick one on currency and then a more strategic question. I guess on currency, can you just walk us through the decision to begin to hedge transactional, I guess? Is it a response to volatility in this particular quarter? Or is it really a response to the multiple disparities around FX over the last, kind of 6 to 8 quarters?", "William R. Jellison", "I really don't think it's actually either of those two. I think that maybe the highlight of that volatility, maybe, has caused us to look at it a little bit harder. But I think that it's just one of the areas that, as an organization, we need to look at to manage risk in general. And we obviously have exposures in a number of different currencies, both on the translation side as well as on the transaction side, as well as really on our balance sheet side. So I mean, we're just looking at it relative to the activities and the practices that we currently have in place and seeing whether we think we should have some additional programs in place to help mitigate any other risk in the organization. So I think it highlights it for us maybe this year a little bit more, just because it's having an impact. But even if the impact hadn't occurred, the risk level still existed. And we -- that's a program that we should have in place as an organization.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. I'd just like to jump in, just to make a quick comment. That obviously, Bill has years of experience with layered hedging programs. And I think bringing him on as the new CFO with a fresh set of eyes, there's a risk we had known about at Stryker and Stryker's has lived with this risk for many, many, many years. Rates have never moved with this kind of dramatic -- just in terms of intensity, as well as the shortness of the timeframe. So it's a risk we've known about, but it's a risk that never materialized in such a dramatic action. But Bill has that experience and, obviously, the two of us spent a lot of time talking about it. We really believe this is the right step to move forward with that will smooth out those variations. And then our true operational performance can shine through.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just going to be 2 more quick ones. The first is, maybe going back to Bill's significant experience. And Bill, one of the areas that I think investors are pretty enthusiastic where you can bring some of your leadership is on shared services. And I imagine, as you've been there -- have you been there long enough to kind of get a sense of where Stryker sits on shared services. And relative to some of the cost numbers that Stryker has proposed, how do you feel about those numbers and your ability to implement shared services with the broader team? And over what time frame do you think that's appropriate? Then one quick follow-up for Kevin.", "William R. Jellison", "Well, I mean, a couple of things here. One, we -- I think the organization is already in a -- it's in a good position. I think it's starting from a strong foot on a number of different activities, as well as just with the strength of its overall business performance. And yes, I think that we can definitely make some continued improvements here, looking forward, especially as we see kind of the areas that we're going to be growing sales and focus. But specifically as it relates to shared services, while I've had a chance to look at really each one of the 3 different regions right now and, yes, we've been talking through a number of different opportunities on -- and activities. I think that, one, that's going to migrate over probably many different years. Again, that's not something that just happens overnight. But I think that we've got some good opportunities in a number of areas to just make sure that we're looking at even best practices within Stryker, let alone kind of broadly external to Stryker, because I think we're doing a lot of really good things already within the organization. We just need to maximize on that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Just 2 questions here. One is, for the hip recall, I think it adds up cumulatively to about $384 million, if my math is correct. And correct me if I'm wrong. And I think the original range was between $190 million to $390 million. Should we expect an increase in that range?", "William R. Jellison", "I think, one, you should expect us to reevaluate that at the end of every quarter. And I think that we did have some run-off on some expectations. And I think that mostly that's because of, kind of a communications and how we're looking to see and get a good assessment of all the activity out there. I don't think you should expect -- you shouldn't expect it and we shouldn't expect it. I think the numbers that we've got out there are the range that we're currently expecting, based on the kind of the current trends and low levels of expectations moving forward. If it does change within this quarter or within the next quarter or anytime in the future, we'll be reassessing that and trying to give us at least our best estimate of what that new range may be. And it could actually move in either direction. And as I mentioned, the range that we do have out there today does not include any potential offset from any insurance recovery on the backside. And we don't want to book anything associated with that until, obviously, we get closer to understanding exactly what that may be. And if we do book some, that will be, as well, a non-GAAP related adjustment that we'll highlight for you.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "Okay. And then just on the hip. And it's been kind of beat up a little here. It was a great quarter, 6% on a 5% comp. The comps are getting tougher. You did announce or talk about some new products that have rolled out. I mean, how much longer do you think you can keep, kind of staying at the high end of the market in terms of hip and really taking share? Is this -- should we expect a reversion to the mean, now that new product cycles are starting to slow, or can you maintain at the high end?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, I would say that moving back to the mean is never an objective, obviously. We've been above market for, I think 8 quarters in the United States. At least 8, if not more than 8. And in the middle of that, we had a recall. A pretty significant recall. So I feel really strongly about -- I just had a review this week -- earlier this week with our hip business in Mahwah and very excited about the cadence of new products over the next few years. They shared with me, the execution in the field has been fantastic, dealing with this recall and then continuing to sell and not making excuses for it. So I believe we can continue to sustain market leadership. That doesn't mean every single quarter we'll be #1, but we certainly have a terrific product portfolio that's existing. Accolade II still is continuing to grow at robust rates. So even though it was launched a year ago, it's certainly not reached its maxim. Same with our mobile bearing hip offerings and close cuts are still gaining traction. A lot of surgeons use those initially in revisions, but they're having great success and now they are thinking of using those cups in primary procedures. So we still have very good runway with the new products that were launched, let's say 1 year to 2 years ago, in addition to the Secur-Fit Advance that was just launched. And they -- we do have a pipeline looking ahead that excites me. So I don't -- would not expect us to suddenly fall off on hips. But from quarter-to-quarter, any one quarter, somebody might nudge a little bit ahead of us. But we're certainly playing for market leadership for the long term here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer and Company.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on endoscopy. You mentioned that comps will even with Neptune in the back half. But you did just anniversary the 1488 launch. Where are we in that launch? Is this a multi-year type of launch, like we've seen in hips and knees? Or are you pretty well out there in terms of the rollout?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. The 1488 launch got underway late in the second quarter of last year. If you recall, we had some initial glitches, which is not unusual when we start to get the products out, used broader in the field. And since that time, we've started to see, obviously, accelerating momentum. I'm really pleased. So they're now going into Year 2. And as we get certainly to the back half of Year 2, the comps get more difficult. It tends to be a roughly 3-year cycle, same with our power tools. So Year 1 to Year -- the first 18 months, the strongest growth. And then you'd start to see a greater moderation, as you start to get to the tail end of the cycle. And there'd be no difference with that with the 1488.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. But in this quarter, it was strong double-digit growth. So when -- I would not say we're at the anniversary stage. And we have good expectations in the second half for endoscopy. The camera should continue to grow well. And in addition, Katherine mentioned earlier the Communication business, the drag that we had in the first 2 quarters was certainly lessened in the second quarter and should start to turn modestly positive in the back half of the year.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "And then, Bill, never liked to ask a question on other expense, but did hit you guys by $0.02 this quarter. Is that a level that we should be thinking about on a quarterly basis the next couple?", "William R. Jellison", "No. I think that as we've kind of looked through the back end of the year, we're obviously still getting hit by some of the lower interest rate, especially on the investment incomes, and we're still obviously sitting with a fairly significant amount of cash. But I think that from a year-over-year comparison level, I think the back half is probably not going to have as negative of an impact as you saw in the second quarter of this period.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Just first, with a competitor signing the Reconstructive joint business to MicroPort, is there any outlook here for Stryker to take advantage of any disruption, sales force attrition, et cetera, to see some benefit there in either hips or knees?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Whenever you have any kind of transition, there's always opportunity. But they had a very, very small share of the overall market. So any gains that we would get, I would say look at all the players likely to be able to capitalize a little bit. But given how small their market share was, it wouldn't be something that would be meaningful to our overall results.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then just a follow-up question on Biologics. Can you just talk about the performance of Stryker's Biologics Unit, future investment, future interest in building out your Biologics franchise? And then any interpretation of the [indiscernible] analysis for Medtronics-infused product and whether or not that's a positive or negative for Stryker's Biologics going forward.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Sure. We've acquired Orthovita, as you know, recently. And we were very pleased with the Vitoss product, which has been sold by our Spine business as well as our Trauma business. Last year, Spine took full advantage of that and really had terrific performance. I would say this year, Trauma has picked it up and Orthovita's starting to have a little bit more of this positive impact in Trauma than it did last year. But we really like that business. It has very good clinical data. And we continue to have runway for growth in Biologics. We have a dedicated business unit which focuses just on R&D and making the product. And then it's sold through our existing sales force. So that was the thesis of the acquisition. We're pleased with that acquisition. But frankly, the BMP issue on Medtronic, that -- their decline has really happened over the last number of quarters. It seems to be starting to level off and maybe there might be a little bit more decline. But whatever benefit has accrued, whether it's to us or other players in the market, it's pretty much behind us. We do also have some Biologics sold by our Sports Medicine and our Foot and Ankle business. We entered into a distribution agreement just recently on that. And that seems to be going very well as well. So whether Biologics will continue to be an area of focus for us in the future. But we have a pretty good portfolio right now that we're looking to maximize.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "The follow-up that I had, sorry about that before, was around medical. And just to maybe probe a little further into that, I know you've gotten a couple of questions on it, the environment being what it is and here you have these pretty impressive numbers in the quarter. Can you maybe talk about the degree to which there was a product cycle involved there? I know you've launched some new things in sort of critical care or emergency and stretchers side, to the extent maybe that surfaces played a role here. Katherine, you referenced hospitals are being more cautious with some deferrable capital expenses. Maybe help us understand which parts of medical are performing so well for you.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. I would just -- I think on the margin, yes, Surfaces helps, on the margin, some new product launches. Like Power-LOAD, which I believe we showed earlier in the year at the academy meeting. But I wouldn't say medical is in the midst of a major new product cycle that's driving the growth. And I probably don't want to get into a whole lot of granularity regarding the business segment growth rate because we don't break that out separately. But in general, as you look at our -- all of our capital businesses, which are around 22% to 23% of total company revenue, my comments earlier was that medical as a group is the most deferrable, in terms of beds and stretchers just having an inherently longer life cycle, versus something like the capital businesses of our endoscopy and instruments business, where cameras and power tools are technically capital, but they're less deferrable than other certain types of businesses, certainly than medical.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. The only thing I'd add is, we really like being in the medical business. It is volatile. So from quarter-to-quarter, we do have to deal with that volatility. But there are new products, whether it's the Power-LOAD -- there's a new wheelchair that they launched recently, which did not contribute in any meaningful way to sales in this quarter, but those types of investment, you'll start to see the benefit over time. So we are committed to innovation in medical. And over the cycle, with the ups and downs, we certainly -- we do expect to be growing at above-market rates and we really do enjoy that business.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So thank you, all, for joining our call. Our conference call for the third quarter 2013 results will be held on October 17, 2013. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC.", "Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations.", "In view of the recently announced definitive agreement to acquire MAKO Surgical, we have also included David Floyd, Group President of Orthopedics. And following my opening comments, David will provide some additional perspectives on this pending transaction. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results, and we will wrap up with Q&A.", "Turning to our Q3 results. Sales, excluding currency and acquisitions, accelerated to 6.1% versus 2012. With the same number of selling days in the quarter, this represents strong organic sales growth with all 3 segments: Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine contributing to the sales momentum. This growth was also balanced geographically, with the U.S. up 6.5% and international increasing 5.5%.", "In the U.S., Reconstructive growth was powered by hip gains of 9.3% and Trauma and Extremities of 22.7%. Trauma and Extremities continues to roll, having now reported 7 quarters in a row of double-digit growth, including a 39% increase in Foot & Ankle this quarter.", "U.S. MedSurg saw a pickup in Endoscopy at 10.5% as OR integration sales improved, but was offset by a decline in Instruments due to the Neptune recall and challenging comps from System 7 sales in 2012. We expect Instruments to return to positive sales growth in the U.S. in Q4.", "U.S. Neurotechnology and Spine was driven by 14% sales growth in Neurotechnology as each of its businesses registered double-digit gains.", "Shifting to our o U.S. sales, for the second consecutive quarter, our European business registered positive year-over-year growth and is growing at market rates. Emerging markets continue to do well, with China, Brazil and India delivering very strong double-digit growth.", "We continue to deliver strong operating cash flow and are up 14.4% year-to-date. Our strong balance sheet has enabled us to pursue an acquisition strategy that is expanding our sales footprint into some of the highest growth and most innovative segments of med tech. With our recently announced agreement to acquire MAKO Surgical, we believe we are well positioned to unlock the long-term potential for robotic-assisted surgery, which will further define Stryker as a leader in orthopaedics.", "We are also able to continue to grow our dividend while periodically executing share buybacks.", "Moving down the P&L. At 68.8%, our adjusted gross margin ramped considerably from the prior year due in part to continued benefits being realized from our previously discussed 5-year plan to drive greater operational efficiencies.", "R&D was up significantly in the quarter at plus 19%, reflecting both timing and continued commitment to investing for the future.", "Our adjusted SG&A percent of sales was slightly lower in the quarter compared to Q3 last year despite costs related to a distributor transition in Asia, which adversely impacted our per share earnings by roughly $0.03 in total.", "On a per share basis, Q3 adjusted EPS was $0.98, reflecting solid organic sales growth and gross margin expansion, partly offset by heightened investments in R&D and one-time SG&A costs. We are narrowing our full year organic sales growth guidance to 4.5% to 5.5%, which once again raises the lower end of the range as we did following Q2 results. We remain comfortable with and confirm our full year adjusted EPS estimates of $4.20 to $4.26.", "Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to make a few comments regarding our recently announced plans to acquire MAKO Surgical. As many of you may recall from our recent analyst meeting, we are disciplined regarding the metrics we use to evaluate our acquisition targets and most of our deals fall within our guidelines as it relates to deal returns. However, occasionally we look to invest in areas that we believe can deliver breakthrough innovation. And these are, by definition, bigger bets with bigger potential rewards. MAKO clearly falls into this category.", "And David will now elaborate more fully on this. David?", "David K. Floyd", "Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon, and I appreciate the opportunity to join today's call and provide you with additional perspective regarding our enthusiasm with the recently announced signing of a definitive agreement to acquire MAKO Surgical.", "I want to begin by describing our view on the future of reconstructive orthopaedic surgery. We firmly believe that innovation will drive growth, and that meaningful differentiation in technology and in business models can drive share gains. The combination of MAKO and Stryker provides an excellent platform for achieving this.", "As for innovation, we believe that the key opportunities in joint reconstruction are procedural advancements, significantly improved patient experience as documented in outcomes and a new generation of implants. Robotics, and specifically the MAKO platform, is uniquely able to deliver in all 3 areas.", "Procedural innovation must address 3 key factors. First, the ability of an implant system to enable consistently reproducible superior outcomes in a variety of surgical settings in varying levels of surgical team skill and experience. We think the keys here are bone preparation, implant placement and joint alignment and balancing. This is the most obvious demonstrated capability of robotics in orthopaedic surgery and a key driver of the near-term value proposition.", "Second, advancing procedural efficiency must involve minimizing soft tissue disruption and other factors that increase postoperative pain and complications.", "Third, significantly improving overall procedure flow and process efficiency will be essential. However, simply making the surgery faster without making it better has limited value over the long term. MAKO has demonstrated that robotics can deliver on many of these factors of procedural innovation, and shows promise on delivering on all of them as the technology platform advances.", "Turning to the other opportunities for innovation. These 3 elements of procedural advancement are designed to address not only the needs of the surgeon and the health care system, but we believe will deliver enhanced patient experience and outcomes, especially in knee replacement surgery. MAKO is already demonstrating very encouraging results in unicompartmental knee surgery, and we are convinced that similar advances can be achieved in total joint replacement.", "Finally, we are convinced that long term clinical results can be further enhanced by the next generation of implants. The combination of consistently reproducible precision in bone preparation offered uniquely by robotics, coupled with new implant designs that take advantage of robotics as an enabler, will lead to a significant step forward in improved patient outcomes, especially for the increasingly younger patients that seek joint replacement surgery. Such implants are clearly years from commercialization but are a meaningful factor in the long-term value of this platform.", "As many of you know, I've been involved in the orthopaedic market for over 2 decades and during that time have seen a variety of innovations in joint replacement surgery. And while I am very proud of what we have achieved in partnership with surgeons to innovate in ways that have significantly improved patient outcomes, the long-term potential offered by robotic-assisted surgery holds the promise of transforming reconstructive surgery.", "As the pioneer in this field, MAKO has demonstrated extraordinary and rapid success in a business that has classically relied on incremental changes.", "We believe Stryker's long history in joint reconstruction, capital equipment and surgical instruments, along with synergistic engineering resources focused on robotics, will help further advance this platform and its commercial success.", "Our Reconstructive implants have a strong reputation with surgeons and highly successful clinical outcomes. Additionally, we have a long history in selling capital to hospitals, and we understand the unique aspects of the sales model.", "Combined, this should help ensure we can both expand penetration for robotic-assisted surgery in joint reconstruction, while also continuing to leverage our know-how and MAKO's R&D pipeline to help unlock the longer-term potential in the broader orthopaedics market.", "I look forward to taking additional questions at the end of today's call and will now turn it over to Bill to discuss our Q3 financials in more detail.", "William R. Jellison", "Great. Thanks, David. Sales growth was positive by 4.8% in the quarter, including a negative 2% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was a positive 6.8%, which includes organic growth of 6.1%. There is virtually no difference in selling days for the quarter.", "EPS on a GAAP basis for the quarter ended at $0.27 per share versus $0.92 per share last year in the third quarter, while adjusted earnings per share was $0.98 for the quarter versus $0.97 per share for the third quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of approximately $0.05 per share from FX and $0.03 per share from the med tech tax.", "The income statement is exposed to both transactional and translational FX risks, while the balance sheet is just exposed to translational FX risk. In the past, we have only hedged transactions once they have occurred. However, in October, we have begun to establish a layered transactional hedging program, which will help us mitigate some of the transactional volatility caused by changes in FX rates. This program will start to have some effect in the first quarter of 2014 and will be more fully in place by the end of next year. We are also implementing a net investment hedging program this month, primarily structured to mitigate some of the translational risk associated with our more liquid assets that are held in euros.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustment in the quarter are primarily related to a $213 million (sic) [$313 million] increase in the charge associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune. These charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts and assumptions become more refined. No potential insurance proceeds, proceeds that may be available to cover some of this potential cost, have been included at this time.", "While looking at sales in the quarter, our organic growth of 6.1% was comprised of a positive 7.1% from volume and mix, with price negatively impacting it by 0.9%. Acquisitions added 0.7%, while FX had a negative 2% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year.", "Looking at our segments. Reconstructive represented 44% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Reconstructive products were up 6.5% as reported and grew 9.2% constant currency. U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 9.9% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S., with sales increasing 22.7%, led by new products, sales execution and strong growth in Foot & Ankle.", "U.S. hips and knees had strong growth in the period of approximately 9% and 4% in the quarter, respectively, recognizing that hips benefited in part from easier year-over-year comparisons. Knees continue to feel the impact from the absence of our ShapeMatch Cutting Guides, but the growth in this category still appears to be in line with the market.", "Our international Reconstructive business was up 8.2% in constant currency and had organic growth of 5.3%. All major regions posted positive gains. However, knee growth internationally was negatively impacted this quarter by a distributor transition in Asia affecting some smaller countries in the region. Outside of Asia, we achieved positive year-over-year gains in all regions.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 37% of sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 1.5% as reported and 2.6% on a constant currency basis. These results were led by high-single-digit growth from our Endoscopy and Sustainability Solutions businesses. Medical had slightly positive growth, while Instruments declined in the period. Instrument sales growth in the U.S. were hindered by both the strong System 7 sales in the third quarter last year and having the Neptune Waste Management System out of the market this year. However, in the fourth quarter, the Neptune lost sales will be reflected in both periods. We look forward to getting this product obviously back on the market once we obtain regulatory clearance.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine represented 19% of company sales and delivered another strong quarter. Sales increased 7.7% as reported and 10% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this segment was led by IVS and our Neurotechnology businesses, where all of these businesses posted solid double-digit constant currency growth.", "Spinal implant sales were up slightly in the U.S. and up double-digit internationally on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of Trauson, international Spine implants still posted growth in the mid-single digits.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2013 were 68.8% compared to 68.2% in the same period last year. The rate was positively impacted by improved operating cost, efficiencies and overhead absorption as inventory levels increased in the quarter. Product mix was also favorable as Recon sales were very strong in the period and MedSurg sales experienced more moderate growth. FX and price had a negative impact on the rate this quarter. However, the impact on the gross margin rate was less than in the first half of the year. The med tech tax also negatively impacted gross margins by approximately 90 basis points in the quarter.", "As we look at the fourth quarter, we expect our gross margin rates to run lower than the fourth quarter of last year as we continue to be negatively impacted by the med tech tax, and we also expect operational improvements to be dampened in the period as we bring down inventory levels and achieve less overhead absorption in that period.", "Research and development expenses increased by 70 basis points to 6.3% versus 5.6% last year in the quarter. The 19% increase in R&D spending over last year reinforces our commitment to invest in areas where we believe will help us achieve above market sales growth in each of our key product categories.", "Our R&D spending this quarter resulted in an overall higher level of operating expenses in the quarter. However, we believe our total operating expenses will be lower as a percentage of sales in the fourth quarter compared to both the third quarter and last year's fourth quarter, despite our additional investments in R&D.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 52.8% of sales in the third quarter. However, this included approximately $313 million of costs related to the Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune recall. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $818 million or 38% of sales in the third quarter of 2013 versus 38.2% in the prior year's third quarter. SG&A included charges taken in various countries in Asia to transition away from a key distributor in that region, which negatively impacted these expenses by approximately 0.5 percentage point this quarter.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 22.8% in the third quarter, slightly lower than last year in the same period. The rate was negatively impacted by the med tech tax, lower prices and higher R&D spending. However, those impacts were nearly offset this quarter by operational benefits and favorable product mix.", "Other expenses in the third quarter were $13 million compared to $6.4 million last year in the third quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from lower interest income due to lower interest rates and slightly higher interest expense from our increased borrowings.", "Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 24.8%, while the adjusted effective tax rate was 22% for the third quarter, which is consistent with our year-end expectations. This compares to a 20.2% adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter of last year.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, which is an increase of $853 million compared to year end 2012. We also have $2.8 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet.", "From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 57, which are 2 days better than they were last year in September. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 185, which was an increase of 19 days sequentially and 2 days when measured against the prior year quarter. Inventory levels were built in the quarter. However, we do expect to reduce those levels in the fourth quarter and still show a year-over-year improvement of a few days at year end.", "Turning to our cash flow. We had a strong cash generation in the first 9 months of the year, with cash from operations of $1.214 billion compared to $1.061 billion in the prior year. That's an increase of 14.4% over the first 9 months of last year.", "Share repurchases were -- in the first 9 months of 2013 were approximately $252 million during that period, and we still have nearly $750 million available for repurchase under our current authorization.", "Based on our solid sales achievement in the first 9 months of the year and the current economic and market conditions, we are projecting organic growth, or constant currency growth x acquisitions, in a range of 4.5% to 5.5% for the year. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% to 2% in both the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2013.", "As Kevin indicated previously, we are maintaining our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share in 2013 of $4.20 to $4.26.", "Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any of your questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wonder if you could spend a little bit more time on the MAKO transaction. I know you guys gave some color on just the impact from a financial standpoint for the next year, just thinking forward. Can you maybe just go over what you guys are thinking in terms of sales synergies and cost synergies related to the transaction?", "David K. Floyd", "In terms of sales synergies and cost synergies, I think this is really a sales synergy driven value proposition. When we take a look at our implants and the long clinical successful history of our implants, combined with what MAKO has demonstrated in terms of robotics and the ability to precisely position those implants, I think combining those 2 gives us significant revenue synergies over time.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, Kristen, at this point also we -- we've obviously announced the signing, but we haven't yet closed. And so we really don't want to get into too many more descriptions of detailed synergies. That's something that we'll be able to share much more after we close the transaction.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, can you just speak maybe a little bit more on the -- just overall orthopaedic landscape, specifically to hips and knees, and whether or not you think you're seeing a strengthening of the market as we enter into the tail end of the year? And maybe just give an update too on the performance within Europe.", "David K. Floyd", "In terms of the market, particularly as we see in the United States, the third quarter does show some promise, particularly in knees. The knee volume seems to be improving. Ours certainly has. And as we watch the market, we think the knee volume has improved substantially in the third quarter over the first half of the year. And we're optimistic that we'll see some continued modest improvement in the knee volume over the fourth quarter. Hip volume has been reasonably strong over the course of the year.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Kristen, just one comment on the seasonality in the fourth quarter. You know that over the last few years, we have seen this trend with incrementally a little bit more seasonality in Q4 and the offset in the first quarter. Whether or not that happens in this fourth quarter, and especially in front of ACA next year, is a little bit of a guessing game. But overall, the market appears to be stable to incrementally more positive.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And Kristen, this is Kevin. Related to your question around Europe, we're really pleased. This is the second quarter in a row, where we've had positive growth. And frankly, every country improved in the third quarter. Even Italy, which is the one country I've highlighted before, which has been the most challenging. It just had a very, very modest decline year-over-year. So even that has improved in its trend. So we really believe that the changes that we started to make, going back over a year from now, are really taking hold. And that's why we can now confirm that we are growing at market rates, which is clearly ahead of the goal that we have set a year ago.", "Operator", "Our next question is Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities.", "David L. Turkaly - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division", "Given that we just came out of NASS, I was wondering if I could hit you with a couple of quick Spine ones. First off, could you remind us what your MIS or minimally invasive strategy is there? And then the nice growth that you saw, do you think you'd attribute that to the turmoil from some of the big deals in this space? Or are we seeing procedures pick up?", "David K. Floyd", "Yes, this is David. In terms of our MIS strategy, we just launched this year the second generation of our percutaneous pedicle screw system, the ES2. And that has been a very strong growth driver for us. In addition, differentiated interbody technology. So that's been our approach on MIS. And we have been able to see better pricing and stronger growth in MIS. In terms of whether the overall procedure volume is improving, I think it's been pretty consistent in third quarter in line with the year. And I think that's -- what we've seen in Spine is that differentiated technologies can drive growth.", "Operator", "Our next question is Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "While we've got you here, Kevin and both David, maybe just spend some more time on MAKO. I think people are probably a bit surprised in the proxy to see that it was a one-on-one conversation, Kevin, between you and MAKO and that there weren't other parties involved. So can you talk a little bit about, a, how you came about the valuation for MAKO? And b, how people should think about a return on the investment given the purchase price?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So MAKO has clearly been on our radar screen for some time. And we believe in the power of robotics. It's something that, I think, we've shared pretty openly with the analysts that we believe in the potential. So yes, the proxy MAKO just issued -- their preliminary proxy for those of you that are wondering what Mike's asking about. And in that proxy statement, you can see the cascade of events, which started with me approaching their CEO in early August. And we obviously moved fairly quickly through the process to actually consummate a signing of a deal. And for us, we really see this, as David earlier indicated, as a potential game changer in reconstructive surgery, not just for their uni application, but clearly beyond that. And I think David outlined all of that rationale. So for us, as you read that time line, you'll understand that we had a chance to go in and do our due diligence. And we feel that this is going to be a good deal for Stryker over the long term. Clearly, the price represents a premium, but we feel that over the long term, this will deliver very strong returns for Stryker. It will differentiate us in the marketplace and will really unlock the potential. And as you know, in many procedures, the satisfaction level isn't quite as high as we would like it to be. We believe robotics will be a key enabler to be able to meet that need.", "Michael N. Weinstein - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Just one follow-up then. Can you maybe shed some light on the pipeline of the products coming out of MAKO, particularly from the -- that they just bought the Pipeline piece of the story? So can you just talk a little bit about what might be in Pipeline's pipeline if you follow that. And then just -- maybe just another one, just could you spend another minute on the distributor transition in Asia because obviously that impacted the business this quarter.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So obviously, when we signed with MAKO, we were very well aware of the Pipeline transaction. It was well in process. And at this point, I really don't want to get into a lot of details. Again, between signing and closing, I would rather just let you know that we feel very good about -- of that acquisition. We believe that, that complements MAKO very well and will be a complement to Stryker. And I'll just leave it at that for now. Related to distributor transition, so small market countries in Asia, where this happens in our company from time to time, where we have to go through these transitions. And it's unfortunate, but we're actually changing out a distributor in some small market countries. So obviously, it does not affect China, it does not affect India, but some small market countries in Asia. And as a result of that transition, we've had to take some charges in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So just to start, I have a follow-up on the hip and knee markets, and I appreciate your comments. But I was just wondering if you could share any anecdotes you're hearing from the field in terms of what's driving the incremental improvement in the market. And I know there's some easy comps here, but clearly things feel a little better. So any anecdotes from the field or any sense from you guys as to what the drivers are of this improvement in hip and knee volumes?", "David K. Floyd", "This is David. I've been watching this for a long time, and it can be hard to explain. It seems like all of a sudden the knee patients stay home. And then all of a sudden, they show back up. But what we've seen, I think, over the last couple of years is a little bit more consistency with hip patients because quite frankly, it's a little bit harder to delay hip replacement surgery just from a lifestyle standpoint. Knee replacement patients do have some options to sort of delay the surgery. They ultimately need to have it. And I think economic insecurity and uncertainty about insurance coverage have kept some patients on the sidelines. It's possible that either they have just gotten to the point where they have to have the surgery or, as they've gotten just a little bit more comfortable with the future, they've come back. But that's -- you asked for anecdotes, and so you got some anecdotes.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, but it's one quarter. So obviously, we tend not to get too discouraged when we have a soft quarter. We tend to not get too encouraged when we have a strong quarter. But we do believe that the market is gradually improving. And it's gradually improving. It's not spiking. But we believe that from what we're hearing that the market is gradually improving.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And then one follow-up on MAKO. As you kind of did your return calculations, can you give us a sense over time as to how much market share you need -- you think you need to take in order to get this to be a positive return? I'm just kind of curious as to some of your assumptions there. And then I was also wondering if you could describe what kind of happened to your own internal program and what caused you to kind of shift from an internal focused program to going out and buying MAKO?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Bob, I'll take the second part of the question. And as it relates to the area, we've long talked about having a significant interest in robotic-assisted surgery in any type of technology, whether it's cutting guides, navigation, where we play roles in both those markets that kind of assist the surgery. And we used the learnings and our understanding of that market and looked at the MAKO technology and really believe the value proposition, by combining the 2, was going to really allow for differentiation in the market. And as David alluded to, market share gains that are not within the norm that we traditionally see. Or put another way, we're looking for, over time, meaningful share gains. That was really how we thought about it as it related to our own internal analysis of the robotic space.", "William R. Jellison", "And also maybe just a follow-on comment on that, Bob, as well. From an assumption perspective, obviously, we have a number of different assumptions that are included in the broader-based model. We're comfortable with those. We're comfortable with the levels that they're delivering on from an overall discounted cash flow analysis for us. The immediate first or first few year returns are obviously lower for this type of business because it's at a very early stage. But we think that this is a game changer within this category for us, and we think it's a great fit in our broader-based portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question is Matthew Dodds with Citicorp.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, Kevin, Neurotechnology, that business also did really well. What's your take on how the market's doing there? I assume you're gaining share, but what's your view on the overall market?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Maybe I'll just jump in there. We are really pleased with the performance within our Neurotechnology group. And clearly, Neurovascular is continuing to see very strong momentum. A lot of that is what they've been able to do in the coiling market, which is about 40% of that segment. We've launched a number of new products there, standard, long, nano-sized coils. And we're now just in the process of launching the Target XL. And that's a fatter, larger diameter coil. And we've been seeing nice pull-through from that as well. We've had a number of other product launches within that segment. So that's really been the biggest driver of the performance overall in that space.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then one quick follow-up. On Trauson, how has that gone? I know you gave a little bit of a breakout of that growth in acquisitions. How has it gone now, a couple of quarters in?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So far, so good is what I'd say, Matt. The Trauson momentum is really consistent with our plans and our acquisition model. So we're really pleased. In China, we have maintained the sales momentum that had existed prior to the acquisition. We still have work to do in terms of getting Trauson sold outside of China. And I'd say, we knew that, that was going to take us a bit of time because we had a lot of product registration issues, and we have to get the distribution channel sorted out. So that's going to take a little longer. But certainly within China, we're very pleased with the momentum. And by all accounts, whether it's R&D, whether it's the distributor channel, whether it's customer sales and market share, by every measure, we're sort of on track right now.", "Operator", "Your next question is Jason Wittes with Brean Capital.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. One, if I could just push a little bit more on the hip and knee market, is it possible to break out how much of the growth came from revisions versus primaries in both hips and knees?", "David K. Floyd", "I think it's fair to say that our revision growth is higher, substantially higher than the primary growth rate just because of the nature of the procedures.", "Jason Wittes - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Okay. But I mean, is that -- if you look at where the growth's coming from, are you saying it's equally distributed or it's coming a little bit more from the revision side than the primary side? I guess that's what I was trying to ask.", "David K. Floyd", "The growth is across both. So we have good, strong, healthy growth in both our primary and our revision platforms. The growth rates are typically higher on the revision side, but we had strong growth across both.", "Operator", "Our next question is Derrick Sung with Sanford C. Bernstein.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Kevin, we heard earlier this week from Synthes that they in their trauma business were seeing some pressure from low-cost or value-oriented competitors here in the U.S. And obviously, your business in trauma is doing quite differently here. You're doing very well. But I wanted to get your perspectives on what you're seeing in terms of these sort of low-cost generic orthopaedic manufacturers in the U.S.? Do you think it's a long-term threat? Is it an opportunity for you? And might this spread to other areas like hips and knees or in spine?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So I'll start the answer and then I'll pass it to David. What I can tell you is, we have not really seen any of this. And we did see the comment made. And quite frankly, we're puzzled by it. It really has not affected us. As you see, our double-digit growth has been very consistent, very steady. And obviously, a spectacular quarter this year in Trauma and Extremities. So if it was something meaningful, I think we would have noticed it. It would've affected our growth rate. So thus far, we're not seeing it. But maybe David, if you want to add something.", "David K. Floyd", "Yes. I think what we see from our customers is they continue to put a great value on differentiated technology, on better instruments and on high service levels. So we quite frankly just don't see much of an opportunity to go in with some sort of low-cost generic model in trauma. We occasionally see things in ambulatory surgery centers for simple wrist fractures. But by and large, in the Level 1 trauma centers and even in the community hospitals, the full product line and high service continue to be very, very important.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. I have a follow-up, just going back to MAKO, as a company you have a lot of experience in selling capital equipment. And I was just wondering if you could kind of give us a little bit more color on kind of what gives you the confidence that the market for hospital capital spending, that hospitals will continue to be able to spend the level that is needed for a MAKOplasty type piece of equipment, either today or moving forward. Why do you think that market can still grow? And just maybe some of your thoughts there on capital spending as it relates to MAKO.", "David K. Floyd", "Sure. I'd be happy to. I think it's helpful to sort of break it out into the near term, the next few years, the longer term and the future. In the near term, you have to appreciate that for most hospitals, if not nearly all hospitals, the orthopaedic service line is one of their premier profit centers. Joint replacement surgery is a highly profitable procedure and a great growth driver for the hospitals. And what MAKO has successfully done is demonstrate that with a robotic program, hospitals that have a robot and a strong robotic program have driven substantially increased patient volume and substantially improved payer mix. So those hospitals in our survey work, as we studied this, indicated that hospitals that acquired a robot and drove a strong program were very, very happy with the results and definitely felt like the capital expense was well worth it. Over the long term, however, I think what will be necessary to improve the value proposition, particularly as the way health care is paid for changes, are demonstrated superior patient outcomes in ways that not only give the patient better clinical outcomes, but superior economic outcomes. And we're confident based on the trends of the early data, as well as the promise of the platform as it develops, that robotics will deliver on both of those over the long term.", "Operator", "Our next question is Raj Denhoy with Jefferies & Company.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I wonder if I could just ask about the Foot & Ankle performance you noted in the quarter. I think you mentioned it was 39% growth. I think that business is probably trending well above $100 million for you now. And I'm curious if you could just offer anything in terms of what's driving that growth. Is it still the underlying market is supporting that kind of growth? Or do you think that there's a share capture story happening here?", "David K. Floyd", "I think it's both. We do believe we're capturing some meaningful share. We also think the market is growing at a very healthy rate. This is a market that is very difficult to sort of figure out exactly how much the market is growing. It's not like major joint reconstruction where you can calibrate it pretty tightly based on reported results. But we think there's strong growth. I think the -- there's strong procedure growth. And also as we introduce new products and new technologies that yield better results, we see surgeons doing procedures that yield higher implant ASPs than the lower implant ASPs of yesterday's technology. But we do also believe we've been able to capture some share.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would just make one cautionary comment though. As you start to think about Q4, just be aware of the magnitude of the year-over-year comparisons that we'll be going up against into the fourth quarter, which obviously are going to temper the growth rates from a percentage basis.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "That said, we still feel very bullish. This is a market that has tremendous room to expand. And obviously, the decision to create a separate business unit at the beginning of last year and dedicate sales force specifically for the podiatric surgeon is bearing fruit. And we're seeing tremendous growth with that dedicated sales force with a new call point that we frankly hadn't called on in the past.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. That's fair. Maybe I could just ask one about Neptune. I think you noted that next quarter will be the first quarter you won't be comping against it. And I'm curious if you could just remind us of what magnitude or how big that has been -- how big of a drag that has been for the last couple of quarters -- the last 4 quarters for you?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. I mean, in the first half of the year, it was probably averaging somewhere in the $15 million to $20 million a quarter range. And in the third quarter, because again, at least the month of September had a year-over-year equal comparison, it was really July and August. There's probably only about $7 million impact in comparison for the third Q. So as we move forward into the fourth quarter, that will be obviously out of both periods.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Glenn Novarro's line with RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Two questions. One on price. I noticed price was down 0.9% here in 3Q and in 2Q it was down 1.5%, so less pricing pressure. Was there anything specific that led to slightly less pricing pressure or is that just part of the fluctuations that you'll see during the course of the year? And then second, some of my companies are starting to go to cash EPS after they do some big dilutive transactions. Have you thought about going to cash EPS for 2014 and beyond?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. So 2 questions there, both on the price and the cash EPS. From a price perspective, obviously, that can move between different quarterly periods with a strong -- especially strong sales in comparison to the prior period. I think that there's obviously less impacts associated with what's going through in any one specific quarter. I think the price increase -- or the price -- negative price impacts of between kind of 1% and 1.5% or 1% and 2% range I think is pretty consistent. And I think that, that's what we would expect moving forward. As far as cash EPS is concerned, obviously, anytime we would do an acquisition, we would take a look at both ends of it. I think as we complete the acquisition, we'll talk more specifically about kind of what we're planning on doing there. But it's at least something that we'll consider at the point in time that we close the transaction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "David, in your prepared remarks, you referenced the need for both business model and product innovation. I know you've talked a little bit about the MAKO opportunity and also how the hospital landscape is changing. But maybe if you go into a little bit more specifics about what you envision business model change to actually mean? And I know, Kevin, that's been an area of focus for you in talking with investors about the evolving needs of orthopaedics. So maybe you just -- I think we understand what the hospital looks like, maybe you'd give us some perspective as to where you're going with your strategy?", "David K. Floyd", "Well, I think -- so first of all, I spoke of business model differentiation as opposed to business model change. One of the things we find very attractive about MAKO's business model is they sell capital equipment in order to sell implants. And that's very different than sort of the standard business model in reconstructive implants, where companies provide capital free of charge in order to sell implants. So that's -- that shows a unique model. And I think that's an example of a different kind of business model that can help drive value, growth and share gain over time.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Maybe just a follow-up on emerging markets. You obviously spoke a little bit about Trauson, and that's obviously a big focus for you in those geographies. And maybe if you could just speak a little more generically about the performance of emerging markets and whether we're at a point where Trauson has become additive to your overall growth? How you sort of see your portfolio emerging in those geographies and any thought on what the sustainable growth profile might be?", "William R. Jellison", "I'll answer that. Just from an overall perspective. Trauson obviously is a key acquisition for us in that region. We would expect that business to put forth some very solid growth performance. The numbers that we broadly talked about as far as how well the emerging markets are doing, those are all doing very well for us in the double-digit range. Obviously, even excluding Trauson, and Trauson continues to deliver right based on our overall expectations for that business. So we would expect it in the future to continue to help stimulate our broader-based emerging market growth, but we would also expect our base business to continue to put forth some very good numbers in those regions, too.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. What I'd say in emerging markets is, just repeat what I've said in the past. And this is Kevin speaking. That at 6% of sales at the end of 2012, that was our representation of emerging markets. And clearly, we have an ambition to move that number much higher to get into the low-teens over time. And we expect Trauson to be one of the ways we're going to get there, but also growing in the premium segment very rapidly in China, in Brazil, in India. And Russia and Turkey are 2 other priority markets where our presence today is a very small. They're markets that we frankly exited a number of years ago. And we have clear plans to get back into those markets. And in the quarters ahead, we'll have more to share in our progress in those markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Kevin, just a quick one for you and maybe a follow-up for David. But speaking to trauma specifically, I know you regarded -- you talked about the low price competition. But just your business momentum, I think we started several quarters talking about perhaps this was the result of competitor recalls, but you're clearly past that now. And I wonder, what do you think is driving the business here? Is it breadth of product? Is it specific distributor wins? Is it a change in your selling model? Because all we've seen is multi-quarter acceleration. So what specifically is driving this improvement and how sustainable do you see it?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So this is the kind of question I'm sure David would love to answer, but I'll take a little bit of the beginning part of the question and then I will turn it to David. I mean, it's been a great story without a doubt. Frankly, it's been a multiyear process, which starts with the pipeline. So we've really completely blown out our R&D capabilities and launched a number of products that now have a broad product portfolio that can compete with Synthes, which frankly was -- none of the other players were able to do that, including Stryker, 5 years ago. So building out the product bag was a huge part of it. And frankly, our sales force execution has been just outstanding. And we have a combined sort of direct. We have dedicated reps. In some cases, we have combined reps. And under common management, we've just driven tremendous performance with outstanding execution in the field. So maybe I'll turn it to David for other color commentary.", "David K. Floyd", "Yes, Kevin, I think that's right. If you could summarize why we've been successful in trauma, I think it's consistent focus. This is not a business that we get excited about and then cut back and get excited about and cut back. We've had consistent focus on trauma year-over-year with a long-term plan to meaningfully build a strength in this segment. I would say the 3 key components are, as Kevin said, the product line. We have a fantastic full and complete product portfolio that continues to expand and grow and develop. Our specialized sales model, where we have increasingly trauma sales reps calling on these as opposed to full-line [ph] sales reps, particularly in the major metro area. And finally, our integrated field sales management approach. So even though we have dedicated trauma reps and dedicated trauma sales managers, our brand -- general managers are responsible for growth and bringing united fronts. So I think that focus, that product line and our sales model are delivering extraordinary results.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And then David, maybe sticking with you. Maybe 2 questions related to MAKO. The first is, what is -- or how does an Otis strategy progress in a post-MAKO world? That's sort of Part 1. And then Part 2 is, I doubt we're going to get you to give us time lines on product approvals, so I won't go there. But can you give us any sense of what level of clinical work you think is going to be required to bring Stryker implants up on the MAKO system?", "David K. Floyd", "Yes, so in terms of our ShapeMatch product line, we still think that is a very strong and healthy business segment. We look forward to getting that product back on the market. It's different than robotics. And quite frankly, there won't be a robot in every hospital in the near future. It will take some time to penetrate that market. And we think there's a great opportunity for ShapeMatch as there is a continuing opportunity for our Navigation product as well. There's, I think, a good appetite for a variety of approaches for how to use computer-assisted surgical techniques in one shape or another to deliver improved patient outcomes. We think the time frame in terms of transitioning Stryker products over to the RIO platform is probably about 1 year or 2 when you consider the engineering work, development work on the robotics side and the regulatory time frame. But we'll have probably more clarity about that in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Michael Matson with Needham & Company.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "We've heard from Biomet that they're planning to launch a bi-cruciate sparing knee. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that potential opportunity. Maybe this fits into the reasons that you bought MAKO. But just do you see this as a viable product category?", "David K. Floyd", "Sure. Today, the benefit of a bi-cruciate retaining knee is quite frankly based on a theory. And there's some intuitive appeal to this theory. That preserving that ACL will significantly improve patient satisfaction. However, I would point out there's nothing like a broad consensus on this. And as you look at the procedure, there's significant surgical complexity. To date, in our view, it's a highly technique-dependent procedure. We are committed to evaluate technologies, which includes implants, instruments, procedural modifications and potentially robotics to enable new procedures, which could over time include bi-cruciate retaining knees.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then given the high level of R&D spending, I understand there were some timing issues. But what do you -- Kevin, what do you sort of feel is the right level of R&D spending as a percent of sales? Is it going to stick around the 5.5% level or could we see it creeping up towards 6% over the longer term?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So clearly, you saw the Neurotechnology business growing very, very rapidly, and they are larger consumers of R&D dollars. So our guidelines right now are in the 5.5% to 6% range. Obviously, this quarter we were a little higher than that. But I think that's a good operating assumption is we'll be in the 5.5% to 6% on an ongoing basis.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So just wanted to explore 2 things here. One is, if you could help us understand the timing of the MAKO transaction. I know that you approached this summer but you've been talking about it for a while. So I'm just curious if there was something you saw on the data or something that made this really the right time for you to approach them and do the deal.", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think with any transaction, there's always different events that lead to when you eventually pull the trigger. We've long had a interest in robotics, as Kevin spoke to on the call. Felt the time was right to approach them. Went through our normal due diligence, and that resulted in us announcing the transaction.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "And then for the last few quarters, you talked about trying to get back to your prior growth rates in Europe in Recon. Just curious for an update there on how the reorganization is going and how the results were in Europe?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "I think as you all know, the implant percent of sales is much higher in Europe than it is in the United States. So this turnaround has been really been an implant story for the most part. And as I mentioned, this is the second consecutive quarter of positive growth. And it's taken a bit of time. But certainly, in certain countries, we were -- like the U.K. and France, we were well ahead. Other countries, like Germany and Spain, it\u2019s taken a little longer, but we're now running very, very well. We've had some good conversions. We've won some tenders. So that business has really turned. And in Italy, we've had a number of problems over the last few years, and we are starting to -- that's starting to bottom out. So I would say that the turnaround has been largely an implant turnaround. And we're very pleased with our performance. That's now growing at market rates.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "One for Bill and then one for Kevin. So Bill, I may be reading too much into this, but the full year guidance implies about 3% to 6% constant currency growth in the fourth quarter, if my math is correct. Any reason to expect a deceleration in Q4? And then I just have one follow-up for Kevin after that.", "William R. Jellison", "No. I'd say -- I mean, our year-to-date constant -- our year-to-date overall organic growth, and it's the organic growth that we're talking about, not constant currency in our guidance. So the organic growth that we're looking at is pretty consistent with how we've run on a year-to-date basis, and we're expecting it to still be in that similar range.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then Kevin, it would be helpful to hear from you how you're thinking about M&A moving forward. Should we expect kind of a pause now as you digest the MAKO deal?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So as I think we've mentioned in the past, every one of our businesses are constantly scanning for acquisitions. We have a very, very strong balance sheet. So even after the MAKO transaction closes, we're still in a very, very strong financial position. So I would not assume that we are slowing down at all. I think another deal of this size may not happen in the next month or 2. And that's not typical of us, that deals of this size -- this is obviously larger than a typical deal, but I would be surprised if we didn't do another deal or 2 or 3 over the next 6 months. You should assume that we're still in the normal deal rhythm.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Swann.", "Ravi Misra - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "This is Ravi in for Rich. Just most of my questions have been answered. Just a little bit more curious about any MAKO strategy in terms of o U.S. rollout, how that might or might not change in Stryker's hands?", "David K. Floyd", "I would say that it's probably fair to assume that there will be some meaningful synergies over time. MAKO has been very -- you see from their results, very U.S. focused. They do have some independent distributors o U.S. And that's something that we'll be taking a look at.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bruce Nudell with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "As part of our diligence, we were calling around. And one of the first guys we ran into doubled his procedure volume, drove his hospital profitable with MAKO, bought a second machine and is a regional center of excellence for partials. And my question is, is just, are there any low-hanging fruit in terms of underused procedures that we should be thinking about that could really drive share gains over the coming 3 to 4 years?", "David K. Floyd", "I'm not sure what you mean by underused procedures. I think one of the things that we see as an opportunity for growth as we did our research on surgeon's interest in robotics, one of the things that had -- that quite frankly made them hesitant and one of the most significant things that made them hesitant was, they were reluctant to move away from implants with a long term clinical history and a company that had been around for a long time. So we think Stryker and MAKO together help address that very effectively.", "Bruce M. Nudell - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And I guess my follow-up, based on the strength that seems to be occurring in the U.S. market today, is we've been assuming around a 4% trend line in units as kind of the natural U.S. trend line. Should we be rethinking that in any way? I know one quarter does not a trend make. But secularly, where do you see the volume trends in the U.S. market?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, Bruce, I think it'd probably be premature to be getting ahead and try to tweak the models to that level of specificity. I think we feel pretty good, as David had alluded to on the call, about the recon market showing signs of stability to modest improvements. Now whether that ends up being 3%, 4%, 5% unit growth, it's a little difficult to thread the needle that closely. But we feel good about the market, our position in it and the outlook. But overall, I don't think it's one where we're going to say, it's time to revise upward in any kind of meaningful way. At the risk of sounding like Debbie Downer, I just want to emphasize that we feel good, but it's not some major inflection point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Brien from William Blair.", "Kaila Krum", "This is Kaila in for Matt. Just another follow-up on the MAKO deal. And I understand you guys don't want to go into too much depth. But we noticed that the first offer price was $21 per share and the deal obviously closed at $30. So that assigns roughly an incremental $500 million in valuation. We're just curious as to what changed your view through that process? What sort of new product applications maybe came to mind that might validate that higher price point?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. I think the way to think about it, as with any deal, as you start out, you have $0.01 valuation, but that's based on limited information. You go in. You do due diligence. You pressure test different assumptions. You look at how you might drive synergies. You look at potential longer term growth values. And all of those ultimately end up in the end valuation, and that's similar to what played out here.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. I wouldn't assume, as happens in other deals, that the first price that we put on the table is the price we were expecting to pay.", "Kaila Krum", "Okay. And then we will expect further, I guess, information then as to those synergies further out. But what sort of value would you assign, I guess, to MAKO's current applications as compared to potential future applications?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. We're probably not going to get into that level of detail. Clearly, we see value in their current indications and our ability, given our broader distribution and marketing capabilities, to drive those penetrations. But as David talked about at length, we also see significant longer-term potential for robotic-assisted surgery in orthopaedic applications, more broadly speaking.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with Oppenheimer & Co.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to ask you about the instrument business in the U.S., obviously a step down. You talked about growth in the fourth quarter, but given that the comparable doesn't ease significantly relative to Neptune, could you talk a little bit more about the dynamics there? What is going on? And what gives you the confidence that you're going to get back to growth in the fourth quarter in the U.S.?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, if you look at the different components of it, the System 7 has a capital component and a disposable component. And the capital component was very significant. We had very significant comps in Q3 of last year. Those comps ease a little bit in Q4. So it's just simple math. If I look at the trends of how the business is performing, and we just do sort of some simple math on year-over-year. Obviously, we don't break out every subcomponent in our disclosures, but it's just doing that math that gives us the confidence. Our underlying business is performing well, and we're optimistic that we'll be able to return to growth.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then Kevin on the knee business, you didn't mention, I don't think today, the DTC. Have you sort of renewed that program? Where are you at in sort of the evaluation there on the knee side? Do you see that program continuing?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So since we have the benefit of David here today, I'll ask David to respond on that.", "David K. Floyd", "Sure. We do plan on continuing that campaign in 2013 and into 2014, but with changes to the media mix as planned last quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can you please remind us of the timing of the return to the market of the Neptune fluid management system as well the cutting blocks? Has there been any change in that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No meaningful change. We're still hopeful sometime possibly this year, end of the year as it relates to Neptune. Obviously, it depends on the government review of the 510(k) and sometime in 2014, the earlier part of 2014 as it relates to the cutting guides.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And I need to throw in a MAKO question here. It strikes me that this would be -- if you call it, the long pole in the tent to a bundling strategy for Orthopaedics. Is that the right way to think about it? And is that part of the thought process in pulling it into your franchise?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, I wouldn't say that that's the primary driver here, but as we -- leveraging our breadth and depth is the Stryker strategy. So obviously, the broader that we get and the fact we're in capital equipment and disposables, we see that as an advantage for Stryker. And obviously, this adds to that. But I wouldn't say that, that is the primary focus at all. I would go back to David's remarks earlier about how this can really transform orthopaedic surgery.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I've been jumping between a couple of calls, so forgive me if I ask questions that have already been asked. But did I hear right, Bill, that there was a $0.02 or $0.03 hit in the quarter from exiting a distributor relationship in Asia? Is that about how you'd quantify it? And were those onetime in nature? Or any color you could give there will be helpful.", "William R. Jellison", "That's correct. It was about a $0.03 impact on the quarter, and it really was pretty much contained just this quarter.", "Jeffrey D. Johnson - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And Kevin, one question I guess for you just on the broader MedSurg platform. As I see NAV3i, that you just launched, looks pretty impressive system. I don't think you've had anything out like this for 6, 7 years, since NAV2 was launched anyway. So wondering, how do I think about the impact that could have on your Instruments business over the next 12 months or so? It just seems like that's a pretty big opportunity that might be flying under the radar screen a little bit.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "We're really excited about this product. And this product, we haven't really sold anything yet. So the sales will start in the fourth quarter. Within our overall Instrument business, obviously, NAV is not the largest portion of that. But we really believe it's a winner, and that should help to contribute to growth over time.", "Operator", "Your next question is a follow-up from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So I had one follow-up on MAKO, sorry, and one more kind of just general strategic question for you, Kevin. I think someone asked a question earlier as to how quickly you might be able to get some of your own implants up and running on the robot. And I just wanted to understand that on the knee side, obviously, there's a bit more engineering and approvals that would have to happen to those implants and my guess would be to optimize them for the robot. But is it fair to say that things could possibly move a little faster on the hip side?", "David K. Floyd", "My comments in terms of moving Stryker implants on the robot, I should have mentioned this, were specific to unicondylar knees and total hips because those are the applications that they have approved today. There is no total knee application today approved for the robot, so I can't give you a time line for migrating Stryker products onto a platform that doesn't exist yet.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Right. Understanding that the hips don't have the sort of physical differences between sort of a robotic implant and a traditionally cut implant. Is it possible potentially to have the hips move a little bit faster, say, than, say, unicondylar knees?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think it's probably premature, Matt, at this point to -- we really tried to capture the ranges by saying post closing. And we're probably looking at 1 year to 2 before we would have our implants, whether it's hips or knees. If one of them is sooner or later in that range, I think we'll have a better sense of that as we get to closing.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And then following the closing, we'll be able to share more of our perspective on that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I guess the first question was just on Spine. I just was hoping to get some insight from you on where we're at with the Special Fraud Alert by the OIG against PODs? Are you seeing any benefit there from your business? Are your hospital customers continuing to sign up with PODs? Or are they leaving PODs? And what is your sense of next time line for the next event by the OIG or the Senate Finance Committee, et cetera?", "David K. Floyd", "Sure. How I would characterize the Special Fraud Alert is that it does seem to have slowed down the growth in PODs. We did see some number of customers issue policies that they would not do business with PODs. But we haven't -- we certainly haven't seen them go away. We have heard of a potential of a lawsuit against the government by PODs, trying to get them to clarify their position on that. So the battle is still going to play out over time.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "All right. And then just on your knee unit, you called out a headwind from the ShapeMatch being off the market. I was just wondering if there was any headwind from 2 competitive launches. I know at your Investor Day you commented that you weren't seeing much at that point. I just wanted to make sure that, that wasn't the case for any -- you've been gaining share in knees over the last number of quarters and it was just ShapeMatch and not competitive pressures.", "David K. Floyd", "Yes. No, I think that's right. We have not really seen any significant headwinds from competitive knee launches. And we didn't really expect to see them. I think over time we have to see that play out over the next few quarters. Those launches are still fairly fresh. We feel very good about our knee growth. I think it's in line with the market. Maybe a bit ahead of the market. We hear noise a bit here and there about trialing of new knees, but it still seems to be minor at this point.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. I'd just like to add a comment that getting back to our kind of our sales force execution, which we don't talk about a lot. But if you look at our performance across hips, knees and trauma and you go back over the last 2 years, we've been pretty consistent across all 3 segments, which is quite unusual. And we haven't really talked a lot about that. And I think if you look at most companies, one part will be going well, the other part will sag. Even if you go back to Stryker's history, in the past, we would sort of really have strong growth in one, in hips, and then it would be softer in knees. And I'm really proud of our team's efforts in driving hips, knees and trauma pretty consistently quarter after quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "You mentioned a couple of points about the Asian distributor switch, but did you quantify how much it impacted your constant currency worldwide growth?", "Katherine A. Owen", "You're talking about the distributor change in Asia?", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Yes, Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "There was a modest top line impact, but not material enough to break it out.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Obviously, it turned our knee performance because the bulk of those sales were knees. Knees are the biggest part of that business. So we've turned our international knee business to slightly negative. If you excluded that, our knee business outside the U.S. grew at roughly the same rate as our knee business inside the United States. But outside of knees, it didn't really have much of an impact. And given the size of Stryker, it's very, very minor to our overall growth.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "But still encouraging. That's a good color. I appreciate that. And you mentioned you're back to E.U. market rates of growth, just thought maybe you'd be kind enough to remind us what that growth rate is? Is it still declining, but now you're declining less or...", "Kevin A. Lobo", "No, no, we're registering positive growth year-over-year. Now I wouldn't say in every country, but in the aggregate. Again, Italy is still slightly negative. But in the third quarter, every other country was positive. In the second quarter, Spain was kind of about flat, and that's turned to positive. But overall, if you look at our overall Europe business in Q2 and in Q3 in constant currency, we had positive growth. Low-single digit, but I believe that the market, based on what we can discern, is roughly growing at low-single digits. So we believe that we are growing at market rates from Q2 to Q3. Last quarter, I didn't want to celebrate too early since it was just one quarter. So I said, let's see if we can do it again in the second quarter -- in the third quarter, which we just did. So now we're feeling confident that we are growing at the market.", "Operator", "We have Matt Miksic with another follow-up from Piper Jaffray.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So the question, Kevin, I wanted to ask you is just around the strategy for robotic surgery and sort of more technology. There's a number of companies investing in more technology for the OR, more technology in acute care. From a distance, I guess the debate has been, gosh, this is an expensive robot and how is that actually fitting the system and how might that take cost out of the system over time in a way that's favorable to the health care system, improve outcomes and so on. I'd love to just get your view on how you think robotic surgery, I would imagine, benefits and transforms this in a way that's cost effective as well as clinically effective.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So I think David touched on some of this. And we don't look at it just buying cool technology. I mean, that's not the way we look at this. We look at this is as really being able to transform orthopaedic surgery. So it can be less invasive to the patient, much more consistent positioning of the implants, more reproducible, more consistent. So you can be running more cases in a day. It can drive better efficiency. It doesn't matter where the procedures are done in the country. Today, we have tremendous variability in procedures and procedure times and the way procedures are done. So we believe that this is an enabler to bring standardization to orthopaedic joint reconstruction. And hospitals are looking for that. Patients are looking for that. And so that's -- we really believe this is a systematic change. And I think David talked a lot about sort of the overall, how profitable this service line is. And we have to demonstrate economic value. And MAKO has shown that. They don't just sell the technology. They're actually selling an economic story. And I think one of our earlier callers commented on how speaking to a surgeon, it's actually driven business for the hospital. So the hospital is concerned with making money, not just driving down costs. So if they get a better payer mix. If they're able to attract more patients. Patients who are on the sidelines who feel confident if they're -- I'm going in for surgery and it's being done with a robotic approach and a Stryker implant, I feel pretty good about the outcome I'm going to get, that will drive more business. And that's what they're concerned about. And we really believe this fits that. We will need to demonstrate over time both clinical and economic evidence. But by no means do we believe this is just a high-priced cool technology. It's much more than that.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Well, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2013 results will be held on January 22, 2014. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations.", "Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide updates as it relates to our recent M&A activity and Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results, as well as provide color on our 2014 guidance, which includes slides available via the webcast. We will then open up the call to Q&A.", "Turning to our Q4 results. Organic sales growth, which excludes currency and acquisitions, was solid again this quarter, increasing roughly 6%. With the same number of selling days in the quarter, this represents strong growth with all 3 segments, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, delivering year-over-year gains. Growth was also balanced geographically, with the U.S. up 7% and international increasing 8% in constant currency.", "U.S. Reconstructive sales were up 9%, reflecting a 10% increase in hips and 8% growth in knees, a stellar performance, particularly given the tough year-over-year comparisons of 7% hip growth and 9% knees growth. And despite also facing challenging prior-year growth of 26%, which benefited from a competitor recall, U.S. Trauma and Extremities was up a very solid 8% this quarter. This business continues its multi-year momentum, and U.S. Foot & Ankle continued to roll, up an impressive 36%.", "U.S. MedSurg was led by Instruments and Endoscopy, which increased 8% and 12%, respectively more than offsetting flat results for medical and a slowdown in Sustainability. Endoscopy's gains reflected across-the-board strength with solid growth in cameras, video and the capital-intensive Communications business, with the latter benefiting in part from easier prior-year comparisons.", "Looking at Instruments, its U.S. performance picked up as signaled on our last call, achieving a strong 8% growth. And with the 510(k) we received late in 2013 for the Neptune Waste Management System as well as the FDA recently lifting its Warning Letter, our Instruments team is well positioned to continue to build on Q4's momentum.", "Additionally, as Katherine will address in more detail, our planned acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies further expands Instruments' growing presence in the operating room, with products targeted at patient and caregiver safety.", "Neurotechnology and Spine was up roughly 5% in the U.S., which was solid performance given the challenging comps. Interventional Spine led the group with strong double-digit sales growth.", "Outside the U.S., Europe continued its momentum, with Q4 sales increasing for the third consecutive quarter, and we continue to see strong gains in emerging markets with very high-double digit growth. International performed well in all areas except knees, which were down 2% in constant currency. This was the result of disruption to our Asia business, which we referenced in our third quarter call.", "We expect our international knee results to return to more normalized growth by the end of Q1 2014. We continue to be pleased by our Trauson results in China and look forward to launching these products in additional countries over the course of 2014. Similar to our performance in the first 9 months, fourth quarter operating cash flow increased roughly 13%, reinforcing the strength of our balance sheet.", "M&A remains a top priority for our cash, and we are excited to have closed the acquisition of MAKO at the end of 2013. We will continue to pursue targeted acquisitions that contribute to our ongoing goal of organic sales growth at the high end of the med tech industry.", "Combined with the December announcement of a 15% increase in our dividend, as well as modest amount of share buybacks in the quarter, we believe our capital allocation strategy will continue to help optimize shareholder returns.", "Moving down the P&L. As expected, our adjusted gross margin declined sequentially, falling to 66.3% given lower overhead absorption in Q4, but came in for the full year with a 30 basis point improvement after adjusting for the medical device tax.", "We continue to make solid investments in R&D, which was up nearly 8% in the quarter, representing 5.6% of total sales.", "On a per share basis, Q4 adjusted EPS was $1.23. And as detailed on Slide 4, on a full year basis, we delivered EPS of $4.23 or at the midpoint of our $4.20 to $4.26 range. This represents a reported year-over-year increase of 4%. However, there were several non-operating items that impacted our EPS in 2013. Adjusting for the negative foreign exchange and the medical device excise tax, as well as the positive benefit from the tax extenders, our underlying EPS growth was approximately 11%, reflecting our commitment to driving leveraged earnings gains.", "We are excited about the breadth of our product portfolio, which spans products and services, as well as implants and capital. Our ongoing investments in R&D, as well as our targeted M&A, positions us well to deliver innovation to our hospital customers. We will continue to focus on our strategy of top line growth, leveraged earnings gains and capital allocation that maximizes the strength of our balance sheet and our healthy cash flow.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today's call will focus on our recent BD activity, providing an update on the acquisition of MAKO Surgical, as well as the announced agreement to acquire Patient Safety Technologies. Both transactions reflect our commitment to deploying our capital to support our M&A strategy, which is primarily focused on our core markets, as well as key adjacent markets.", "With respect to MAKO, we closed this acquisition in late December and believe, long term, it has the potential to transform orthopedic surgery through procedural advancements and improved patient experience and a new generation of implants. The MAKO robotic platform has already proven itself capable of achieving consistently reproducible surgical results.", "As we continue to optimize robotic-assisted surgery, we believe it will further improve clinical outcomes. And longer term, by allowing for bone preparation and geometry and precision not possible with conventional manual instrumentation, there's a potential to develop new implant designs that are specifically enables robotics capability and functionality. In the near term, our teams are focused on leveraging Stryker's considerable sales and distribution capabilities to help drive adoption for MAKO's current applications. Two areas of initial focus, which we are currently evaluating, are enabling Stryker-marketed implants to be put on the robot software and starting the trial for a total knee application. Given the short time since the close, we are not prepared to provide specifics on these 2 items. However, we do anticipate starting the total knee trial in the first half of this year.", "With close to 20% market share in the unicompartmental knee segment. We believe MAKO has demonstrated excellent market acceptance of their partial knee application. However, our analysis suggest there's a bigger opportunity in total hips and total knees to leverage Stryker's reconstructive implants. We look forward to sharing more regarding our plans for robotic-assisted surgery later in 2014. Additionally, our orthopedic growth will be the focus at our September Analyst Meeting Product Fair.", "Shifting to our MedSurg group's BD activities. We recently announced the planned acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies, or PST, for $120 million. PST's innovative and proprietary product portfolio aligns with our Instruments division focused on customer solutions that enhance patient and caregiver safety. Specifically, PST's Safety-Sponge System helps prevent retained foreign objects in the operating room, thereby improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs. The system includes bar-coded surgical sponges and towels and integrated barcode scanner and a unique compliance tracking software. RFOs are the most common surgical never event in the U.S., and sponges are the most common retained object with approximately 2,300 incidents reported annually at an average cost per incident of over $400,000.", "With the SurgiCount Safety-Sponge System, we can provide our customers with a way to eliminate unnecessary cost from the healthcare system, while improving quality of care. Since its launch in 2006, SurgiCount has established a strong customer base of over 300 hospitals, including several of the leading medical institutions in the U.S. The Safety-Sponge System will augment Stryker Instruments' broad portfolio of products that are designed to optimize the perioperative experience by reducing hazards, streamlining operations and improving outcomes for patient and caregivers. Moreover, we believe our sales force can leverage our considerable established base of products, targeted perioperative patient and caregiver safety, including the recently 510-cleared Neptune Waste Management System and the Sterishield Personal Protection System.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "William R. Jellison", "Thanks, Katherine. As Kevin mentioned, we have included a few slides via the webcast, which summarized the 2013 sales and earnings performance and also reflects some additional insights on our 2014 guidance.", "Sales growth was positive by 5.6% in the fourth quarter, including a negative 1.8% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was a positive 7.4%, which includes organic growth of 5.8%. Sales growth for the full year was a positive -- or was positive by 4.2% with organic growth of 5.1%, acquisition growth of 0.8% and a negative 1.6% impact from FX translation.", "Earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter were $1.01 per share versus $0.71 last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.23 for the quarter versus $1.14 in the fourth quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of approximately $0.06 per share from FX and $0.04 per share from the med-tech tax. EPS on a GAAP basis for the full year of 2013 were $2.63 per share versus $3.39 per share last year, while adjusted EPS were $4.23 per share versus $4.07 per share last year. FX negatively impacted the full year results by approximately $0.20 per share, and the med-tech tax had a negative impact of approximately $0.13 per share.", "The income statement is exposed to both transactional and translational FX risks, while the balance sheet is just exposed to translational FX risk. We have begun a layered transactional hedging program, which will help us mitigate some of the transactional volatility caused by changes in FX rates. This program will start to have some effect in the first quarter of 2014 and will be more fully in place by the end of 2014.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter are related to a $99 million increase in the charges associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune. These charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined. No insurance proceeds that may potentially be available to cover some of these costs have been included.", "Looking at sales in the fourth quarter. Our organic growth of 5.8% was comprised of a positive 7.3% from volume and mix, with price negatively impacting sales by 1.4%. Acquisitions added 1.5%, while FX had a negative 1.8% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year.", "Looking at our segments. Reconstructive represented 45% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Reconstructive products were up 5.8% as reported and grew 8% constant currency. U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 8.7% in the quarter. And despite facing challenging comps, Trauma and Extremities had another solid quarter in the U.S., with sales increasing 8.4%, led by new products, sales execution and continued strong growth in Foot & Ankle.", "U.S. hips and knees had strong growth in the period of approximately 10% and 8%, respectively. We are especially pleased with our knee performance, as we are going up against 2 new competitive knees that are well into their launch periods. We are still dealing with the absence from the market of our ShapeMatch Cutting Guides. And as Kevin mentioned, we are also against -- up against strong year-over-year comps of 7% in hips and 9% in knees from the fourth quarter of 2012. We believe this reflects the strength of both our Triathlon Knee and our highly-motivated sales team. Our international Reconstructive business was up 6.9% in constant currency and had organic growth of 2.4%.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 37% of our total sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 5.4% as reported and 6.6% on a constant currency basis. These results were led by both -- or by double-digit growth from our Endoscopy business and Medical had low-single digit growth, while Instruments have upper-single digit growth in the period. Instruments no longer had the Neptune comparison drag that it was going against in the first 9 months of this year and also had robust power tools sales in the quarter. We are pleased to once again have the Neptune product back in our portfolio of products as we move into 2014, now that we have the FDA approval.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of our sales and delivered another strong quarter. Sales increased 5.4% as reported and 7.5% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this segment was led by our IVS and our Neurovascular business, which grew solid double-digit in constant currency. Spinal implant sales were up slightly on a constant currency basis and double-digit internationally.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2013 were 66.3% compared to 68.3% in the same period last year. As we expected and highlighted in our last call, the rate this quarter was negatively impacted by the lower overhead absorption in the period as inventory levels were significantly reduced in the quarter after a build, which occurred in the third quarter to support our fourth quarter sales. We were also negatively impacted by nearly a full percentage point in both the quarter and the full year gross margin rates from the med-tech tax. Product mix was more balanced in the fourth quarter, also slightly reducing the margin rate as MedSurg, which has a lower gross margin than the company average, performed well without the headwinds from the Neptune recall.", "FX and price also had a negative impact on the rate this quarter, as we felt the full impacts of the weaker Japanese yen and Australian dollar in the quarter. For the full year, gross margins on an adjusted basis were 67.5%, down 60 basis points from 2012. However, the 2013 rate was negatively impacted by 90 basis points due to the med-tech tax. Excluding this item, the rate would have increased 30 basis points for the year.", "Research and development expenses increased by 10 basis points to 5.6% versus 5.4% -- or 5.5% last year in the quarter. This represents a 7.8% increase in R&D spending over last year and continues to reinforce our commitment to invest in areas which we believe will help us deliver above market sales growth in each of our key product categories.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 40.5% of sales in the fourth quarter, but this included approximately $99 million of cost related to the Rejuvenate, ABG II and Neptune recalls versus $174 million of similar cost in the fourth quarter of last year. On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $838 million or 34% of sales in the fourth quarter of 2013 versus 36.2% in the prior year's fourth quarter. The improvements in SG&A in the period were primarily in general and administrative expenses along with some lower marketing expenses in the period.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 25.3% in the fourth quarter of both 2013 and the fourth quarter of 2012. The rate was negatively impacted by the med-tech tax and pricing. However, those impacts were fully offset in the quarter from the strength of our year-end sales, operational improvements and also from lower general and administrative and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales.", "Other expense on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was $9.5 million compared to $12 million last year in the fourth quarter. This reduction in expense resulted primarily from gains on hedges and marketable securities. Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 10.3% while the adjusted effective tax rate was 23.6% for the fourth quarter, which is higher than our full year adjusted effective tax rate of 22.3%. This compares to a 24.7% adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year.", "As we move into 2014, we expect the full year rate will run closer to 23% with a higher rate in the first half. Remember, an extra year of tax benefit resulting from the renewal of tax extenders were included in the first quarter of 2013. While our 2014 guidance anticipates renewal of the tax extenders, they have not yet been approved by Congress and renewal and timing of them is still uncertain and may negatively impact our tax rate early in the year.", "We also anticipate tax benefits from the revised structure and move to a European headquarters location in the Netherlands. However, this is not expected to be in place until the second half of the year.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash and marketable securities versus $4.3 billion at the end of 2012. And we also have $2.7 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the year at 55 days, flat with the end of 2012 and 2 days better than the end of the third quarter. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 152, which was 33-day decrease sequentially and a 1-day reduction when measured against the prior-year quarter. Inventory levels significantly reduced in the quarter after a build, which occurred during the third quarter.", "Turning to cash flow. We had a strong cash generation for the full year with cash from operations of $1.886 billion compared to $1.657 billion in the prior year, an increase of approximately 14% over 2012. 2013 cash flow benefited from improved operational performance and lower tax payments. Capital expenditures were $195 million in 2013. However, are expected to run closer to $250 million to $300 million in 2014, as some capital spending is carrying over into this year and we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure.", "Finally, regarding share repurchases in 2013, we repurchased approximately $317 million worth of our stock, and we will have nearly $700 million still available for repurchase under our current authorization.", "Based on our solid sales achievement in 2013 and the current economic and market conditions, we are projecting organic growth or constant currency, x acquisitions, in a range of 4.5% to 6% for 2014. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by less than 1% for the full year of 2014 and will negatively impact adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.07 per share as we are further impacted by a weak Japanese yen and Australian dollar without the full benefit of our layered hedging program, which, as mentioned, won't be fully in place until the end of 2014.", "In 2014, our adjusted earnings per share will now include an adjustment for acquisition-related intangible amortization expense. If 2013 included this adjustment, adjusted diluted earnings per share would have been $4.49 per share versus the $4.23 per share we reported.", "Our 2014 guidance was -- for adjusted diluted earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.90 per share and includes an adjustment of approximately $0.35 per share for acquisition intangible amortization. To assist you further in your modeling, particularly in regards to our quarterly earnings progression, we are providing a few additional comments.", "We expect 45% of full year adjusted earnings per share to be achieved in the first half of the year, with the first quarter facing the stiffest headwinds. In the first quarter, we will be negatively impacted by a greater negative FX impact based on current rate assumptions. The additional tax benefit received in the first quarter of last year, where we benefited from an extra full year benefit from the 2012 tax extenders and uncertainty around the timing of the reinstatement of those extenders this year, along with tougher sales comps, especially in Trauma, as we benefited from a competitor recall in the category in the first quarter last year.", "Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I just wanted to understand just kind of the guidance, particularly what your assumptions are just around acquisition contribution because you just gave the organic number. So can you help us just to how to kind of think about how you guys are framing the benefit from the 2 acquisitions that you talked about earlier? And then, just to clarify your guidance, I just want to make sure I got the number right, $0.35 is what the acquisition of intangibles is excluded from the $4.75 to $4.90 number?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Hello, Kristen. The second part of your question, that's correct, the $0.35 is the number. The first part, we have been consistently guiding to organic sales growth, so the number that we're focused on internally is -- was organic growth excluding sales -- or excluding FX and acquisitions since, obviously, the -- our goal has been to accelerate that. We are not giving any forecast or target as it relates to acquisitions. MAKO, as you know, was obviously a publicly-traded company. I know many of the folks on the phone modeled it, and we haven't closed Patient Safety yet. So the goal -- the number that we're going to be focused on and we'll be providing guidance will be around that organic number.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Kristen, what I'd add is each year, we will be doing the same thing. So at the beginning of next year, we'll provide organic sales growth. And obviously, that will include MAKO next year.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. Perfect. And then, I guess, just on MAKO, can you maybe just provide any additional color? I know the commentary on the third quarter call was somewhat limited just in terms of the deal not having closed. But just how do we think about it from a longer-term perspective in terms of opportunities for cost synergies or just -- I know you're not giving your thoughts about directionally to whatever extent you can comment on how you see it potentially accelerating the growth of the Recon business.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Well, without a doubt, we did the deal because we do believe it is potentially transformational on orthopedic surgery and will allow us to drive meaningful market share gains. And so, that is the goal. Right now, the teams have literally only been together for a few weeks, since we just closed late last year. They're actively assessing different options and prioritizing those options. We were able to share that we expect to start the total knee trial in the first half of this year. That is the biggest opportunity that we see for robotic-assisted surgery. We're going to continue to use our sales and distribution capabilities to build on current indications, but the long-term potential really is around total knees, optimizing total hips and, longer term, the potential to introduce the next generation of implants that aren't feasible with the current instrumentation. So we'll continue to provide additional updates. Right now that's the clarity we have as the teams are looking at different options, but they haven't finalized beyond the comments I just provided. And then, again, we'll have more details beyond that as it will be part of the focus of the product fair at the September Analyst Meeting.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just from a financial perspective, you did give some color when you announced the deal. Is it fair to say that the dilution associated with the deal is similar to what's embedded within your 2014 guidance? Or is it coming in a little less or a little bit more based upon the amortization that you're assuming, I guess?", "William R. Jellison", "Yes. So I think in general, we did give guidance upfront on the MAKO side. We, obviously, won't be commenting moving forward on both the sales side of MAKO or the overall operating performance of MAKO. As Katherine just mentioned, kind of, the teams are just really getting together, looking at the integration and really deciding, kind of, what they're ultimately going to be able to deliver on both from a sales, operational or a margin expectation and also some of the SG&A leverage.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. So no comment on whether the dilution is still similar to what you guys originally...?", "William R. Jellison", "Yes, we won't be really talking about, kind of, the MAKO-specific performance moving forward. But we did give guidance upfront on the initial call there.", "Operator", "And next, we have David Lewis, Morgan Stanley online with a question.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Kevin, one quick question on MAKO. You gave us the timing for the total knee trial. Can you give us a sense of -- is that simply total knee? And can you provide any, sort of, bi-cruciate timelines? And do you think you're going to need a separate trial for a bi-cruciate system?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So I'd say it's a little early for the bi-cruciate. Honestly, we're just as Katherine mentioned, 3 weeks into the deal. And obviously, bi-cruciate has interest. Still, there's a long way to go yet to determine whether that will be more than just a niche. And so, later on this year, we'll be able to provide more color around our expectations, our timing. The teams are literally just going through their prioritization right now. If bi-cruciate does turn out to be a really big part of the market, we'll be delighted because, robotically-enabled, it's a very difficult procedure to do today just as the uni [ph] is difficult to do. So if it does become a big part of the market, we believe we'll be very well positioned. But it's just too early right now to comment on where that is in our portfolio and whether we'll need additional trials. That will be something that we'll provide later on the year.", "David R. Lewis - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Kevin, maybe 2 more quick ones for you. First of all, just on Trauma. Obviously, the highlights for '13, Recon numbers are very strong in the fourth quarter. One of your competitors is talking about transitioning their Trauma strategy, post the large acquisition for more internally focused in '13 to more externally focused in '14, maybe you can sort of talk about what have been sort of the key drivers of the Trauma strategy and your thoughts on Sustainability?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So this wasn't just 1 year in the making. So we've had a terrific strategy over the last 4, 5 years. We've been growing faster than the market consistently over those years, grounding out our product portfolio with primarily internally developed R&D projects. We also added the Memometal acquisition, which really helped turbocharge our Foot & Ankle division and Foot & Ankle results. But -- so this has been a progressive strategy of really making sure we have a complete offering, we have differentiated products and we've been winning accounts and converting business consistently over that period of time. So it wasn't a 1 year wonder, and it's something that we think we'll be very well positioned to continue to grow in the years ahead.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Rick Wise from Stifel is online with a question.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "I guess, my question -- let me start with the -- first with the EU. And you indicated that the EU turnaround, as evidenced, is continuing as positive for the third quarter in a row. Just any color there on where we are in the turnaround process and kind of growth you're expecting -- or we should expect in the year ahead?", "William R. Jellison", "Yes. So we're delighted with the performance in Europe. Frankly, it was a little ahead of our expectations as we started the year in terms of the turnaround. I would say we still have some challenges in Italy, which I've mentioned previously. It's still taking some time. Germany is the other country that's a little bit up and down. But other than those 2 countries, the rest of Europe is in really good shape, including Spain, which had historically been a challenged country. So pretty stable across all of our countries. Our leadership team is really performing well. They brought some real stability and closer customer connections. So now, we're looking for the next phase where we can really drive accelerated growth, primarily in the MedSurg area. So we really stabilized our implant business, but we still have opportunity to grow primarily in MedSurg. I'm looking forward to accelerated growth in the quarters and years ahead.", "Frederick A. Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "And, Kevin, just as a follow-up on the hip, knee and, for that matter, Trauma numbers. You're the third company in a row to report very solid numbers. Maybe just your latest thoughts on the market outlook for 2014. We've seen this unusual second half. I mean, can this continue into '14, or do you think it settles back?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So what I'd say to that is we saw this last year in the fourth quarter, a big fourth quarter and I think we're really going to know at the end of this first quarter. And I really would like to compare the 6 months -- first quarter of this year, fourth quarter of last year to the comparative 6 month period from the year before we can really determine whether this is an overall uptick in the market. Since the middle of last year, I felt that the market has been gradually improving. But that's really -- we're not going to know for sure. We've had 3 companies report -- we still have some more to report. But really, we're going to really only know until the end of the first quarter.", "Operator", "And we have Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan online with a question.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "It's actually Kim here for Mike. So I guess a couple of questions. The first is a little bit of a follow-up to Rick's question on the seasonality piece in the Recon market. So you talked a little bit about some of the factors weighing on your first quarter. And so, I'm just curious, how did you think about the Recon piece when you thought about the EPS guidance for the first quarter?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Kim, very similar to what we saw last year, there was seasonality in the first quarter, a little bit of softening in the first quarter. We have not baked in any extra effect whether it's due to uncertainty around ACA. It is possible that helps Q4 and will result in an offset. You're probably looking in the area of tens of basis points, which is again, why we go back. So just assuming it's the standard seasonality pattern and then we'll look at what those 6 month averages are to determine if we've seen some modest level of improvement in the recon market.", "Kimberly Weeks Gailun - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And the follow-up is for Bill on the gross margin piece, and I apologize if I missed this, but how are you thinking about the gross margin trend into the first half of the year and then for the full year of 2014?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. I think a couple of points there. I mean, first off, we really don't talk specifically about our gross profit expectations directly, but we generally talk about, kind of, our broader-based expectations on operating margins. And I think especially as -- based on the growth rates that we're talking about here, at this level of growth rate, we would expect and be driving for a certain amount of additional operating margin improvement. I think that's probably in this environment -- a little bit more of that is, obviously, coming out of the SG&A-related area versus the gross margin related area. But I think our expectations in general are for modest improvement on the gross margin rate and a little bit better improvement on the SG&A rates.", "Operator", "And we have Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein online with a question.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the Instruments' performance this quarter. I appreciate that you've anniversary-ed the Neptune launch. How much of the -- did -- were there any Neptune sales embedded in here? And maybe you can remind us of, kind of, what the historic run rate of Neptune is and kind of the acceleration then that we would presumably see from this level moving forward with Neptune back on the market?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Hello, Derrick. What we stated last year throughout the quarter is [indiscernible] market impacting us in roughly the high teens vicinity in terms of millions of dollars. We were still selling to existing customers who had filed the appropriate paperwork necessary, but we couldn't sell any new system. So that revenue -- lost revenue is reflective of that. There were no new revenue associated with that in the fourth quarter. I would remind you, Instruments benefited from strong power tools that we had several new launches in the early part of the year, targeted to small bone segment that also helped the growth performance. Going forward into this year, clearly, Neptune will be a part of it. We're going to be focused on existing customers early on in upgrading them. And you should really think about it being in around the third quarter when we're back to kind of hitting on all cylinders as it relates to the Neptune relaunch.", "Derrick Sung - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Okay. Great. And on MAKO, I appreciate that you're not going to be breaking out sales. Can you tell us how you'll be accounting for MAKO sales moving forward? Do those go into your knee sales where, within reconstructive, do they go in or there's a separate breakout?", "Katherine A. Owen", "If you look within it, the hip sales will be in hips, the knee sales will be in knees as it relates to implants. The capital and any related service will be in our other line along with sports medicine, bone cement and the other products in that. So it will be in those 3 buckets.", "Operator", "And we have Matthew Dodds from Citigroup online with a question.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "First, on SG&A, you really cranked that down year-over-year and sequentially. I know you highlighted it as G&A and marketing spend. Could you give us a little more color on -- was one more than the other? Was there anything else in there that really pulled it down this much?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. I mean, I'd say that the G&A was obviously the bigger piece of it, although marketing was some of it as well, too. I'd also say if you look at the broader based improvement that we had throughout 2013, which was in the neighborhood of 70, 80 basis points, that's kind of what you should be looking at within that space. And I think that, that also holds true if you look at, like, the second half of 2013. It's about the same level of improvement. So, yes, there's a lot of activities that's continuing to take place within that area. But I think that, that's probably more of a reasonable level of what you should have expected actually occurred in '13.", "Matthew J. Dodds - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And then, just one quick follow-up. Now you have MAKO, there's a lot more to talk about AAOS. Is there anything else in AAOS that you're going to highlight or you think is worthy of highlighting now?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Well, for the AAOS Meeting, we will do the traditional format that we've had, where we'll have the Group Investor Meetings and also the booth similar to prior years. There will be a number of new products that are either being launched or we anticipate launching shortly. I think you should think about them within the normal range of the type of largely incremental, but meaningful innovation for the various segments.", "Operator", "And we have Bob Hopkins from Bank of America online with a question.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So, Bill, just to start, on the guidance, on a cash basis, excluding amortization, it looks like you're, for 2014, guiding to about 6% to 9% EPS growth. And I was wondering if you could just walk through some of the things that are diluting that growth? I think you mentioned FX has a $0.07 hit, and there are still some -- even excluding amortization, I would imagine there's a little bit of MAKO dilution. Just what are the things that are, kind of, diluting that growth rate in 2014 that we maybe want to look through potentially?", "William R. Jellison", "Yes, I think a couple of things. It's really -- the 2 biggest areas are really FX, which we highlighted that it's about $0.07 per share. And then, also, from an overall tax rate perspective, a couple of things. One, you remember, in 2012, we actually had a double year benefit, 2012 and '13 benefit, from the reinstatement of the tax extenders that are out there. So for sure, we'll be 1 year less of those tax extenders. And right now, our guidance does include that we will have tax extenders in 2014. However, they currently aren't renewed by Congress. And so, the benefit of those will probably come later on in the middle of the year, hopefully. However, we still, obviously, need to watch that and make sure that Congress approves that. Those are the 2 primary areas that are out there.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And, Bob, excluding those -- if you exclude those 2 impacts, the operational EPS improvement would be 10%, would be double-digit growth, which is kind of -- based on the organic growth rate that we're driving, that's the type of leveraged earnings gains that we're aiming for. And obviously, we're looking for benefits across the P&L, whether it's in the cost of goods area, in the SG&A area to be able to deliver that leverage. Unfortunately, based on the way the exchange rates have moved and the timing of getting our hedging program in place, if rates stay where there are, we are going to be negatively impacted and FX is certainly the biggest impact.", "William R. Jellison", "Yes. And then, FX impact will probably be much more prominent in the first of the year versus the second half.", "Robert A. Hopkins - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. Great. That's exactly what I was looking for. And then, as a follow-up on the hip and knee side, Kevin, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more -- just remind us of what's going on in Asia on the knee side and why you have confidence that, that will come back? And I was wondering if you could just provide any sort of qualitative sense as to some of the earlier questions . Other companies have suggested that they're seeing backlogs build into 2014 and that, therefore, perhaps, we should be optimistic that some of these good growth rates we're seeing is probably more the economy than seasonality. I'm just wondering if you're seeing anything similar.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So on the second question, Bob, obviously, we're in the middle of a quarter right now, and I'm not going to really comment on how things are going in January. There are a lot of anecdotes, I prefer not to really comment on anecdotes. And we'll -- let's see how the first quarter rolls before we really can reach a conclusion on whether this is a real change in the trend. Clearly, we're happy with our fourth quarter performance. There were a lot of expectations that our knee business would be under stress with competitive launches and having to overcome not having ShapeMatch on the market. Certainly, our knee has been a very, very well chronicled knee with very, very low complication rates with very, very low revision rates and our sales force has done a terrific job. So we're certainly growing, at least, with the market, and we feel very good about our performance.", "Operator", "And we have Mike Matson from Needham & Company online with a question.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "I guess, just given the description of where you're going to be recording the revenue from MAKO, it sounds like that's largely going to be housed in the Orthopaedics business. So are you going to have the capital reps stay in the Orthopaedics side of the business? I guess, how are you going to be selling that product, the capital? And then, how does that sort of fit with the Navigation products [indiscernible] Instruments?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So the way it's being done right now, all of the sales from MAKO will be reported in the Orthopaedics group, and we have a separate capital sales force, which is the way MAKO was running their organization. A separate capital group selling the robot and implant sales reps. The separate capital group will be separate from Navigation. And again, these are different solutions. So there are surgeons that prefer to use standard instruments. There are surgeons that like to use cutting blocks. There are surgeons that prefer Navigation with intraoperative Navigation and remember that Navigation is the fastest-growing part of Navigation is actually in neuro, not just in the ortho area. And then, there are surgeons that like robotics. So we are going to have solutions for every surgeon preference. And we are keeping separate capital sales forces for the robotics group and the instruments group, and that will continue to drive its growth as it has done actually quite well this year.", "Michael Matson - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And you had -- you did a great job with working capital this year over $500 million. It looks like coming out working capital really helping your cash flow from operations. But it sounds like capital spending is going to be up, and that working capital performance is probably a hard act to follow, so is it reasonable to assume that free cash flow could be down in '14 over '13?", "William R. Jellison", "I mean, if you look at the free cash flow side, I think that CapEx is really the -- one of the key drivers associated with that, and we do expect capital expenditures to be running higher in 2013. So that's a fair statement. As far as the other components of the cash flow are concerned, we obviously have continued efforts on our working capital side of the equation. But we would expect our overall operating cash flow to show some improvements, but our overall free cash flow might be a little bit tighter just based on the CapEx that we're spending.", "Operator", "And we have Raj Denhoy from Jefferies online with a question.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "I wonder if I could ask about the Foot & Ankle business. I think I asked about it the last quarter too when you grew 39%. In this quarter, you were 36% again. I guess, how sustainable should we look at that? I mean, that business is not small for you anymore. It must be $150 million or so. Maybe you could just speak about the trends you're seeing there and again just that sustainability of that growth?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. We're really excited about our Foot & Ankle business. And because it's a market development where you're really going after podiatrists that never used implants, there's really a very, very big run way for growth, and we're experiencing that. Certainly, last year in the fourth quarter, we had close to 40% growth, another 36% growth on top of that in the U.S. So really exciting. Even worldwide, we're seeing very good growth. So I wouldn't have thought at the beginning of the year that we would have delivered a number this big coming off of last year, but when you're in new markets, it's a lot harder to predict than when you're in mature markets. So we're really excited. This is really about market expansion and getting these products into the hands of physicians that were not previously using implants. So we believe double-digit growth, for sure, for a number of quarters going forward. But again, given that it's market development, it's a little hard to predict; and we're, obviously, very pleased with our performance in this area.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, maybe if I could just ask about Trauson. I think you made comments -- you have made comments about 2014 being the year where you'll look at expanding those products out of the Chinese market into other emerging markets. I don't think you've given too much detail beyond that and I don't know if you're willing to offer much more in terms of the markets you're targeting and really your expectations for that effort.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "For competitive reasons, I'd really rather not get into exactly which countries. It is an emerging markets play. So you can imagine that we'll be going into different emerging markets over the course of the year. And as we start to sell in those businesses, we'll keep you posted but not really willing to share more right now.", "Operator", "And we have Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners online with a question.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Just -- first, just related to the SG&A spending reduction or the cost control, can you talk about how much of that was related to any pullback in the direct-to-consumer advertising campaign that you had?", "Katherine A. Owen", "There was a portion of it. As we said throughout the year, each quarter we are reevaluating the mix, so we continued the DTC campaign, but I would say the prior quarter had more TD. This quarter -- or the fourth quarter of '13 had other less expensive mix of the median that is part of what was behind Bill's comments related to lower expenses tied to that.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And just with respect to MAKO and your strategy outside the U.S. or kind of what you're seeing initially -- and obviously, you have resources that are much more significant than what MAKO had outside the U.S. And I was wondering, is there anything that immediately you're identifying that you could be doing differently or how much of a near-term opportunity is there for you to capitalize on something that they just couldn't do?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I wouldn't say that's a near-term opportunity. Obviously, longer term, we think about these opportunities not just for MAKO, but other products from a global perspective. But near term, it's really focused on [indiscernible] educations, getting the clinical trials and evaluating the different options available to us. I would think that -- think about that as being the longer term opportunity.", "Operator", "And we have Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets online with a question.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Can we take a look at the capital spending environment? At your Analyst Meeting in September, you've highlighted that, that might be one area that benefits from the implementation of the ACA.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Long term, that is not reflected in our top line target for this year. Medical was obviously challenged in the fourth quarter. It will have a difficult comparison in the first quarter. We continue to be cautious regarding the capital spending for those larger ticket items, and that's clearly where medical falls in. If there's a benefit from ACA, we don't think we'll see it until later this year. But I wouldn't view it as a meaningful driver, certainly, not reflected in our 2014 guidance.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And my second question has to do with the Extremities sales. Once again, a 30%-plus quarter in the United States. You're taking share from somebody. Can you just comment broadly on what you see in that market?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So again, I go back to -- really, we're focused on growing the market, much more than we're focused on taking share. Obviously, there's some cases where we are taking market share, but the bulk of our growth is really new physicians doing procedures that they were not using implants, they're either using K-wires or other approaches. So to us, this is much more a market expansion story than it is a market share story.", "Operator", "And we have Matt Taylor from Barclays online with a question.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I'm just curious. This is a small piece of your business, but I was wondering if you can give us any color around the slowdown in Sustainability Solutions and what's causing that?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, we did have a slowdown in the quarter. That business is susceptible to the timing of OEM product launches, and there were several of those. And then, the teams have to go back and do the appropriate product development in order to get a corresponding reprocessed product on the market. We did launch some products late last year and anticipated additional product launches this year. You combine that with the still very clear compelling rationale for reprocessing products, we believe that business will get back to double-digit growth. But it will vary quarter-to-quarter because, obviously, we can't control the timing of some of those OEM launches.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And with each OEM change, we have to resubmit a 510(k). So that's the timing difference. This occurred primarily in the energy area with 2 of our competitors that changed our products and has caused us a bit of delay. We've very excited and bullish about this year for Sustainability as we get those 510(k)s and return to the market.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And one area we didn't talk about yet was -- just if you could give us any comment on overall market health and dynamics of both Neuro and Spine markets? Have you seen anything changing there? It seems like, overall, we've seen pretty strong growth in Neuro and maybe some bounce-back in Spine, like we've seen in Ortho. But I'm curious to see if you see anything new there.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So we really love being in the neuroscience space. It's a great market. There's still plenty of room for growth. That's one of our -- certainly our better and more attractive markets and pleased that we acquired Neurovascular to really round out our portfolio with our other divisions in this space. And Spine, clearly, the worst is, I think, behind us. It's bottomed down at least and it's starting to stabilize. Pricing is starting to stabilize. We're starting to see a bit -- a little bit of an uptick. So I think that's a market, certainly, not getting worse. It's, at least, stable and maybe modestly starting to improve.", "Operator", "And we have Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets online with a question.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just on the gross margin here in the fourth quarter down 200 basis points year-over-year, can you quantify the difference year-over-year? For example, was it 100% FX -- 100 basis points FX, 100 basis points lower plant utilization? Any color would be helpful.", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. As I mentioned, as far as year-over-year goes, it\u2019s probably about nearly a full point just from the impact of the med-tech tax and then also with FX being the biggest hit in the fourth quarter of this year, FX was definitely another large piece of that. It was impacting us by over 0.5 percentage point on the FX side alone. So when you look at kind of the other aspects with some of the absorption side, that was lower but then also the mix, because of all the businesses performing well within the year and the MedSurg business actually having lower margins in general than our average business, those are probably the 4 big components of it.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And then, for 2014, we have the Japanese price cuts. So I'm sure that's in your guidance. What are you assuming there? And then, also, will we have the same number of selling days in 2014 as 2013?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, the selling days are outlined in the slide of the webcast. You can see where they do vary and where they are same year-over-year. With respect to the Japanese price cuts, still pretty certain that they will be negative. It is reflected in our overall expectations for total price, which is typically down in the 1% to 2% range for the company. Exactly where it shakes out, we just don't know yet. We haven't heard any early rumblings yet, but we expect it to be consistent with prior years, give or take.", "Operator", "And we have David Roman from Goldman Sachs online with a question.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I want to come back to Trauson for a second. I think it's been about a year since you've closed that transaction either March of 2013. Maybe you could provide us some updates on how that business is trending and to what extent you've been successful in integrating that to expand your EM footprint. Kevin, I think, at a recent investor conference, you quoted EM sales at about, I think, 6% or 7% of corporate average. Maybe just any update on how that business is going both Trauson and more broadly EM.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So we're really excited about the acquisition. Obviously, it's our first deal in China, first time getting into the lower-priced segment and really pleased that the business hit the acquisition model in their first year. So we're very pleased about that. We focused very much on China, making sure we kept the momentum in the growth going well in China. So in the fourth quarter, our emerging markets as a percent of total company sales was 8%. In 2012, in the prior year, it was 6% for the full year. This year, it's more in the 7% range. And obviously, it's been increasing throughout the course of the year with Trauson being the biggest driver. So you would expect next year when we report our full year results that emerging markets will be over 8% of total company sales. So we're on a march. And clearly, the goal is to get emerging markets not just because of Trauson but because we're also growing very well in the premium segment in China, in Brazil, in India and other emerging markets. So we're focused on both parts of the market. Clearly, our medium-term goal is to get that above double-digit percent of total company, while also maintaining good growth rates in the U.S. and picking up the growth in Europe. Clearly, the markets are growing faster, and we believe Trauson gives us a great entry into that low-priced segment. So, so far so good is what I would say on emerging markets, going from 6% a year ago with 7% this year to over 8% in 2014. So very excited about the progress.", "David H. Roman - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, on the gross margin line, understandably, at any 1 quarter, there are going to be a number of moving parts. But just thinking longer term, how should we think about the trajectory of gross margins, particularly in the context of 1.5-ish-percent annual price decline that is $150 million annual headwind you have, you have the restructuring that you've talked a lot about mix will ebb and flow, I mean, is a lot of this just plus 1s and minus 1s that all kind of net out to flattish? Can gross margins go higher? And then, just lastly, on cash EPS, are you going to give us any more historical information than what you've provided today?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. So I think, maybe the broader context is really kind of what I stated about kind of the full year gross margin rate. So if you look at the gross margins for the full year, it was 67.5%, which was down about 60 basis points for the year. But keep in mind, that included 90 basis points of an impact from the med-tech tax. So despite the fact that price also played a part in putting pressure on that -- on those rates, we actually would have been up about 30 basis points in gross margin rates this year despite the price if we had excluded the med-tech tax. So I think, in general, our expectations and some of the initiatives that we've got in our GQO area, which is our global quality and operations area, we believe that we've got some good programs in there that are continuing to take place over the next few years. And we're still driving for slight improvement in the gross margin rate as a contributing factor to our overall operating margin rate improvements.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Just to add to Bill's comments, this is the second year in a row -- consecutive year where we had gross margin expansion. So regardless of the price pressure that we're facing, which we expect to continue, we've demonstrated now consistent ability to raise gross margins. This is part of our overall GQO program. We're well into the 2.5 years into this program, which is a 5-year program. We've delivered 2 years in a row now of gross margin expansion, and we expect to continue that. This is one of the levers that enable us to drive operational earnings at a faster rate in our top line sales.", "Katherine A. Owen", "And just to your follow-up, we do not plan to provide any additional historical information as it relates to the new adjusted EPS.", "Operator", "And we have Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray online with a question.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "I got one question and one follow-up. So one, Kevin, I think you mentioned, in looking at MAKO and rolling it out through your organization into your hospital and surgical customers, that there are some folks who are going to like robots, some folks like traditional instruments. On the other hand, as Katherine said, it's pretty disruptive technology, at least, potentially over the intermediate and long term. Do you envision yourselves as kind of leading the transition to greater use of robotic surgery in orthopedics? Or do you view yourselves as sort of -- this is part of your portfolio of advanced technology for the OR, orthostats or ShapeMatch and other things being part of that? And then, I have one follow-up.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So obviously, we -- this move was made to really drive market share and become the clear leader in reconstructive surgery. So I would not assume we're going to be passive about the way that we sell this technology. But surgeons take different times to convert. There are some that will convert very quickly, early adopters. There's others that will wait a little bit before they'll start to convert, and there are some that will be very stubborn and want to stick to their tried and proved approaches. So we will have approaches for all types of surgeons. But without a doubt, we plan to rapidly move the adoption of robotic surgery. This is a big play that we're -- we've made, and we're not going to be passive about really taking this to the market. Certainly, our implant sales force is extremely excited about being able to sell the implants, so they can be associated with the robots, leveraging their own relationships. So, yes, I wouldn't assume we're going to be in a \"sit back and wait\" mode related to robotics. Again, only 3 weeks since close. But make no mistake, we're going to be leaning forward.", "Matthew S. Miksic - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Well, I look forward to that. The follow-up I had was also on orthopedics on the knee side, you mentioned sort of looking to Q1 as sort of a benchmark to maybe see is this real, is the recovery real on the back of what were pretty great results in U.S. knees. What I'm thinking about Q1 as you mentioned in your presentation, there is an extra selling day. I know other folks are either going to have an extra selling day, or they're going to go against the quarter last year when they were missing a day or 2, do you expect, I mean, the setup is reasonably good for a pretty decent Q1 here?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would just go back to the comments we made. We really tried to single out some of the headwinds that are more significant in the first quarter that when you go back and fine-tune your models, you should really think about reflecting particularly the EPS line, and I would just refer to those. We're really not looking for an exaggerated impact from seasonality in the first quarter. But there are some very clear specifics that are -- that we highlighted, whether it's FX, year-over-year comparables, tax extenders, all of which I would take a look at when you're updating your models.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And maybe I'll just take the opportunity to also comment on hips since I've gotten a lot of questions on knees mostly because of the competitive launches and having ShapeMatch off the market. But I'm really pleased with our hip performance and that -- again, like our Trauma business, that has been 3 years in the making of consistently leading the market, especially in the U.S., but also great performance outside the U.S. So we're really pleased with our hip growth and which has been on the back of a number of new product launches and excellent execution in the field.", "Operator", "And we have Matthew O'Brien from William Blair online with a question.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I was hoping to once again go back to MAKO, but you guys mentioned the total knee trial that you're about to engage in and when we look at the uni knee opportunity, there was a wow factor there with a challenging case in terms of performing those procedures. And then, with the hip opportunity, cuff replacement [ph], was a big deal. But can you just tell us what is the big wow factor for total knees? Are we going to be able to actually gain market share versus converting your own physicians over there? And then, within there, I know you've done a lot of internal work on the robotics side of things. Should we expect that, that after case of new robots applications from Stryker going forward than maybe traditionally you performed -- or you execute at?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. When we look at the total knee opportunity, which we think is the most compelling, it's around being able to improve the patient experience, patient satisfaction absolutely varies. It is not as high as it is in hips with respect to knees. It's about being able to drive consistently reproducible results regardless or not so much being tied to simply having the best surgeon doing the surgery. And longer term, we believe it's going to open up the opportunity that's not possible with manual instrumentation today regardless of surgeon expertise for a new generation of implants that will further improve outcomes, patient experience and also benefit the hospitals. So it's that combined effect that we believe will really be the wow factor. It's premature to start talking about the cadence of robotics product launches at this stage. Clearly, we believe we have expertise in this area that is helping to augment what MAKO brings to the table, and we also understand the implant and the capital selling process. But beyond that, we really again -- just a few weeks in, we've tried to share some of the early decisions that we've been able to reach, we'll provide more information as it becomes available and as we have agreement internally around what priorities we're going to focus on.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. And then, just a quick follow-up. You talked about the -- I think, Kevin, you mentioned in the past, introducing a reverse shoulder system to augment what you have on the anatomical side. Any update as far as when you're going to launch that product? And then, I don't believe you have a specialized sales force selling upper extremity products. Is there a thought that you're going to go more aggressively down that path?", "Katherine A. Owen", "So as it relates to the launches that you're talking about, we do anticipate getting the reverse shoulder out starting in the second quarter, but it will really be fully launched around the third quarter of this year. There's a big gap in our portfolio. We have not traditionally been strong in the shoulder market. We have a hybrid approach in many of the areas where we compete, where we have dedicated reps and we have a full-line reps. We believe it's something that really helps us, be it Extremities, Trauma, as well as Reconstructive. We'll be leveraging a similar format as we look to gain increased traction now that we've rounded out the reverse -- or the portfolio on shoulders with the addition of the reverse later this year.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. So just to provide a little more color. So the early launch will be in selected hospitals. That will start towards the end of the first quarter, beginning of the second quarter, full launch towards the end of the second quarter.", "Operator", "And we have Bruce Nudell from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse online with a question.", "Matthew Keeler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "This is Matt in for Bruce. First, can you maybe share with us what the different segment growth rates are there embedded in your 2014 guidance?", "Katherine A. Owen", "If you're talking about as it relates to Recon, MedSurg, Neurotech, no, we don't provide that level of granularity. Kevin commented around Neurotech being a higher growth area, and I think people have their various estimates related to the biggest segments, but we're just providing a top line number and that was reflected in the comments on the call.", "Matthew Keeler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Or maybe, if not that, what are some of the puts and takes to get you to the edges of that range?", "Katherine A. Owen", "When we tried on the call to give some color around some of the headwinds and as well as tailwinds, some of the comparables, some of which are more challenging in certain areas of the quarter. I will give you, for example, because given the breadth of our product portfolio, all the different divisions, I don't think it's feasible or realistic to go through all the different puts and takes. But something like our Trauma business, as they can continue to maintain momentum throughout the year despite tough comps, despite the J&J that's further into their integration, that's a potential extra that could be reflected, but I could also list off a bunch of headwinds that could be more challenging. We tried to do that and look at all of those which is reflected in the range that we gave. If more of those break positively, we'll be closer to the high end of that range. That's always the goal. But at this point, we've learned pretty clearly over the years there's always something that surprises us in any given year. So that's all reflected in that 4.5% to 6%.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. What's encouraging from our standpoint though is that this is a step-up in our organic growth rate versus the guidance we gave a year ago. So we are overall feeling better about our performance in terms of organic sales growth. The overall range is a step-up, and it's a very good growth rate, especially when you consider this does not include MAKO, which we will be aggressively going after in 2014.", "Matthew Keeler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Sure. Then just one quick follow-up, as far as the guidance this year, do you assume pricing as roughly consistent with what you saw in 2013? Are there any changes?", "Katherine A. Owen", "No, same expectations, negative 1% to 2%, usually bounces around in that range.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "So on MAKO, we saw the Q3 results. They were a little bit weak on the system sales. Can you give us any color on whether that rebounded in Q4? And I just have one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen", "We had really minimal sales, obviously, reflected given the timing of the acquisition in our numbers, so it wasn't material. I'm not going to get into color on the full quarter sales. I know you guys got a lot of details for MAKO when they went public. But given the size of it is relative to Stryker, for example, we don't break out our Navigation systems sales either in entirety or by indication and we're not going to get into that level of granularity. We will try to provide more color as it becomes more significant. But at this point, it's just not material enough for us to be breaking it out.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "On the build -- on the R&D tax credit and what you're assuming in the guidance, just to be clear, it sounds like you're assuming it's renewed later in the year. So from a modeling standpoint, you're going to get the whole benefit of 2014 in Q4, or should we be assuming equal benefit by quarter? It's just a little bit unclear how you're handling that this year.", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. So our expectation is that it will get approved as we move through this year. When it gets approved is the question. So as you watch and see when that actually occurs. If it, for example, doesn't happen until the second quarter, we would pick up, in essence, a 0.5 year benefit in the second quarter and the rest of it in each of the last 2 quarters. If it gets approved in the fourth quarter of this year, then we wouldn't pick up any of that tax rate benefit really until the last quarter, and we pick up a full year's benefit of that. If, for whatever reason, they decide not to extend it, then obviously that would be a negative impact on, at least, the guidance that we currently got out there.", "Operator", "And we have Josh Jennings from Cowen and Company online with a question.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I was just hoping you could share with us -- your 4.5% to 6% organic top line guidance -- growth guidance, if you could share with us your assumptions. We don't want to get ahead of ourselves with some of the positive trends we've been seeing. But were your base case assumptions for Recon growth in the U.S. for hips and knees?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would -- the way we're looking at it right now, going back to Kevin's comments about feeling like it was modestly, medium modestly in the tens of bps vicinity, modest improvement starting in the second half of the year. We're going to look at the average between Q4 and Q1, compare it year-over-year and I think what you'll see is a modest, again, tens of bps improvement in the recon market, and that's largely reflected in our sales guidance. But I will tell you that I wouldn't assume 20, 30, 40, whatever it is, bps as a meaningful impact in that range. It's reflected in it.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Great. And then, just a follow-up quickly on your views on the threat of generic reconstructive joint implants coming into the market in -- potentially in midyear by a larger player, how big of a threat is that? And then, lastly, just on share count expectations, with the stock price where it is, share count is basically flat '13 over '12. Is there any way to give some guidance on share count expectations for 2014?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes. I'll jump in and take the last part of it. You, obviously, have our EPS guidance and I will just emphasize, our capital allocation strategy has been and will continue to be focused, first and foremost, on acquisitions to help drive organic sales growth. We're also committed to growing the dividend at rates above the growth of earnings rate and then buybacks. Now buybacks will vary from quarter-to-quarter, but that's a long-term strategy we have in place around a 3-pronged cash strategy allocation.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes, you should assume each year is a certain level of buybacks, not unlike the kind of buyback level that we had this year, but it does -- it will range based on what's happening in the marketplace and where our cash position is. Really to the first part of your question -- and I really don't see generic hips and knees as being really a viable option in the near term because the procedures are very difficult to do. So until the procedures are de-skilled, which has been the case in some other parts of med-tech, when a procedure is very easy to do and you don't need a sales rep performing the high level of services that's required to enable patient outcomes, then generics take off. There's a reason why, in China, you have a low-priced segment that does not include hips and knees, and it does not include hips and knees because these procedures are very difficult to do. That low-priced segment, which we are now participating in through Trauson, is a Spine and Trauma market. And so, I don't really perceive this as a major threat. We're always going to keep our eyes open. But frankly, until you de-skill these procedures, the sales force representation is extremely important. At Stryker, we don't put sales reps in OR to help sell power tools every time a surgeon is using a power tool because the surgeon doesn't need a rep helping him use the power tool. The surgeon does need reps when they're doing hip and knee replacement whether they are primary procedures and certainly when there are revision procedures.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Lichtman from Oppenheimer.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Kevin, just in MedSurg, obviously, you've had a strong new product cycle in Endo and in Instruments in the past couple of years. As you look to '14, have those rollouts completed now, or do you expect them still to be incremental driver this year versus 2013?", "Katherine A. Owen", "If I would know -- in power tools, in large power tools, we've just anniversary-ed the launch of the System 7 and you typically see 3- to 4-year life cycle there. And obviously, the growth starts to slow as you get to the latter part. Conversely, we launched our new products in the early part of '13 within Instruments, the Cd4 and the Sabo. Those are targeted at small bone and are seeing very nice growth, which helps contribute to that 8% U.S. gain in the quarter. We'll have additional products that we'll be launching in '14 and some of those which we'll highlight at the upcoming AAOS Meeting.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Yes. And I would tell you the Instruments group is extremely excited because Neptune, although we've been servicing our existing accounts, we haven't been able to sell new capital. So in some ways, you might want to think of that almost like a new product because we're now going to be bringing back capital equipment to the market. Obviously, in the first half of the year, we have to service our existing accounts. We need to retrofit their equipment, but they're really going to be looking to go after that. In addition, Patient Safety Technologies, which we expect to close some time in the first quarter, will give Instruments another shot in the arm as a brand-new product, which frankly with all the relationships and them knowing how to sell patient and caregiver safety, just ideally positioned and those should be an engine for growth, even though once again that growth in this year is outside of our guidance, it certainly will help our top line performance.", "Steven M. Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then, Kathy, you mentioned relative to fourth quarter MAKO contribution for overall corporate obviously not material. But just to clarify, on the individual product lines that you guys reported or talked about on the call in knees and hips, did that include some MAKO in the fourth quarter or are those just pure Stryker year-over-year growth?", "Katherine A. Owen", "There was some. But I will stress, we closed very late in the year. It was not meaningful whether it's total Stryker or even if you look at the hips and knees. We're very pleased with the growth we put up even adjusting for the very, very modest impact from a few days of selling.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division", "First, just on Extremities, do you have a total ankle or one in the works? And then, secondly, as we look at the MAKO, when specifically would you expect to have the Stryker implants compatible with the software for MAKO?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Okay. Thank you. I'll start with the total ankle. So, no, we do not have a total ankle currently in our portfolio. As you know, the total ankle market is not growing at a very fast rate. It's certainly not slowing down our growth whatsoever. Over time, I think we will want to have a total ankle within our portfolio. We've evaluated a number of different options, and we frankly discounted some of them because when we do come to market, we want to make sure that it's going to be with a product that is a really compelling product whether we do that through internal development or whether we do that some other way, we'll keep you posted. But it's not something we feel a burning desire for. We don't need it today. Where -- you can see our performance has been outstanding in Foot & Ankle without the total ankle. But over time, just like we saw with hips and knees, in the early days, joint replacement takes time to build up clinical track record, to build up experience, to get the right materials. So it's still -- longer term, it's of a high interest to us. It's not something that preoccupies me in the short term.", "Katherine A. Owen", "And I would just say that more to come on the timing for when we would look to launch and which areas Stryker implants on the robot. It's clearly a part of the long-term value proposition. But we're just going through with the R&D team's working jointly together and looking at those in the -- at the timing, et cetera, associated with that. So more to come.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Thank you, all, for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter of 2014 results will be held on April 17. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Eric and I'll be your operator for today's call. (Operator Instructions) This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may begin sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's first quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy & Investor Relations.", "Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update as it relates to our recent M&A activity and Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before opening the call up to Q&A. Our first quarter results reinforce the strength of our diversified mix of businesses which include implants, disposables, capital equipment and services that address a broad spectrum of the medical technology industry.", "With this comprehensive offering, we achieved another quarter of solid organic sales growth, up 5% excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange. While we benefited from one extra selling day in the quarter, this was offset by the negative impact from the unusually severe weather, which resulted in a high number of cancelled surgeries.", "As these surgeries are being rescheduled over the course of the year, we do not anticipate any discernable impact on our full year growth rates. All three of our key business segments, Reconstructive, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine delivered year-over-year revenue gains in Q1 and growth was well balanced between the U.S. and international.", "In the U.S., trauma and extremities posted an impressive growth of 12% off of a tough 26% comparable which was aided by competitor recall last year. This growth was fueled by continued strength in Foot & Ankle, up 34%. Hip growth of 6% and knee growth of 4% reflected seasonality and some disruption associated with the MAKO acquisition.", "As publicly traded competitors, we were only able to start our integration discussions after the deal closed late last year. With that planning taking place over the course of the first quarter. During this period, we experienced hesitancy by our sales reps as well as some customers to move forward ending visibility around the integration specifics.", "Starting in April, we now have the benefit of a unified sales force. With this key step in place, we are well positioned to leverage our considerable sales and distribution capabilities to drive sales growth going forward. U.S. MedSurg was led by robust growth in instruments, up 13% as the team is capitalizing on the linked 2013 510K clearance of the Neptune Waste Management System.", "Endoscopy had another solid quarter. Medical was steady while Sustainability Solutions was slowed by some product lifecycle challenges. U.S. Neurotechnology had another stellar quarter with 11% growth at all three businesses, Neurovascular, Neuropowered Instruments and CMS registered double-digit gains. Spine growth was flat aided by double-digit growth in Interventional Spine.", "International constant currency growth of 5% was led by strong performances in Australia, Japan, India, and China. The latter of which had strong performance in both the premium and low-priced segment of the market.", "Europe momentum continues with year-over-year growth in the low single-digits. Most product categories had positive results, although knees were soft due primarily to lingering issues in some emerging market countries which we previously mentioned. We continue to expect this trend to improve beginning in Q2.", "Turning to the P&L. The year-over-year decline in gross margin is a function of the negative impact from foreign exchange along with price which was partly offset by the benefit from our GQO initiative. We continue to make significant investments in R&D which increased 17% year-over-year, while maintaining our focus on driving greater SG&A efficiencies.", "With our adjusted Q1 EPS of $1.06 we are confirming our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $4.75 to $4.90. With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "", "My comments on today's call will focus on providing an update on our recent M&A activity. During Q1 we acquired Pivot Medical which was founded in 2007 with a focus on hip arthroscopy procedures treating FAI syndrome. Pivot provides us with a platform of innovative instrumental implants to efficiently access and restore the mobility of the hip with minimal incision.", "Hip arthroscopy is the fastest growing procedure in sports medicine resulting from improved procedural solution and growing demand for solution. This acquisition complements our existing sports medicine portfolio and provides our customers with a comprehensive offering to address a broader range of procedures.", "More recently, we completed the acquisition of Berchtold Holding, which achieved sales in 2013 of approximately $125 million to its product portfolio of surgical infrastructure equipment. Berchtold offering includes surgical table, equipment films and surgical lighting systems geared towards maximizing efficiency and safety in operating rooms and IT use.", "Combining these complementary solutions with our endoscopy division\u2019s existing operating room portfolio creates a comprehensive quality focused offering equipped to satisfy a wide range of customers\u2019 needs around the globe.", "Also during the quarter we closed on the acquisition of Patient Safety Technologies which we discussed in detail on our prior call. Our Instruments division is excited about this innovative technology which helps prevent the objects in the operating room thereby improving patient safety and reducing healthcare costs.", "Finally, as it relates to MAKO, during Q1 we initiated enrollment in a clinical study of a total knee application using MAKO\u2019s Total Knee System. We are excited about this opportunity to further broaden the clinical application for this technology and anticipate having the Total Knee on the market in 2015.", "We are excited about these recent transactions and the opportunity for our division to leverage the considerable sales and marketing infrastructure to help drive accelerating revenue growth.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.", "William Jellison", "", "Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was positive by 5.3% in the first quarter, including a negative 1.1% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was a positive 6.4%, which includes organic growth of 5%.", "Earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the first quarter were $0.18 per share versus $0.79 per share last year in the first quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.06 per share for the quarter versus $1.09 in the first quarter last year. This quarter's EPS includes a negative impact of approximately $0.05 per share from FX this quarter compares into the last year\u2019s first quarter is also negatively impacted by approximately $0.05 per share both from tax extenders not being renewed and also from an additional full year benefit for the 2012 tax extenders booked in the first quarter of last year.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter are related to a $340 million increase in the charges associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II and Neptune. These charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined. No insurance proceeds that may potentially be available to cover some of these costs have been included.", "Looking at sales in the first quarter. Our organic growth of 5% was comprised of a positive 6.9% from volume and mix, with price negatively impacting sales by 1.8%. Acquisitions added 1.4%, while FX had a negative 1.1% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese yen and the Australian dollar compared to the same period last year. This impact should lessen considerably as we move through the year if rates fall near current levels.", "Looking at our segments, Reconstructive represented 43% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Reconstructive products were up 4.5% as reported and grew 5.9% constant currency. U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 8% in the quarter, Trauma and Extremities once again had another solid quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 11.6%, with continued strength in Foot & Ankle as we work to expand that market.", "U.S. hips and knees growth in the period were 5.9% and 4.4%, respectively and we believe the strong fourth quarter did hold some activity out of the first quarter. We expect sales growth to accelerate in 2014 and look forward to a Total Knee launch in 2015.", "Our International Reconstructive business is up 2.9% in constant currency and have low single-digit organic growth in the period.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our total sales in the quarter. At the beginning of the year we moved all of our Sports Med implants previously reported in our Recon business segment to a newly created sports med unit under common leadership in our endoscopy division. This business is reported up through our MedSurg business segment. 2013 segment information is also been restated to consistently reflect this move.", "Total MedSurg sales increased 5.8% as reported and 6.8% on a constant currency basis. These results were led by double-digit growth from our Instruments business and high-single digit growth in endoscopy. Medical had low-single digit growth in the period. Our Instruments division \u2013 keep I mind also now has the Neptune product back on the market after receiving FDA clearance and should ramp up nicely as we move through the year. Remember we were not able to sell Neptune capital last year. International sales were strong, up 7.1% in constant currency, driven by our larger OUS division Endoscopy and Instruments.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of our sales and delivered another strong quarter. Sales growth increased 5.9% as reported and 7% on a constant currency basis. Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology businesses and IVS, which grew solid double-digit in constant currency. Spinal implant sales were down low single-digits.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2014 were 66.9% compared to 67.5% in the same period last year. Foreign exchange rates and price had a negative impact on the rate this quarter as we felt the full impact of the weaker Japanese yen and Australian dollar. If they stay at current level the year-over-year impacts from FX will begin to lessen as we move through at least to the back half of this year.", "Research and development expenses increased to 6.5% of sales versus 5.9% of sales last year in the quarter. This is a 16.3% increase in R&D spending over last year and it also reflects our commitment to invest in areas which we believe will help us deliver above market sales growth.", "Selling, general and administrative costs represented 52.3% of sales in the first quarter, and this included approximately $340 million of cost related to the Rejuvenate, and Recall matters.", "On an adjusted basis, SG&A expenses were $836 million or 36.3% of sales in the first quarter of 2014 versus 37.2% in the prior year's first quarter. Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 24.1% in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 24.4% in the first quarter of 2013.", "The rate was negatively impacted primarily by pricing and foreign exchange rates in the quarter partially offset by operational improvement and also from lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percent of sales.", "Other expense on an adjusted basis in the first quarter was $23.7 million compared to $10.8 million in the first quarter of last year. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher interest expense and foreign exchange transaction losses in the period.", "Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 34.5% while the adjusted effective tax rate was 24.1% for the first quarter. This compares to a 20.3% adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter last year.", "As we move into 2014, we expect the full year rate will run closer to 23% with a higher rate in the first half. Remember, an extra year of tax benefit resulting from the renewal of tax extenders were included in the first quarter of 2013 and tax extenders has not yet been approved for 2014, so no benefit for them was included in the first quarter.", "While our 2014 guidance anticipates renewal of the tax extenders, they have not yet been approved by Congress and renewal and timing of them is still uncertain and it\u2019s negatively impact our tax rate early in the year. We also anticipate tax benefits from the reorganization and move of our European headquarters to the Netherlands. However, this is not expected to be in place until the second half of the year, so no favorable impacts will be included in our tax rate until later this year.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash and marketable securities consistent with our 2013 year-end level. We also had $3 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the first quarter at 56 days or two days better than the end of the first quarter last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 175, which was an 8-day increase compared to 167-day in the first quarter last year and inventory levels increased in the quarter primarily in support of a Japanese ERP implementation.", "Turning to cash flow. Our cash from operations were $206 million compared to $236 million in the prior year. First quarter cash flow was lower as inventory increased in the period including amount to support an ERP implementation in Japan and our capital expenditures in the quarter were $70 million compared to $49 million last year in the same period.", "We still have nearly $700 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization. However no shares were purchased in the first quarter as we focused on close the new acquisitions in the period.", "As Kevin mentioned, our 2014 guidance remains unchanged with organic sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 6% and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $4.90.", "To assist you in your modeling, particularly as it relates to the first half, we would note that current foreign exchange rates are resulting in additional headwinds with the total year impact expected to be approximately $0.10 per share with the majority of the impact in the first half of the year.", "Also as mentioned previously the renewal of the tax extenders remain in our guidance, however we now do not expect them to be renewed until later this year.", "Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Good afternoon. Hey, Kevin. Kevin, just starting off with Recon, I think, all quarter long we talked about the impact of various forces here in the first quarter and you talked about many of them.", "It's challenging to quantify weather, but you tried to do so in thinking about selling days versus the weather. If you could just give us some more granularity on, in your mind what was weather? What was seasonality? And why you're more confident that these trends begin to improve here in the second and third quarter?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "David, what I say around seasonality, that\u2019s something that we expected. It\u2019s obviously a trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years and that played out again this quarter. The weather clearly was not expected and it was obviously an unusual period. We expect that those procedures will get done over the course of the year.", "They will be rescheduled. So for the full year we don\u2019t expect that to have a meaningful impact on our volumes. Now obviously, MAKO was a different issue and separate from weather and seasonality where we had the first quarter of integration and obviously we had sales forces on both sides at MAKO and Stryker trying to feel each other out and understand how we they are going to work together.", "We\u2019ve spent the first quarter working through those plans and obviously that did affect the first quarter for MAKO but we are very excited we have our plans in place. We have a unified sales force ready to hit the ground. But to actually parse seasonality versus weather is not something not I could really do either.", "David Lewis \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "", "Okay and then maybe kind of a follow-up on the MAKO commentary you just gave. Can you give us a sense of now that the integration has been done, what does the MAKO distribution force look like in terms of dedicated reps, the capital sales force, and we'd love to get obviously some information about how MAKO grew this quarter.", "If you're not willing to do that, can you give us any sense of when you can get the MAKO business back to the type of growth rates we were seeing in the earlier part of last year? Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So, as we\u2019ve already indicated, we are going to report in these MAKO knee numbers with knees, the MAKO hip numbers with hips and the capital will be part of our other reconstructive segment. We have our full scales force now will be selling the implants combining the MAKO implant sales force as well as the Stryker Orthopedic sales force and that\u2019s new starting in April. We also have separate reps that will be selling capital.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Hi, (inaudible) if you could just quantify the impact of just reclassifying some of the Sports Medicine business into endoscopy, and just maybe talk a little bit more broadly about your strategy going forward in that line?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Sure, Kristen. The sales of Sports Medicine implants was roughly $15 million for the quarter. It was a small but very fast-growing business which we had separate from our endoscopy division. Our endoscopy division does sell many products into the Sports Medicine specialty.", "We have now emerged those two together and have one combined offense from Sports Medicine and we renamed the business unit Sports Medicine which is not part of the endoscopy franchise.", "We are really excited about being able to be built now a strong fast-growing sports medicine implant business and now combining with our existing arthroscopy business.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Okay and then I guess, just looking ahead is the plan I guess to just grow that business more organically or grow it through supplementing through M&A?", "Katherine Owen", "", "Kristen we did the Pivot acquisition and that is going to be within the Endoscopy division. So that really rounded out a key gap. In Sports Medicine we are pretty well positioned in knees and in shoulders, but having a product to treat hip arthroscopy with the gap and we were obviously very impressed by the Pivot offering.", "So, I would say right now the focus on that acquisition which just recently closed. Clearly, endoscopy has a much larger sales marketing and depth and breadth that will be able to hopefully leverage as part of the Sports Medicine strategy going forward.", "Operator", "", "And your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Thanks, can you hear me okay.", "Katherine Owen", "", "Hi, Bob.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Hi, Bob.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Great, good afternoon. First question for Bill, are you still comfortable suggesting that about 45% of the total year's earnings will come in the first half? And I was curious in Q1 if earnings came in where you thought because obviously it was a little lower than what the street was predicting.", "William Jellison", "", "Sure, I\u2019d say that, I mean, roughly we are still comfortable with that. But keep in mind that there was a couple of caveats that I talked about which FX is impacting at the little bit more upfront than we expected moving into the year. And also the tax extenders that we talked about as well too.", "We are originally in pretty much for the full year on a more of an equal basis. It\u2019s still uncertain obviously when those will be renewed at this time, but that\u2019s also an impact that\u2019s affecting the first half of the year.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. So, couple incremental things to consider around that 45% it sound like. And then the second question I wanted to ask which was back on hips and knees and your comment you think things will accelerate over the year.", "I was wondering if you're already starting to see evidence of those surgeries rescheduled and things back to normal. And Kevin, maybe what your assumption is for the hip and knee market growth rate for 2014?", "Katherine Owen", "", "Bob, I\u2019ll jump in with couple of things, going back to your prior question, keep in mind we clearly did not have any visibility when we thought about the first quarter as to how should be the weather would be and obviously it had an impact and still talked about FX that also worst.", "So there were some incremental negatives. In terms of the surgeries I think what we would say is not really going to comment where we are right now early on in the second quarter, surgeries get rescheduled but they tend not to get rescheduled all in the same quarter that they were canceled, particularly if a division has a backlog in place.", "So, that\u2019s why we said we feel comfortable that those surgeries will get replaced or rescheduled over the course of the year for all the obvious reasons for these diseases. We generated these patients are going to suddenly feel better. So it will work itself out over the course of the year.", "We still continue to assume the reconstructive market growth somewhere in the mid single-digits and whether that\u2019s three to four, three to five, something in that vicinity. So there has been no discernable change in the underlying trends with the note of exception that seasonality continues to get more pronounced each year and based on the fourth quarter.", "First quarter, we anticipate the same trend will take place as we look ahead to the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2015.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Just to (Inaudible)", "Kevin Lobo", "", "You broke up a little bit there.", "Operator", "", "Bob are you still there?", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Should be willing to say whether or not that's a new number for that 45%, I mean, you give us that previously, are you willing to say what the best estimate is for the first half of the year in terms of percentage of earnings giving all these considerations that you just suggested?", "Katherine Owen", "", "As we said previously, we still assume approximately 45% of earnings during the first half of the year based on the range of estimates we have for the full year and then, I think Bill outlined in his comments, some incremental headwinds that are specific to the first half and Q2 that are worth looking at when you think about modeling.", "Bob Hopkins \u2013 BofA Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "And your next call comes from Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Thanks. Bill, how big is the SG&A line? I think about the acquisitions you've made and MAKO was $20 million of the quarter on SG&A itself. So I am trying to reconcile with the addition of MAKO and recognizing that the efforts you're taking there, they don't happen day one. How does SG&A come in as well as it did?", "William Jellison", "", "Yes, so I think that there are couple comments there. So, keep in mind on the R&D increase that we had a piece of that is obviously from some of the acquisitions that we\u2019ve been bringing on board, especially as it relates to a percent of sales of R&D to our total sales and then as it relates to the broader based SG&A side, I think that, you should assume that there were some reductions actually in each of those areas. So selling costs were down slightly as well as a couple of the key categories within the G&A area.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "And is that sustainable? This is you know that\u2019s one-time?", "William Jellison", "", "And I think that is probably reasonable to assume that the R&D side should expect to run probably higher than it did last year, pretty much throughout this year and I think the reverse is probably also true with the SG&A broader category.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "And there is nothing that's been re-categorized that's been added SG&A in some other category?", "William Jellison", "", "No reclassifications in place.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Okay, and then lastly on the disclosure that you're backing out from costs pertaining to the Neptune recall, can you be clear what those are?", "William Jellison", "", "Are you talking for this quarter? There were no additional Neptune recall costs in this quarter. You broke up a little bit on your question. Is that what you are referring to?", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Yes, are you guys still there?", "William Jellison", "", "Yes.", "Katherine Owen", "", "Yes, hi, Mike there is a little trouble hearing you and specific to the last question, was it around the Neptune recall charges in the quarter?", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Yes, I am just trying to make sure that we've got the reconciliation because in your move from GAAP to adjusted, it says that you are adjusting for costs relative to both Rejuvenate, which we understand obviously and it lists as well the Neptune recall and I wasn't clear why you'd have expenses related to that recall that you are backing out, but it sounds like Bill is saying there were no expenses.", "William Jellison", "", "That\u2019s correct. There were no recall expenses for Neptune in this quarter. The recall cost that you are seeing there were related to just the Rejuvenate matter.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Perfect, okay. Thank you, guys.", "William Jellison", "", "That kind of market as well as and we would expect that business to continue to ramp as we move through this year.", "Mike Weinstein \u2013 JPMorgan", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "William Jellison", "", "You bet,", "Operator", "", "And your next call comes from Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "", "Richard Newitter \u2013 Leerink Partners", "", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Kevin, can I just ask you to elaborate a bit on your comments on the dynamics playing out in the EU Recon division and what gives you confidence? I think you said acceleration throughout the year in 2014?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So, as you know, Europe was a sour spot to go back about a year-and-a-half for Stryker and it has been over a number of quarters trailing the market and we launched our turnaround and we\u2019ve now had four straight quarters of low single-digit growth. So it\u2019s sustained.", "We started off with Northern Europe being the area of primary focus and now I would include Southern Europe in that. So, Spain sort of performing well at the end of last year and in this first quarter, even Italy registered positive results and Italy have been a country where we were suffering the most.", "So I would say our recovery has been broad based across all the countries back to basics. We really have our management team performing very well. So it\u2019s sustainable four quarters in a row in a market that\u2019s still challenging market overall. We are performing well and obviously for Stryker, Reconstructive is the biggest segments in Europe and so, the implant business is starting to get healthy again.", "Richard Newitter \u2013 Leerink Partners", "", "Great, and then just \u2013 with respect to the comment you were making about rescheduling surgeries in 2Q and beyond, you said that a surgeon's backlog might actually be prohibitive in terms of the surgeon being able to get that patient in.", "That would almost seem to suggest that backlogs seem very healthy at least in your customer base. Can you describe either anecdotally or quantify what you're hearing from your customers about expanding backlogs, if any and does that leave you feeling better than perhaps a few months ago looking forward into the year?", "Katherine Owen", "Rich, I\u2019ll take it. I think it\u2019s safe to say obviously reading a little bit too much into my comment it was more around to give perspective that you can\u2019t make up all the surgeries in a given quarter and that maybe one factor. It was intended to imply that there has been a significant change in backlog that\u2019s specific to us.", "It\u2019s really just the factors to why we said and think those procedure volumes will be rescheduled over the course of the year and that I would go back, we are continuing to assume the Reconstructive market is essentially unchanged in terms of its growth with the noted commentary around seasonality.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. So, going to your organic knee growth, I guess, our calculations suggest that in the US at least, excluding MAKO, your organic knee growth was flat to even perhaps down a little bit negative? Was this a surprise to you?", "Is that calculation in the ballpark? And if so then that would imply a pretty substantial reacceleration through the back half of the year. Is that fair?", "Katherine Owen", "Derrick, I\u2019ll take that question and for consistency sake we have said we are not going to breakout MAKO revenue and I know it cause us some challenges but I have to note you guys have your models and we\u2019ll get some approximation in there.", "We very clearly saw some impact as we talked about on weather and seasonality in the quarter and clearly Q1 versus Q4 growth is there is a big change and we assume that trend will continue this quarter. So those are some of the factors that you should assume. This isn\u2019t a linear trend as it relates to our businesses both in recon as well as some of our capital businesses.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "", "Okay.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Yes, specifically related to knees, what I\u2019d say is all of last year we grew at market rates in knees and so I wouldn\u2019t expect anything really different going into this year in terms of outside of MAKO if you just look at our core knee implants that we perform around market rates and we don\u2019t see a different dynamic necessarily playing.", "Derrick Sung \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "", "Okay, thanks and can you spend a couple minutes on pricing, both what sort of the level of price cuts that were seen from Japan versus your expectations? And also it does look like on Recon pricing has gotten sort of sequentially worse over the last three quarters. What's going on there, if anything? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "I\u2019ll take the recon comment and we don\u2019t break out pricing by specific product lines or hips and knees in our financials you can get the pricing impacts. We continue \u2013 for the three main businesses, we continue to see pricing pressure partly offset by mix and the total company price continues to be down at the 1.5% to 2% range.", "William Jellison", "", "And Japan price cuts, obviously we expected those price cuts and they came in line with our expectations. And specifically for reconstructive, we do break out pricing by segment, the first quarter price reduction was not very different, if you look at our full year price reduction, it\u2019s in line with our full year price reduction.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Matthew Dodds with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "", "Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Hi, good afternoon, just a couple of quick ones. First, Katherine, just, on the acquisitions, is the right math two months of Trauson in the quarter and then a full quarter of MAKO, there is the only two that have an impact?", "Katherine Owen", "", "Well, we also closed on Pivot, but we didn\u2019t break out that revenues but it was, but I think it\u2019s safe to say very immaterial particularly given when it closed in the quarter and then Berchtold closed after the first quarter. So, yes that\u2019s potentially the bulk of it.", "", "Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Okay and then \u2013 and Kevin for you on trauma in the US, not everybody's reported but the big companies have. It looks like the market doubled. So almost 10% this quarter. Is your sense that that was weather-related or do you see a strengthening in the market overall?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Yes, so first of all, not everybody has reported yet. And I\u2019d say, you do have the impact of the recall, the competitor recall from last year which inflated that competitor\u2019s first quarter and frankly damped down our growth rates, so our real underlying growth rate was even higher than the 12% we reported.", "Weather did does have a factor. It\u2019s not nearly as \u2013 it\u2019s not a one-for-one with sort of the slow down you see in hips and knees, there is not a one-for-one replacement trauma, but, yes, the weather does have an impact and was a tailwind for us for the market in the first quarter.", "Matthew Dodds \u2013 Citigroup", "", "Thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Katherine.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Hey, thanks. Just one \u2013 a couple points to clarify, just I'd love to understand you mentioned some of the factors impacting the MAKO business as you got further along in the integration or really began your first quarter of integration. Could you \u2013 I wasn't sure if I understood whether this was hesitation among the sales force as they the typical sort of who gets what territory kind of questions.", "Whether there was some loss of sales force in that process or whether there was hesitation or sort of on the customer utilization side, if you could maybe add a little color there? And then I have one follow-up.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So to the points you made, I would say yes, hesitancy on the sales force around who is going to get paid, who is going to get credit, what territory am I going to cover and yes on the hesitancies around customers saying well not the Stryker ones evolve should I buy this or should I wait, can I get financing, or are they going to sell this differently.", "So the hesitancies is yes, on both two parts. The one area where we did not have an issue was on sales force loss. We did not lose any sales force, our sales forces has all been retained, but there was this limbo where you are trying to figure out and sort out who is going to be credit for what.", "Especially, if you look at Stryker Reconstructive implant people who are not getting credits in the first quarter, they obviously were engaged fully until they understood what it meant for them. We were able to clarify that over the course of the first quarter, so they are now fully engaged.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Great and then this reacceleration, if you could, Katherine, maybe would be the best person to walk through what the points and drivers are as you see through the rest of the year putting aside what we just talked about what Kevin just mentioned, what are some of the other factors you think that get the growth going again to hit your full-year numbers?", "Katherine Owen", "", "So, if you are talking about \u2013 I assume you talk about top-line?", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co", "", "Yes.", "Katherine Owen", "", "So, keep in mind, our organic growth in the quarter was 5% and so I think we are in very good shape recognizing Q1 the biggest factors that\u2019s a negative for revenue is the seasonality both for capital which obviously has stronger fourth quarter trends and then the Reconstructive, which I think is, of course that was pretty well beaten in terms of that seasonality trend.", "As the year unfolds, the benefit we\u2019ll see is the acceleration in MAKO as we talk through. Neptune is ramping up as it just got back on the market. We had to do some customer upgrades in the first quarter. We did several acquisitions that we closed in the first quarter. We\u2019ll start to see those attraction with those as the division start to take advantage of the expanded product offering there and\u2026", "William Jellison", "", "And I\u2019d say, we are going to continue to sustain the kind of double-digit growth in Neurotechnology. Those businesses are all really well positioned with strong momentum, strong pipelines. So we expect that business to continue to perform very well. So we have a number of businesses, Trauma, Instruments division, Neurotechnology, we were very bullish on our performance over the course of the year.", "Katherine Owen", "", "But, I just think as you go back and adjust models, the biggest change that we\u2019ve seen as we talked about it\u2019s gotten greater each quarter or each year, is the seasonality. So obviously that\u2019s going to impact how the fourth quarter of this year looks like just it did impacted the first quarter.", "And then sort of the headwinds that we talked about around FX in particular that will impact the second quarter. So there is just more variability on the overall quarterly trends, but when we step back and look at the full year, it\u2019s very consistent with our expectations.", "Matt Miksic \u2013 Piper Jaffray", "", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Jason Wittes with Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "", "Jason Wittes \u2013 Brean Capital", "", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wonder if you could help us out with timelines on product flow for MAKO, now that it's fully integrated with Stryker, and that is specifically the Total Knee I think you're starting that trial, I think that's still going to be the MAKO knee. I guess how long will that take to get on the market from your expectation, and when would we see integration with other Stryker products within MAKO?", "Katherine Owen", "", "I would refer back to the comments we made in the formal part of the call. We start movement in the first quarter with the Total Knees with MAKO\u2019s Total Knee system and we do anticipate launching the Total Knee on the MAKO robot in 2015. In terms of product iterations and next generations, we are not going to go into any additional color on that.", "Obviously, we do have plans to introduce Stryker implants in both the hip and knee side. The timing of that and the prioritization \u2013 I think that we are working through internally. We will likely be able to share some additional color at our Analyst Meeting in September where the product there is going to focus on the Reconstructive business in MAKO. But beyond that, we are not prepared to go into any more detail around the pipeline.", "Jason Wittes \u2013 Brean Capital", "", "Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "", "Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "Hi, good afternoon. First question is on foot and ankle. Again, another quarter of 30% plus growth. But that's 3X the market, so Kevin, maybe talk about what continues to drive that growth and how sustainable it is? And I had a follow-up on Spine.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Yes, it\u2019s the beauty of the Foot & Ankle business unit. We created this dedicated focused business unit only a couple of years ago. We obviously combine the Memo Metal acquisitions with our existing products and we\u2019ve just been driving market expansion and we are addressing surgeons that weren\u2019t using implants before.", "And so it has been difficult to predict, I would say, at some point the comparables what you think would catch up to you, but we are in a market expansion mode. We are just continuing to drive and gain new procedures with new clinicians. So, it\u2019s a fabulous market.", "We\u2019re very, very well positioned and we continue to outperform the market by a healthy margin. So, there isn\u2019t anything new we are doing, so the playbook that we put in place from the beginning is the playbook that we are following and because it\u2019s a new market, versus having to take share from existing players, the run rate for growth in still very healthy.", "Glenn Novarro \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "", "And then my follow-up on Spine, I think you said in your prepared comments that implants were down low-single digits. Can you break that out between US and OUS? And was that down low-single digits in line with the market?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Yes, I would say that we \u2013 our performance if you look over last year we performed kind of inline with the market, at least with some large players. I would say that held true again in the first quarter or you have the U.S. down low single-digits, OUS, up low single-digits, that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s been playing out over the course of last year and the first quarter was no different.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Matthew Taylor with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "", "Matthew Taylor \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to understand how you are thinking about the combined business now that you've linked the sales forces and are aligned there. Is that, I guess, like flipping a light switch do you think or does it takes some time now for them to regain momentum?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Well, it\u2019s just like any other integration. So it\u2019s going to depend. I can\u2019t give you a straight answer, but what I can tell you is the teams are very engaged and they are very excited, but it\u2019s new and you have people that are collaborating together, you have that certain relationships are well established, but it\u2019s not something that I can \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be linear and it\u2019s something that will build and grow and accelerate throughout the course of the year.", "Matthew Taylor \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "Okay and then just on the weather, were your comments on surgeries more related to any one segment, or is it more Recon focused or did you see it more broadly across your business is?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "No, certainly they are recon focused. If you look at our MedSurg business posted very, very good results, our Neurotechnology division posted very, very solid results. So it really was localized to the Recon business. And Spine to degree, but it\u2019s not that different than last year.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from David Roman with Goldman Sachs . Please go ahead.", "", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "Hi, good evening. I wanted to ask just one follow-up question on the insurance business, I had thought that as part of the Neptune upgrade that you were going to place those systems with customers, so I'm just wondering about the 13% growth in the quarter whether you are in fact selling that again and how we should think about the actual revenue trajectory to the balance of the year?", "Katherine Owen", "", "So what we talked about, that\u2019s probably going to take until the third quarter in this year so we are really at a fully run rate because we did have to go back to existing customers and do a software upgrade for them. But we are also now selling, and we are selling disposables associated with that.", "So the comment still hold, I would say the teams are very excited obviously to have the product back on the market, given the features and benefits and we would expect that momentum to accelerate again into the third quarter where it should be truly reflective of them hitting on all cylinders.", "David Roman \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "", "That's helpful. And then, maybe just a broader question for Kevin and Bill. As you think about the long-term earnings growth of the business, how should we think about the rubric to the P&L?", "Just looking at the performance the past couple quarters, it seems to me as though if I look at the drivers you have the top-line growing at a pretty consistent solid rate, gross margins are coming down.", "There might be some discrete factors there but it sounds like you're going to run really hard to try to keep them flattish at best. You can manage discretionary spending and then you can try to get some financial leverage to grow earnings.", "Is that the right way to think about how you grow earnings in this business now in an environment where pricing looks like a persistent headwind?", "William Jellison", "", "Sure, I think that \u2013 I mean, those are generally reasonable comments, but maybe the one exception on the gross margin related rate. Keep in mind that both in the first quarter of this year and also throughout all months all the quarters last year, we took a pretty heavy headwind from FX in each of those periods and a large part of that has impacted at the gross margin level.", "So, if FX was even neutral, I think that headwind on the gross margin rate would be much reduced and despite the fact that we\u2019ve got some significant pricing headwinds in general, I think that we\u2019ve got some good initiatives to our broader based GQO team itself reduce those operating related costs in the gross margin area to help offset that.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "", "Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo", "", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, could you talk a little bit about the outlook for the medical division in the US, and the US capital equipment market in general now that the ACA has been in place for four months this year? Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So, you saw our Medical division in the U.S. grew in low single-digits and it has had pretty steady performance. We are not seeing any discernable change in the capital equipment market. The same challenging market that we had all of last year, the ACA impact is negligible capital is still challenging, but our division is continuing to perform well in a challenging market.", "Larry Biegelsen \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "", "And then on emerging markets, could you just talk about what percent of your sales now are emerging markets, the growth in the quarter, and how much the knee issue in Asia impacted your growth? Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So, yes, as we mentioned in previous calls, the smaller market Asian companies, the distributor change that we\u2019ve gone through has lingered and that primarily in knee business.", "So that did impact us. Our emerging market as a total percent of sales is around 7% and we are having very strong growth as we mentioned in China as well as India.", "We still have a lot of work to do in some countries like Russia and Turkey where we are really starting from a small foundation. I am excited about the potential for emerging markets specifically with Trauson which performed very well in China and which we will start to launch in countries outside of China over the course of this year.", "Operator", "", "And your next call comes from Matthew O'Brien with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "", "Matthew O'Brien \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just quickly on MAKO with the clinical trial that you're enrolling right now, I'm looking at the website right now and it seems reasonable that it will probably take a couple quarters to enroll.", "And then I think it says here about a one-year follow-up. So we shouldn't expect that rollout to come before that trial is complete. Is that a fair way to characterize it?", "Katherine Owen", "", "So we are going to complete the trial. We haven\u2019t given a timing on submission but clearly it\u2019s going to have to happen to be consistent with our goal of launching our Total Knee system in 2015. So we are enrolling, we have not gone into detail probably for competitive reasons regarding the trial design and some of the specifics. But it\u2019s all consistent with our goal of launching in 2015.", "Matthew O'Brien \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Okay, but it seems reasonable that it would probably be later next year rather than earlier?", "Katherine Owen", "", "2015. So I would say\u2026", "William Jellison", "", "I would say just hold for now and over the course of this year we will be able to provide more color. It\u2019s just too early for us to comment at this point in time.", "Matthew O'Brien \u2013 William Blair & Company", "", "Okay, thank you. And just real \u2013 one more real quick one for Kevin, since you've got there, you got into that position, you've done a real nice job of building out your presence in some of the faster growth areas of orthopedics and you've done the Pivot acquisition now and your commentary there was interesting to me given how large that market is, and the growth opportunity that you have there.", "Should we think of Sports Med as the next focus area in ortho for Stryker? A big ramp up in sales and marketing presence there as a bigger chunk of R&D spend heading into that market?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So, we have a number of fast-growing segments within Stryker and I would say Sports Medicine is one of those fast-growing segments, trauma is a fast-growing segment. We have fast-growing segments in Neurotech, we mentioned Interventional Spine is a fast-growing.", "So many business units that are fast-growing. I wouldn\u2019t want to isolate it to one or two or three and we believe that the combination of the fast-growing sports medicine implants where we had strong knee, strong shoulder and now very strong best-in-class hip arthroscopy products which that we acquired through Pivot combined with the endo arthroscopy business will give that a shot in arm.", "So, yes, I would say Sports Medicine is a focus area, but it\u2019s not different than it has been in the past. We are just going to bring a bit more muscle to it by combining the two organizations together. We think we are very well positioned. We have a number of new launches coming out of the arthroscopy unit that will combine with the Sports Medicine business.", "So we think the timing is perfect to bring these businesses together. But I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s something different than we were doing before in terms of focusing, we were focused on Sports Medicine.", "We just didn\u2019t have still in the implant side, so we carved out a separate group, did a lot of internal development, have now combined that with Pivot, so we now have really a great offering on the implant side that we can combine. So, three or four years, we weren\u2019t ready to really compete vigorously in Sports Medicine, because we didn\u2019t have a complete offering, but we are now ready.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Thank you so much for taking the questions. A big picture one and a detailed one, big picture, one of the things that you focused on when you first joined, Kevin is, what was happening in Europe. Can you give us an update on what that looks like? And then my more specific question is, is there any update on the timing for the reintroduction of OtisMed in the United States? Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So on the first question, I take the first part of the question on Europe, I would say, we just had sustained strong performance. I had mentioned before four straight quarters of positive growth in constant currency in the low single-digit area. It\u2019s taken a number of quarters to get that in all countries.", "I mentioned last year that we were lagging in Italy. We have been lagging in Spain that story in Spain has changed over the last six months and this quarter was the first positive we saw in Italy which had been the country where we were suffering the most over the last two years.", "So, the business model that we put in place for the turnaround is working and working well and we are now sustaining that performance in Europe, as we mentioned before in detail how we have changed our commercial model, we are very pleased with how that commercial model is working. And so, beyond that I could just say that that the team is stable and performing at a high level.", "Katherine Owen", "", "And Joanne, on the OtisMed, unfortunately we\u2019ve proven that we have done a great job of predicting when we are going to get that back to the FDA. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve gotten good visibility right now in terms of a re-launch. I wouldn\u2019t be assuming necessarily anything in the next few quarters.", "Joanne Wuensch \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Dave Turkaly with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "Dave Turkaly \u2013 JMP Securities", "", "Thanks. Did you say you're going to launch another Total Knee in 2015 in addition to the MAKO one?", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Not an addition.", "Katherine Owen", "", "The trial is being done with the MAKO robot and they had obviously releasing their MAKO Knee when they were putting this together. So that's what\u2019s the news that it\u2019s in the trial right now and we anticipate launching in 2015. The Total Knee and the MAKO robot assisted system with the MAKO Knee in the trial.", "Dave Turkaly \u2013 JMP Securities", "", "Okay. Thanks. And then in terms of the follow-up in the fast-growing segment, it seems like there are some smaller players out there in the world of spine just like some unique assets there that are growing at a pretty good clip and given your performance there, I was wondering if you have any thoughts of incremental R&D to mimic some of that maybe minimally invasive technology or M&A spend there in the future? Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "Yes, clearly minimal invasive is the fastest growing segment in Spine. It is a focus area for us certainly with our internal R&D organization and we\u2019d certainly be open for looking at acquisitions within Spine. We did a very small acquisition.", "We did CoAlign in the first quarter and that\u2019s an acquisition that our Spine team is very excited about. So you should continue to expect that we will launch products internally as well as pursue acquisitions in that space.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Bill Plovanic with Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.", "", "Bill Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity", "", "Hey, thanks. Good evening and thanks for taking my question, Just this is for Bill. On FX, when did you start to hedge? Does this start to turning positive, It\u2019s been a headwind, does it start turning to a tailwind for you at any point in time?", "William Jellison", "", "Right now, if you take a look at kind of the roughly the $0.10 per share impact that I referred to. In the first quarter we referenced it was about $0.05 that was probably the biggest related impact for the year, I think the second quarter will also be \u2013 maybe not quite that level but still at fairly significant level.", "As you move into the third quarter, there may be little bit of an impact yet in the fourth quarter, should be more at least balanced off based on where rates are today. If rates move, obviously that\u2019s an impact that needs to separately be taken into account.", "From a hedging perspective, we did begin to \u2013 we see some benefits from the hedging program already in the first quarter here. As we move through this year, it takes us I think we stated, kind of in the early part of next year until the hedging program is more fully in place but based on current FX rates that we see the impact should be pretty much more neutralized by the time we get into the fourth quarter.", "Bill Plovanic \u2013 Canaccord Genuity", "", "And then once it's fully in place, does it become that there is \u2013 we shouldn't see any EPS impact from the hedging?", "William Jellison", "", "No, I mean, absolutely not. The hedging program is meant to really mitigate what that risk is, so it just buffers it in comparison. At some point unless rates reverse from a different level, right, you still have the positive or negative impact of that. The hedging only just spreads out what the rate is that you are actually paying within a specific quarter.", "And if you think about it, just think about kind of over, kind of a six quarter basis, that\u2019s kind of where we are purchasing the different components of our FX exposure. So, it\u2019s the average that go into that six quarter basis as we move out into kind of the beginning part of the next year that we should be looking at.", "Operator", "", "Your next call comes from Bill Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Hi, I just want to take a follow-up, just on the other expense line item, can you break it out between interest and other and whether or not that was materially off from your expectations?", "William Jellison", "", "So, I\u2019d say that, most of that was kind of inline, a little bit of that was actually from part of our FX exposure that we just talked about the $0.05 that hit us in the quarter. Probably a good penny of that ran through that category. So, that was probably the one area that was not expected because the transaction impact in that category generally, if rates don\u2019t move from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter, there is typically no FX impact in that expense line.", "But as far as the increase in the interest expense side, keep in mind, we place some debt at the beginning part of last year and so the first quarter on a comparable basis now reflects that interest expense in the first quarter as well through and obviously that was planned.", "Kristen Stewart \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "", "Right and then just relative to the share repurchase you mentioned there was $700 million outstanding. How should we think about your guys' approach to whether that will be completed during the year or is it still kind of subject to some acquisition activity?", "Katherine Owen", "", "It\u2019s always going to be subject to acquisition activity because as we stated, we\u2019ve got three primary uses, but first and foremost is the acquisition, dividends are second and obviously fairly consistent in terms of how those play out and interest that we purchased it is going to be the most variable, I would say that in those years we have finished the year with still shares available under the authorization.", "But that you should anticipate in any given year that there will be some level of buyback activity. Clearly in the first quarter, we had a lot of acquisition activity that was the primary use of cash.", "Operator", "", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "", "So, thank you all for joining our call.

My name is Adrian and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release, that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, President and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Stryker's third quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on our M&A activity. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly reports, before turning it to Q&A.", "Our top line performance strengthened in Q3, with organic revenue growth of 8%, which did include the benefit from one extra selling day, that contributed roughly 1%. These results reflect solid year-over-year growth for all three business segments; Reconstructive, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine, while also being balanced geographically.", "Within Reconstructive, trauma and extremities continued its lengthy string of double digit increases and U.S. hip implants were also a standout. MedSurg's impressive gains in instruments were bolstered by acceleration in Neptune sales, and in medical we are seeing early signs of a strengthening in the CapEx environment.", "Our Neurotechnology and Spine Group reported double digit growth in the neuro businesses, partly offset by lower growth in spinal implants. From a geographic perspective, both the U.S. and international delivered high single digit year-over-year organic growth. Europe continues to gain traction, and our strong performance in emerging markets reinforces our view of this segment's long term potential to contribute meaningfully to our growth goals.", "Overall, the strength of our diverse revenue base, enabled us to offset some challenges and achieve impressive growth. As Katherine will discuss, we are working to drive greater momentum with MAKO, and while sales are pacing below our target, the pipeline development is encouraging as is our clinical progress.", "Gross margin was similar to Q2, as we are seeing the impact of a modestly tougher pricing environment, coupled with the negative effect of mix with existing products and acquisitions.", "Shifting to SG&A, our focus on reducing costs is evident, as we continue to drive this down as a percent of sales. We realize additional P&L leverage, as the benefits from our recently opened European Regional Headquarters contributed to a lower tax rate. With the strong pipeline, reduction in operating expenses and the lower tax rate, offset by meaningful investments in R&D, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.15 a share, up 10.6% year-over-year. For the full year, we are confident in our ability to achieve organic sales growth of 5% to 6%. We expect adjusted EPS to come in at the low end of our $4.75 to $4.80 range, owing to the tougher foreign exchange environment that Bill will elaborate on. Also, the creation of our European Headquarters will enable us to repatriate approximately $2 billion of O-U.S. cash over the course of 2015.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on the performance of our recent key acquisitions. Encouragingly, the acquisitions of Trauson, Berchtold and Patient Safety Technology, which we reviewed in detail on our Q2 call, all continue to track with our expectations, while Pivot is running slightly ahead, as we leverage the strength of our considerable endoscopy sales channel.", "Shifting to MAKO, overall we are encouraged by the progress we are making, while recognizing some challenges. Our capital sales are pacing behind our initial targets, but we have made progress each quarter, with a total of eight robots sold in Q3. We are confident that the market for robots is improving, as we have a strong pipeline of deals we are working on closing.", "We expect continued sequential improvement in Q4 and into next year for several reasons. Firstly, we are in the final stages of the integration of the MAKO selling organization into our recon sales force, and the development of sales coordination between the MAKO capital sales reps and our very large recon implant sales force. The first stage was completed in April, as we move the MAKO selling and service organization into our recon division and under recon management and establish near term incentives. We continue to work toward full integration into a single implant and selling organization. Gaining near term sale synergies has proven to be more challenging than we anticipated, but we are encouraged by the recent momentum.", "Secondly, we have developed and are expanding our flexible financing offering that we believe a number of hospitals will find attractive, as we look to leverage our considerable expertise in this area. On the clinical front, we have completed enrolment in our total knee trial and continue to target FDA approval in 2015.", "Turning to SBI, we are very pleased with the early integration, with sales tracking ahead of our initial expectations. We have trained over 100 Stryker reps on the STAR ankle and various products. By the time the training is complete, we will have over 200 reps trained and selling the STAR Ankle and over 400 reps trained in selling SBI's various upper extremity products.", "Its important to note that the STAR Ankle is a fourth generation design with over 28,000 total ankles implanted globally. There are now well over 100 clinical studies on the STAR Ankle, with one of the newest published by Dr. Michael Kaufman [ph], where he reported 94% survivorship at an average of 12.6 years. We believe these favorable long term results are helping to differentiate the STAR Ankle from our competitors, and reinforce the benefits of three-piece mobile bearing technology.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks Katherine. Sales growth was positive by 11.1% in the third quarter, including a negative 0.2% impact from foreign exchange translation. Constant currency sales increased 11.3%, which includes organic growth of 7.8%. We had a positive impact from one more selling day in the quarter, which had a positive impact on growth of approximately 1%.", "Earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the third quarter were $0.16 per share versus $0.27 per share last year, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.15 for the quarter versus $1.04 last year. This quarter's earning per share includes a negative impact of approximately $0.01 per share from foreign exchange due to currency movements later in the quarter. If foreign exchange rates stay on current levels, this year will be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 compared to last year, or approximately $0.04 per share worse than what we anticipated at the end of the second quarter.", "Based on the current volatility of foreign exchange rates, we would expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by roughly $0.10 to $0.12 per share. This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings is being mostly offset by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustment in the quarter relates to tax expense, associated with both the transfer of intellectual property to the Netherlands from some of our other European locations and for planned tax payments associated with approximately $2 billion of cash repatriation associated with this transfer. I will discuss both of these items a little more, when I discuss our tax rate.", "Also in the quarter, we incurred a charge of approximately $25 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II. These charges may increase or decrease over time, as additional facts become available and assumptions more refined. As mentioned in the past, no insurance proceeds, that may potentially be available to cover some of these costs have been included.", "Looking at sales in the third quarter, our organic growth rate of 7.8% was comprised of a positive 10.2% from volume and mix, the highest quarterly growth level since 2008, while price negatively impacted sales by 2.3%. Acquisitions added 3.4% while FX had a negative 0.2% on sales in the quarter.", "Looking at our segments, Reconstructive represented 43% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Reconstructive products were up 8.5% as reported and grew 8.6% constant currency and increased 4.9% organically.", "U.S. Reconstructive sales grew 11.9% in the quarter, Trauma and Extremities once again had another solid quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 15.3% and grew 7.1% internationally, with 30% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business, excluding the impact from the acquisition of SBI, as we continue to have a great success in expanding the market.", "U.S. hips and knees growth in the period was 8.1% and 6.8% and O-U.S. sales were down nearly a percentage point in hips against a 9% comp last year in the quarter, but up 5.3% in knees on a constant currency basis.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 16.3% on an as-reported basis, 16.6% on a constant currency basis, and increased 11.9% organically. These results benefited from the high teen growth in our instruments business, as we continue to quickly regain share, post the late 2013 relaunch of Neptune. However, even excluding Neptune, instruments grew double digits in the quarter. We also had upper teens growth in our endoscopy, driven by recent acquisitions. Medical had a strong quarter with double digit organic growth, as the hospital capital equipment market began picking up. Sustainability Solutions returned to positive growth in the quarter two.", "International sales within MedSurg were also up nearly 20% in the quarter and were up slightly over 20% in constant currency, benefiting mostly from double digit organic growth in each of the instruments, endoscopy, and medical categories. The MedSurg Group should continue to see strong sales growth in the fourth quarter, as Neptune has another quarter of easier comps. Although you should note, there will be one less selling day in the fourth quarter compared to last year.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine which represents 18% of our sales increased 6.5% as reported, 6.9% on a constant currency basis and 6.5% organically. Growth in the segment was led by double digit growth in Neurotechnology businesses and IVS grew high single digit in constant currency, while spinal implant sales increased in the low single digit range.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margin on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2014 were nearly flat sequentially at 66%. This compares to 68.8% in the same period last year. The primary decline in the margin rate in the quarter resulted from both negative product mix and negative price pressures. Our mix was especially negative in this quarter, due to the impact of recent acquisitions and strong sales of our MedSurg products which grew over 16% in the quarter. These products have a lower gross margin rate than the company average.", "Pricing was down 2.3% in the quarter or 30 basis points sequentially. U.S. hips and knee pricing wireless stable versus Q2, wit the decline attributed to spine and trauma products. Pricing pressure remains challenging and is expected to be down approximately 2% for the company moving forward. Margins were also negatively impacted from foreign exchange movements compared to last year.", "Note that we anticipate our margin rate in the fourth quarter to be near the rates we experienced in the fourth quarter last year, which are also more consistent with our current year-to-date gross margin performance.", "Research and development expenses were 6.4% of sales, slightly higher than last year in the quarter, this is a 12.5% increase in R&D spending over last year, primarily reflecting a higher level of R&D spending tied to recent acquisitions.", "Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $851 million or 35.6% of sales in the quarter versus 38% in the prior year period, as we delivered strong sales growth and were able to continue to leverage our overhead and gain traction on driving greater operational efficiencies.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.9% in the third quarter of 2014 compared to 24.4% in the third quarter of 2013. The rate was negatively impacted by lower pricing, acquisition and product mix and foreign exchange rates in the quarter, partially offset by operational improvements and lower selling, general and admin expenses as a percent of sales.", "Other expenses on an adjusted basis in the third quarter were approximately $25 million compared to $13 million last year in the third quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense and these expenses are expected to run at a similar level throughout the rest of the years.", "Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 86.6%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 19.9%. This compares to a 22.4% adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter last year. We expect the full year rate will be approximately 22% consistent with our year-to-date adjusted effective tax rate. Please note that the renewal of the tax extenders is still reflected in our year and earnings forecast, which if approved, will help reduce the fourth quarter tax rate. However if not approved and made effective this year, it will negatively impact our earnings guidance for the full year and the fourth quarter by approximately $0.05 per share. As we mentioned during our second quarter earnings call, we have officially opened our new European headquarters in Amsterdam.", "During the third quarter, we transferred intellectual property from other countries within Europe to the Netherlands and also made decisions to repatriate nearly $2 billion from Europe to the U.S. over the next year. Most of these funds will be transferred to the U.S. in the back half of 2015. These actions triggered a tax expense, which we booked in the third quarter of this year. The cash outflows for payment of this tax will occur between the fourth quarter of this year and the first quarter of 2015. The transfer of the intellectual property provides us more flexibility in managing our operations in the future and aligns the ownership with where our primary European leadership team will be located. This project will also generate some ongoing tax benefits, which as we mentioned previously, are expected to further reduce our overall adjusted operating tax rate in 2015 by approximately two full percentage points. Currently, we are expecting to reinvest approximately half of these savings directly into our business.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the third quarter at 56 or one day better than the end of the third quarter last year. Days in inventory finished the quarter at 182 days, which was a three day reduction compared to 185 days in the third quarter last year.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first nine months of 2014 were $1.1 billion, relatively the same as the first nine months of last year. Capital expenditures were $172 million in the first nine months of the year, compared to $139 million in the same period last year.", "We still have over $500 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization as approximately $100 million of share repurchases were made year-to-date. As Kevin mentioned, our 2014 sales guidance includes organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6%, and adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $4.75 to $4.80. Due to recent FX pressures, we are more comfortable at the low end of that range. Also as mentioned previously, the renewal of the tax extenders remains in our guidance. However, if these are not renewed, it would have a negative impact on our current year guidance of approximately $0.05 per share.", "Thanks for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). And your first question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Thanks for taking the question. So I wanted to talk about really two items. One was the MedSurg performance this morning. I was hoping you could discuss the environment and how you think it evolved in the quarter, both the U.S. and in Europe. And then second Bill, it looks like the gross margin came in lighter than you were baking, maybe a month ago, and I assume part of that is mix, maybe part of it is FX, I was hoping you could tease that out for us a little bit. Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Mike, I will take the first part, in terms of the MedSurg performance, and I am overall, really pleased with what we saw in the quarter. I would say for the higher ticket capital products that are predominantly in our medical business, although to a lesser degree, in endo, we are seeing signs of strengthening. How strong that ends up being tough to tell, because this is really the first quarter where we feel comfortable commenting that it feels that the CapEx environment has strengthened.", "Instruments is really hitting on all cylinders. Clearly, the Neptune relaunch continues to gain traction. But as mentioned, even excluding that, we had solid double digit growth. So its really across the board. Endo really benefited from the acquisition, as we mentioned before, they had challenging year-over-year comparisons. So I think overall, we feel good about the environment, and feel like there has been very strong momentum going into the fourth quarter, which as you know, is typically -- a particularly strong quarter as it relates to CapEx.", "Bill Jellison", "Mike, then on the gross margin rate, as far as our expectation. Actually the margin rates for the quarter came in relatively close to what we were expecting. We were expecting, as I mentioned before that this was going to be our toughest gross margin comp quarter. I'd say that pricing was incrementally a little bit worse than what we expected, so it did have a little bit of additional impact on the rate, but not much in relationship to what we were expecting. We expect it to be relatively close to the rates that we ran at in the second quarter, and as I mentioned, that's pretty consistent with our expectations moving into the fourth quarter this year and as I also mentioned, that should be more in line with kind of the rates that we were running last year in the fourth quarter as well.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "Okay. If I can just ask one follow-up. So Bill, at the analyst meeting, you made some comments just relative to the ability to drive operating leverage in 2015. Can you just, with this quarter now behind you and you have kind of seen what the gross margin progression looks like, is that -- are you still confident in your ability to drive operating leverage next year?", "Bill Jellison", "I think our broader based comments, first just talking about rate improvements in future periods. We generally talk about that over the next few years, but we are absolutely focused on targeting improvements in operating margin rates, not gross margin rates, but operating margin rates on average over time. we did state though however for next year that because of our investments with some of the tax benefits that half of those tax benefits would be actually reinvested directly in our business, and that will also obviously add pressure associated with the rate in that period.", "Kevin Lobo", "So Mike, its Kevin, just to add. So obviously we will give guidance in January, and you should expect to see leveraged earnings. We obviously don't spike out the guidance specifically in every line of our P&L. The last two years on an operational basis, we were able to have gross margin gains over the last couple of years. Clearly, our mix of our business has changed, based on both our acquisitions as well as MedSurg growing, but we do have our GQ&O efforts clearly focused on driving improvement in our comps. But with price now tracking more towards a 2% range, its certainly an area of extreme focus for us. But you will see, when we give our guidance in January, the degree of leverage that we will be delivering in 2015.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Good afternoon. First question, Katherine, just based on some of your comments on MAKO. Just a few things I was wondering you could elaborate on; one was, you talked about sales synergies being a little more challenging than you expected, and then also new financing options for customers, and I guess in light of the CapEx improvement, very curious in terms of what does that mean? Are you experimenting with sort of lease type models, reagent rental type models, so those two dynamic sales and financing options for customers regarding MAKO and then I have one follow-up?", "Katherine Owen", "Okay. So to take the second part, we have offered through our Flex Financial Group financing options, because of the capital components that exists within many of our MedSurg businesses. So we have been in that financing area for a number of years. What we are doing, is expanding that and leveraging that expertise over to the recon side, where the MAKO capital fits, and really helping them work with some of the budget limitations that exists between capital and operating budgets within a hospital. So a variety of different options that we are looking at, but its clearly a skill we have, and something that MAKO couldn't, at their point in their trajectory offer to customers.", "In terms of the integration, I think the most challenging part, and I think its fair to say, we underestimated the complexity of it, but feel very comfortable with the trajectory we are on. Its just integrating a capital salesforce alongside a very large implant salesforce, and going through the necessary training and coordination that has to take place in existing accounts. So its nothing truly unique, its just, it\u2019s a big job to do, given how large our salesforce is. So we are making really good headway, very excited about the pipeline we are seeing and our ability to continue to drive sequential acceleration in robot sales.", "David Lewis - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then Bill, just a question on the balance sheet; obviously with their [indiscernible] event, your balance sheet is going to expand in size here over the next six months. And Stryker is in this interesting position right now, where you basically are the most underlevered company in all large cap med-tech and there is an increasing trend largely to M&A increase that relative rate of leverage. But I am just sort of wondering, given that increase in cash over the short term, which is going to be quite rapid, can you think about the spread between your cash interest and what you can get in the credit markets, that spread is actually pretty narrow. So you start thinking about different level of capital structure that's appropriate for Stryker, given your cash balance is going to expand here rapidly in the next six months?", "Bill Jellison", "Well I think its fair to say that we definitely believe that our balance sheet is very strong across the board and has been. And so we always want to make sure that we are putting the broader based assets that we have to work as efficiently and effectively as we can. I think as Kevin mentioned multiple times, we are absolutely first and foremost focused on acquisitions, but dividends and stock buybacks are also a key part of our overall cash structure strategy.", "Just keep in mind as well too, that as we move forward here, we have been booking and accruing an amount on our Rejuvenate claims, at some point, those will potentially be paid out. So we have to make sure that we are covered for that situation. But also on the cash repatriation side, also keep in mind that as I mentioned, most of that cash won't occur actually until the back half of 2015. But you can be assured that we are actively looking at how to best utilize that cash moving forward.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, congrats. Hear me okay?", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah, hi Kristen.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Okay perfect. Thanks. Sorry about that. I just wanted to ask a question just kind of, if you can give us your broad I guess view on just the overall recon market, and in particular, your performances in Europe or within international markets seems to be improving nicely. Maybe just walk us through I guess, what you are seeing if you're seeing underlying improvement, if you would expect to continue to see improvements going forward sequentially, seasonality, and I think you do have a, one last selling day in the fourth quarter as well, I just wanted to confirm that?", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah. We do have one last selling day in the fourth quarter, and I would say that, it\u2019s a little bit geographic dependent, but clearly the momentum we are seeing in Europe continues, and that's helping that O-U.S. growth, recognizing as we mentioned, we did have some very difficult comps, particularly on the hip side. Japan, with the price cuts have been challenging and also, we have been working through, and largely are past that now, but there were implications tied to the ERP implementation that we talked about previously. But overall, feel pretty good about the environment.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then on the U.S. side, any comments there, in particular?", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah I mean, a little tough, because obviously we don't have all the numbers in yet, but in terms of hips, we feel pretty comfortable that we are growing ahead of the market, even after adjusting for MAKO. These for the past eight quarters, we have kept pace with the market. We may be a little trailing in that this quarter, but we will have to wait and see as everybody else's numbers come in. It does seem like overall, this is a year where the hip market is stronger than the knee market.", "Seasonality, I think you're going to see a similar dynamic recognizing that was exceptionally strong in the fourth quarter last year, so its really difficult to predict if we are going to have that healthy of a seasonality effect. But clearly, Q4 is going to see the benefit of that seasonality.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Turkaly from JMP Securities. Please go ahead.", "David Turkaly - JMP Securities", "Thanks. Just quickly, I think you said that U.S., the knee pricing was stable. Did you guys quantify that in terms of a percent, the pricing impact on those two lines?", "Katherine Owen", "No. What we said was, in the U.S., hip and knee pricing was consistent with what we saw in the second quarter of this year's -- approximately in that mid single digit range.", "David Turkaly - JMP Securities", "So mid single digit range for both?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes.", "David Turkaly - JMP Securities", "And I guess, given the better CapEx environment you guys talked about, I am curious if you guys have any comment on sort of utilization or overall procedural volume or sort of surgeon backlog here. Any thoughts or any updated thoughts on that, post this quarter?", "Katherine Owen", "No. I don't think we have any real insights to offer there. It does seem like the CapEx environment did modestly improve. But again its one quarter, and its tough to know, if that is a trend that's going to be indicative of accelerating unit volume. So overall, feel good about the momentum we are seeing, but we don't really have any insight, as it relates to physician volumes or [indiscernible] and the like.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Hi. Just following to hospital capitals, one follow-up there on strength. You talked about it potentially improving here towards the end of a seasonally strong fourth quarter. You mentioned last year I think Kevin, you had spoken quite a bit about this sort of collaborative approach across to this line, but they are sort of customized flexible financing approach, this contracting with hospitals, based on capital or operating pricing; [indiscernible] capital business lines; what you're seeing in your estimation seasonal and sort of market improvements or to what degree do you think you're taking share because of some of the programs you've put in place? And I have one follow-up.", "Kevin Lobo", "Okay Matt, first of all for the follow-up, if you are on speaker, I'd appreciate if you could just get off the speaker, because we had a little trouble hearing you. But I think I got the gist of the question, and so clearly, we do have a lot of flexible programs, we are collaborating across our divisions. But I would say at this stage of that work, its really more about our teams executing directly with our customers, and we clearly saw a nice performance in medical last quarter, and the second quarter, and that also accelerated very dramatically in the third quarter. So part of it is, the market is improving. We can see conditions in the market improving, and part of it is our execution. Really difficult for me to parse, which one of those two, and when more people report this quarter, we will have a better sense on how much of it is growing with the market, versus how much is taking shares. My sense is, we are probably growing a little faster, but I can't dimensionalize that for you just yet.", "I would say, our collaboration efforts, its still early, we were getting some wins, but I wouldn't attribute the bulk of our success to that. Its really more about our -- our team is really performing well in the market.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Thanks for that. The follow-up maybe for Katherine on MAKO. You had mentioned adjusting for hips, and we certainly have heard more interest on the hip side. As you complete this integration and head into the end of the year, is there something that you can give us that we might view as sort of capital as heading into next year. And to what degree is the hip emerging as sort of an important application whereas maybe a year or two ago, kind of view it as sort of maybe a less interesting opportunity than the knee side?", "Katherine Owen", "So thanks. I think there is a couple of things. I would go back to all the products we highlighted, the Stryker products that we are going to be putting on the robot, targeting for 2015. On the hip side, where they obviously have an indication, and we would agree, we are seeing increasing interest there, and then clearly, our expectation to get approval with triathlon on the robot in 2015. So those are probably the two major triggers.", "Now keep in mind, we are going to have to do training and software upgrades and there is going to be work to be done and make sure this launch is executed in such a way that we can achieve our goals, and that's why we continue to point to -- think about 2016 as the year when we are really going to be on a trajectory where its indicative of us taking meaningful market share gains.", "Kevin Lobo", "What I would add is, Matt, just to add one comment. The hip application, we were certainly excited about it, the software improvements and the last version that was done just prior to our acquisition, and made a big improvement. But surgeons for the most part are pretty happy with our hips, so this requires really a change management with surgeons, to really get to try it and have a good experience and having our implants of course that will help dramatically with that. But we still see the total knee as a much bigger opportunity. There is less overall satisfaction with patients and the perception of improvement we think is far greater than total knee. So there is certainly going to be growth in both areas, but the knee still for us is the biggest opportunity.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies", "Hi. Good afternoon. I wondered if I could just ask on the pricing environment in the United States. One of your competitors earlier this week talked about worsening pricing, particularly on the hip side, and you are talking about a much more stable environment, and just curious if you have any thoughts around why we would be seeing this dichotomy or this diversion in pricing in the market?", "Kevin Lobo", "I think we are actually experiencing some very similar pricing phenomenon, and so the characterization is last year versus this year, or how things are going from quarter-to-quarter this year. So certainly versus the prior year, we are seeing a moderate acceleration in price pressure, or prices have certainly declined. When we characterize it as stable, its really over the course of this year. But when you compare the prior year, certainly, we are seeing an acceleration, and that's why we are now modeling for total company price decrease of roughly 2%.", "Matt Miksic - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, that's helpful. Maybe I could ask one about MAKO as well. I think as you outlined at the analyst meeting, I mean, one of the interesting things about that now for you, is that you seem to broaden the offering in a sense to -- for hospitals in terms of not only offering better potential patient outcomes, but also looking at things like efficiency and infections and other sorts of benefits you might be able to get from the robot? And I guess the question is when we might start to see some of that data, so that you can present the much more compelling case to the hospitals to adopt it?", "Katherine Owen", "I would say that we are obviously continuing to analyze and look at data. I wouldn't point you to anything near term on the data front. I think this is really going to be getting this in the hands of Stryker and other physicians, leveraging the breadth of our product offering and then seeing, just as they did with [indiscernible] the benefits of having the consistency of results, reproducability, better patient experience, all those things that they will get a feel for, as they start to use the robot. I think long term, to think about this becoming more of a standard of care, that's when we are going to have to really look to start to have more clinical data. But I wouldn't point you to anything at the podiums or anything near term.", "Operator", "And we have Matthew O'Brien next with a question. Please proceed.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair", "Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Was hoping we can start on the extremity side of things. Kevin, this is an area that just continues to kind of boggle the mind as far as your growth rates go. I think you are about doubling the market in foot and ankle. Can you just give us a sense of -- is that share coming from some of the larger multinationals that are playing there, or coming from some of the more extremities focused companies at this point? And then with the integration of SBI, is there any reason to think you can't, even though you have more difficult comparisons coming up, grow somewhere around the 30%, maybe mid-20s level going forward?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well certainly, I am not going to speculate on the growth going forward, because certainly, they define my expectations thus far. So when you're entering a new market, its really hard to predict. Obviously, when you're in an existing market, its much more easy to predict what the volume will be. I would say, most of the growth is really coming from expanding the market. We are calling on new surgeons that weren't putting in implants before. That has been really the engine of growth. Obviously, new products that we have been launching as well. The STAR ankle really fills a very important gap in the product portfolio. So we are really excited about that. And frankly we see, in a new market like this, continued opportunity for growth.", "So we are growing the market primarily. We are obviously taking some share as well. But at this point, I think we see robust growth going into the future. But what exactly robust will be, will remain to be seen. But we are extremely pleased with the performance, the dedicated business unit model is working. The certain segmentation that we created is working, and we are very-very pleased with the performance.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair", "Thanks. And as my follow-up, the neuro business which seems to get overlooked here, looks like it improved sequentially here in the third quarter, which historically has not done. Can you talk a little bit about what some of the growth drivers there? It sounds like, I think from last quarter, you mentioned hemorrhagic is the primary growth driver. Is the momentum in that business strengthening at this point?", "Kevin Lobo", "We have three business units within our Neurotechnology business and all three businesses are performing very well. In fact, in this quarter, the neuro-powered instruments was really the strongest growth of the three. But neurovascular, which is really just the coils [ph] for neuro, also grew very-very well, as did our craniomaxillofacial business. That CMF business has been sort of a double digit growth business as well. Growing very well, with custom cranial implants and a number of other new products. So all three business contributing very evenly to the nice double digit performance.", "Matthew O'Brien - William Blair", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "Good afternoon. Kevin and Katherine, to my recollection, minus five or --", "Katherine Owen", "Bruce sorry, can you just speak up a little bit? We are having trouble hearing you.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "Yeah, I am sorry. To my recollection, could you hear me now?", "Kevin Lobo", "Better. But if you can speak loudly please.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "Yes. To my recollection, mid-single digit negative price in hips and knees in the U.S. is kind of at the high end of historical levels. Has there been a secular change and what might be driving that, and is it reversible?", "Katherine Owen", "I would say, what we see -- there is nothing new in terms of the trends, whether its physicians becoming employees of hospitals and greater alignment there or transparency around patient pricing, and also keep in mind, product cycles. Accolade II for example, we got a nice price premium for that, but you do anniversary those from a couple of years into the launch. The product cycles definitely see an impact. So while it has declined, I wouldn't say, we are seeing a step function change. Mid single digits is in the 3% to 5% range. So again, nothing really significantly different, and clearly stable -- and are largely stable through the first three quarters of this year.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "Okay. And my follow-up Kevin is, clearly you guys --", "Kevin Lobo", "Bruce I am losing you. I am sorry Bruce.", "Bruce Nudell - Credit Suisse", "I am sorry. You didn't expect to have Stryker implants on MAKO this year. What is surprising you about the difficulty of MAKO robot placements?", "Katherine Owen", "I think the biggest thing is just the pace of the integration, and we were probably a bit -- we weren't probably, we were overly optimistic on how quickly we could integrate and do all the coordination that's required between the capital reps and our very large Stryker implant reps, and there is a lot of coordination, particularly when you get into individual accounts.", "Certain regions have embraced it, they understand the differences in implant sales versus the CapEx sales and how to partner, and there we are seeing great success and uptick in utilization. But we are only a couple of quarters in and its going to take some time here to really leverage that breadth of combining those two sales forces. So nothing that's significant or really different. It was really just us being overly optimistic about the pace of managing that integration.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah Bruce. The other thing I'd add is, there were certain parts of the country, where some of our customers wanted better use of their robots. So there was a bulk buy that you may have heard about, that HMA had done. CHS bought HMA as a big chain, and they weren't really pleased with the performance of some of their robots. So we actually went about transferring, and went through a big process to actually transfer and move about six or seven robots to [indiscernible] high performing locations. That look a lot of effort on the capital sales team that\u2019s normally focused on selling, to actually shift and transfer. That will pay dividends for us going forward, but its obviously tied up a lot of activity.", "So when you integrate a company, you have to go through these kinds of stumbles I would say. It certainly hasn't taken away any of our enthusiasm. The robot sales force is still intact, and the funnel is really nice and filling up very nicely. So we are excited about being able to continue to improve. But those are some of the stumbles we had to kind of go through. Relationships are everything and building relationships for the big recon sales force is time consuming. And so its below our expectations, but certainly the promise is every bit as exciting as we thought when we did the acquisition.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.", "Glenn Novarro - RBC Capital Markets", "Hi. Good afternoon Two follow-up questions on pricing. One, the mid single digit knee and hips pricing in the U.S., does that include or exclude mix? Or maybe the question should be, are you getting any mix in this environment? And then a question on spine, I think you called that out as pricing getting a little worse. Can you quantify what the spine pricing was, and provide some commentary why the spine pricing got worse? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah. So that is pure price. We are getting some mix, which is partly offsetting that, and that's what we report in a combined volume mix number being north of 10%. So a little bit of price, but it does not fully offset what we are seeing on the overall pure pricing side.", "In terms of spine, pricing there is challenging and that's part of the year-over-year decline in our pricing, to the 2.3% as Bill referenced. Part of it is just the mix of our businesses and greater pressure on certain types of products. But we are managing through that. Really excited about some of the new products and the leadership team that we have got in place there. So we expect to see some improvement going forward, but that's probably the key part that we would highlight.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bill Plovanic from Canaccord. Please go ahead.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity", "Great. Thanks, good evening. So if I could just leverage off of Glenn's question and switch it over to the trauma. You mentioned pricing pressure on trauma. Maybe I have been paying attention, but historically that hasn't been an area that we have seen a lot of pressure, and I am just wondering, if you could give us more granularity on that? Then I have one follow-up.", "Kevin Lobo", "So when we say pressure, its certainly a different type of pressure than you see in hips and knees. So its very low single digit. But trauma has historically been sort of flat. Sometimes we are going to be able to get a little bit in price, but if you look year-over-year, certainly, we did have a bit of single digit decline in price. Low single digit, it\u2019s a change, its nothing dramatic, but obviously if you look at how much market share we have taken over the last few years, and we are starting to get a little bit of pushback from some of our competitors, caused a small amount of price erosion, nothing that's concerning. If you look at the overall growth of our trauma business, it hasn't hampered our growth, and not something that we are overly worried about.", "Bill Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity", "Okay. And then just in terms of SBI, it\u2019s a more specific question, but you closed on the international component of that. I mean what -- Katherine, what type of contribution should we expect from them in the quarter's going forward?", "Katherine Owen", "We haven't broken out the acquisition contribution by the individual pieces. I mean, clearly MAKO is the largest piece and we do have to go through the integration process with SBI. But I think with that group, with the foot and ankle up 30% without it, and then leveraging this product, we would expect a pretty healthy acceleration, obviously continuing to be in that double digit vicinity.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. Good evening guys. Wondered if I could start just one question on the spine side of the business, especially on the implant side, you know that has been kind of bumping along in the U.S. here, plus or minus a couple of points every quarter. We are starting to hear more and more pods or pod participation reversing in that. Any signs of that showing up, it doesn't seem like it in your numbers, but are you hearing anything out in the field along those lines?", "Kevin Lobo", "No, it really hasn't changed. For every pod that goes away and new pods seems to pop up, it seems to be pretty stable overall. The fact that there is some prosecution, will hopefully turn that tide. We haven't seen that trend turn yet. For our business, obviously we had some challenges in the first quarter, we highlighted around some sales force disruptions. We are working our way through those challenges. We are also focused on upgrading our portfolio to have much more MIS products in our mix. Katherine just mentioned, we had spent some time with the spine team this week and very excited about the leadership. We have made some new leadership changes at spine, and exciting portfolio of products that we are going to start to see since the beginning of next year, which will hopefully make us less immune to the kind of price pressure that they have on the core spinal endpoint.", "Jeff Johnson - Robert W. Baird", "Fair enough. Thanks Kevin. And then Bill, just a follow-up question for you; you mentioned the $0.10 to $0.12 kind of incremental hit, or at least a $0.10 to $0.12 hit from currency in 2015 at current rates. Is that incremental to how you're thinking about it, maybe in the second quarter, is all that from the movements just over the past three months, and I know you haven't guided 2015 yet, but would you kind of take a look at our 2015 numbers and whatever we were thinking last quarter, maybe take that dime out at this point, or how should we think about that?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. I think, one of the ways to kind of broadly take a look at that Jeff, that you should always be kind of watching. And it is definitely since the second quarter, in fact its really the changes that occurred really since the middle of August, on the rate side of the equation. So when rates move that much, and rates have generally moved about five to six percentage points across almost all the key currencies, we have got roughly 35% of our business is international. So think of in the kind of 2% range on our total earnings, just from the translation related impact. So that kind of should help kind of guide you to the level of impact that we would see on the overall operations. As we move forward, we don't know where rates are going to be as we move through, in the fourth quarter and into next year, right. So as we get a better look on it, we will obviously be giving better visibility when we give our broader guidance for 2015.", "Kevin Lobo", "Plus we are obviously in the process of working through our budget for next year, and whether we will be able to offset any negative pricing is something we will provide more clarity to, in January.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink. You may proceed.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I could just ask on the capital spending environment. Can you parse out where or what kind of products in the capital equipment domain, within your MedSurg division are -- where you think things are getting better. And is this kind of also applying for bigger ticket items; because it sounded like MAKO, you didn't necessarily have much of a pickup on placing systems, but obviously the lower ticket items within your MedSurg division are -- is that the right characterization?", "Katherine Owen", "No. I would say MAKO is somewhat unique, because yes its capital, but really what we are focused on right now is the integration and the training and driving the coordination between our selling organizations and working with hospitals on the value proposition and the like. That's a little bit insulated or separate right now from the general hospital CapEx trends. I would say, if you look at our medical growth, clearly, very healthy, and that tends to be our larger ticket and more deferrable hospital capital equipment, and we are seeing good momentum and as we mentioned, early signs of an acceleration, recognizing its one quarter. So we will see how the fourth quarter plays out, but we are pretty optimistic about the momentum there. And then if you look at instruments, which has a lower component and a lower ticket CapEx, but still there, clearly whether its Neptune or excluding Neptune, they are seeing very healthy growth, which I think speaks more to the strength of the selling organization and the product portfolio and the value that Neptune brings, less so than a change that we are seeing in the hospital capital environment.", "Richard Newitter - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a quick follow-up on the pricing. I just want to make sure I heard correctly. I think you said spine pricing net of mix was down 10%, is that right? And then two, is there anything specific that you saw in the last kind of three, four, five months, on kind of spine pricing contracts coming out or a big contract coming up?", "Katherine Owen", "No. We didn't quote that number on spine pricing pressure. We are seeing pricing pressure in spine, and that really has to do partly with the product mix and some of the core spine fusion products. So we do think its going to improve going forward. Its clearly one of the contributors to the overall 2.3% pricing pressure we are seeing.", "Kevin Lobo", "As it relates to contracts, they go through different cycles at different periods of time. So there isn't one overall contract that we'd point to. And if you've seen the spine market really, frankly over the last couple of years, a mid single digit decline in prices is what we generally see over a number of quarters.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to come back to the gross margin. And I think the explanation around the trajectory is quite clear on what we have seen thus far. But as you look forward, as you add up the headwinds and tailwinds, at least the way I am thinking about, the headwinds are obviously product mix. In the near term, you have the impact of M&A and then pricing currency. But on the tailwind side, it seems like over time, some of those acquisition headwinds probably abate. You have the GQ&O efforts and then neuro seems to be doing pretty well, as is trauma and extremity. So can we --- what does it take to neutralize some of those forces around the gross margin line and flatten that out on a go forward basis.", "Bill Jellison", "So let me just hit on a couple of the ones that you just talked about. So from an acquisition perspective, absolutely. Acquisitions impacted in a period only, right. Once it anniversaries itself, now its part of our base, and also keep in mind, as we move into the end of the integration of acquisitions, that's actually a piece that helps us improve margin rates over time, because we can ultimately leverage some of the benefits of our broader operations to the GQ&O team to help those acquisitions improve. So its really just the one year, where it wasn't in the base, but its in kind of the current numbers.", "As far as for the product side of the mix, the general product mix, the large part of that is driven really by how strong our equipment growth and instruments growth has been broadly in this quarter. And at 16% this quarter, that was very strong. So I think we are still expecting to see good instrument strength, and MedSurg growth as we move into the fourth quarter, especially since we have not fully anniversaried kind of the relaunch of our Neptune product. But over time, we would think that that balance would be a little bit more in line with some of our historical related averages.", "And then, as it relates to pricing; pricing is incrementally a little bit stronger here, and that is something that our broader based GQ&O team is focused on, knowing that we need to be working hard at our broad based cost improvement initiatives to help offset those types of costs.", "David Roman - Goldman Sachs", "Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up for Kevin or Katherine; as you think about the organic growth rate, at the Analyst Day, kind of one of the things that you tried to stress was the company's ability to sustain an above [indiscernible] growth rate, which obviously, based on the results today you're tracking well ahead of. But if you think, on a going forward basis, whether its in the context of the 5% to 6% that you're offering, what are the factors that lead things to be upside relative to either the current run rate, or what you're targeting here? Is it MAKO -- how much would have to come from the MAKO environment, versus anything you can do on the individual product side or share gain initiative?", "Kevin Lobo", "So we're really obviously a growth oriented company, both in terms of the acquisitions that we pursue, as well as if you look at our R&D spend over the last few years. We are spending at a pretty healthy rate in R&D, and our new product cycle across all the division, which I get a chance to visit and do business reviews, are very exciting. So a combination of both internally developed products, as well as acquisitions, will continue to fuel, what Stryker has really been known for, for years and years and years, which are incredibly strong and talented sales organizations, that can really deliver results. And you're seeing that. You're seeing us perform above the market over quarter after quarter after quarter, and with the pipeline of products coming in and feeding into these really specialized dedicated sales forces, we see this as a sustainable engine for continued strong growth.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "Hi thanks. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes we can. Hi Bob.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "Hi great. Good afternoon. So two things, first on the repatriation opportunity, I think this is an obviously question, but I just want to be clear. So that opportunity is an opportunity to bring cash back to the United States, without paying a tax penalty, correct?", "Kevin Lobo", "So the tax penalty that we are talking about, would be relatively minor, and actually, part of the tax hit that you see in this quarter, include the cost of bringing back those funds. So once we, in essence, make a decision that we are ultimately going to be bringing back funds from O-U.S., which we actually did this quarter, we have to actually book that U.S. tax in our GAAP numbers right upfront once we make that decision, because the specific action associated with, on an expectation of how we are going to utilize that cash.", "So that's already reflected, and we would not expect to book any additional tax charge when we repatriate that, but we would then have the cash outflow of the tax that we have already accrued now.", "Bill Jellison", "So Bob, so obviously the tax charge we have has two components. So it\u2019s a moving of the IP, as well as repatriation. But the repatriation is in the 5% kind of range, its similar to the tax that we paid when we had those holidays to bring back cash, a very-very nominal rate [indiscernible] bring back. If we try to bring back further dollars, then we would have to pay a much higher rate, which is not interesting to us.", "Bob Hopkins - Bank of America", "Okay. I will want to understand the mechanism of that a little better. But I will save that for a later time. The other quick question I wanted to ask was just, back on pricing and the -- I understand the comment about sort of sequentially seeing a stability in the rate of change versus what you've seen over the last couple of quarters. But Kevin as you look forward, just maybe express your confidence that you can maintain relative stability in the level of decline in pricing versus where you're right now, as we again look forward into, not just Q4, but thinking about 2015. I think that's a hot button issue for a lot of investors, and we'd just love to hear reviews on how confident you are, that that can remain stable.", "Kevin Lobo", "Well Bob, obviously I don't have a crystal ball to know exactly what the future is going to hold. I would say there are no new dynamics at play. So these are the same dynamics we have been saying over the last couple of years around physician-hospital alignment, around contracting, the pressure that hospitals are feeling. So its similar dynamics. We are seeing stability over the course of the last couple of quarters. It is a little bit more under pressure than it was in the prior year. But if we saw a new catalyst that would be something that I'd be more worried about. But its really the same catalyst and contracts sort of come and go. There is different cycles that are underway, and as MAKO ramps and as we start to place robots, we really believe that as a fantastic differentiator for us, and something that we will be able -- for Stryker at least, to insulate us from some of the price pressure going forward.", "So that for us is one of the key advantages. But the marketplace hasn't fundamentally changed. There are no new catalysts. If there were, then that would be -- it would create a lot more uncertainty for me, and what we are seeing right now. We are seeing pretty good discipline among the competitive players in the marketplace. So from that standpoint, there will be some consolidation pending in the industry. I think that's also a catalyst for more stability generally, if you look at other industries and what's happening in other industries.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel Nicolaus. Please go ahead.", "Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus", "Hi. Good afternoon everybody. Couple of questions; SG&A clearly going down as a percentage of sales. Trying to understand, where do we go from here? How sustainable is this directionally? Is this is a onetime one year, major stepdown or with [indiscernible] charges are a lot more to come. Just help us think about that, if you would?", "Kevin Lobo", "So on the SG&A side of the equation, we have been averaging about roughly 1.5% of improvement as a percent of sales this year. This last quarter, obviously a little bit stronger again than that. But I'd say, when we can grow at the levels that we just grew at, we can absolutely get additional leverage from our broader based operations, and that's what we are generally driving throughout all the goals and expectations for each of the different divisions. We on top of that, obviously have a number of different cost initiatives to try and make sure that we are focused on taking costs out of the organization, where it makes sense. So I'd say that we made good progress on a number of fronts over the last couple of years, and I'd say that we still believe that there is some good progress yet to be made. So I don't think we talk about an endpoint, but I would say that, if we continually can grow north of kind of the 5% range in general, that we can typically get some good leverage off of that, moving forward.", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah, specifically related to G&A. So on the selling side, we have taken out quite a bit of expense on the selling line this year, and some in the G&A area. But in G&A, we still have significant room for savings, by driving more shared services, where we have just a couple of small pockets in Stryker right now, that have moved to shared services. We have not generalized that across the corporation, and that's something we will be pushing forward in the next couple of years.", "Kevin Lobo", "I just want to emphasize, this European headquarters was a massive undertaking. So you're seeing the side of the benefits related to repatriation of cash and tax improvements. But to actually provide system changes and to remap all of our transactions involved, hundreds of people across our organization over the last year to put this change into effect. So we will see those benefits, but those resources were burning a lot of energy on this project. We are now going to turn their focus and their attention on driving more shared services. And so we see room to continue to drive efficiency and leverage.", "Rick Wise - Stifel Nicolaus", "That's great Kevin. And my follow-up, again I don't know if I should put these in the same sentence, but the $2 billion repatriation and the comment about reinvesting 50% of the tax savings etc, could this potentially help you offset some of the clearly obvious FX headwinds in some way, could you reinvest a smaller amount of the tax savings or be more aggressive. Are these levers we should believe or assume that you're reflecting on as you put together your 2015 plan?", "Kevin Lobo", "There are a lot of dynamics and a lot of variables as we put together a plan. So a lot of what you say will be things that we will think through and will provide clear guidance in January and characterize those elements for you in a very clear manner.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Bill, I wanted to focus on the tax rate. I think you said, if I heard correctly, that you expect it to be down sequentially in Q4, but you still expect to come in at about 22% for the full year, and that the R&D tax credit would be reflected in Q4. I guess, did I hear correctly and that would seem to get you down to about 21%. So maybe if you could help clarify my misunderstanding?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. Yeah, that's a little bit of a misunderstanding there. But we are expecting -- we have got a year-to-date adjusted operating effective tax rate of about 22% so far year-to-date. That's actually the rate that we are expecting for the full year, which would imply that the fourth quarter will be relatively close to that rate. As we move forward though into 2015, we do expect to reduce our average tax rate from 14 to 15 by about two full percentage points. So if we average roughly 22 this year, you should be thinking in the neighborhood of around 20% next year, as you are looking at 2015.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo", "Got it. So that means, if the -- sorry, go ahead.", "Bill Jellison", "Just maybe one other point of clarification which was around the tax extender comment. So the tax extenders are currently in our year end forecast. So if those don't come, then obviously that puts a little bit additional pressure on this year's tax, but hopefully at the end of the day, if it doesn't come this year, we would sure expect it to come next year and may have like a double year benefit, as we did back in 2012.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo", "Got it. That's helpful. And then the Q4 implied guidance, if my math is correct, is 3% to 7%. I understand you have one less selling day in Q4, but is there any reason that you would be towards the low end of the guidance, given the strength and momentum we saw this quarter? Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "Fourth quarter is pretty volatile as we have seen in the past, and certainly capital equipment is a big thrust in the fourth quarter, and is inherently volatile. So based on how we close this quarter, I wouldn't think we'd be expecting to be at the low end of the range. But it\u2019s a range, and there is unknowns that could happen. But we are certainly feeling -- at this point, we are feeling pretty good, but its always inherently volatile.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin Lobo", "We can now Joanne.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "Thanks and good evening. Thanks for taking the question. We have heard on a couple of calls say for about O-U.S. weakness, it has ranged from problem in Europe to problems in the Middle East and other areas. Could you please comment if you are experiencing any of this?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah. So for us it\u2019s a little different given the makeup of our business. So in Europe, we have a smaller business that we have really strengthened over the last couple of years. We had a strong quarter in Europe, again in the third quarter. And so, we may not be indicative of the overall broad market based on our presence. China, we had extremely strong growth, well north of 20%. India was very strong. Now look at all the emerging markets, we were very strong double digit growth. Even if I look at our EMEA, our region had a good performance. So clearly, Russia and Turkey are two areas that are problematic.", "But beyond those two areas, the rest of our international -- and we feel pretty good about our performance, and the markets are holding up well. The challenges that we had in Japan are I would say more Stryker specific challenges, beyond obviously the price cuts, that everyone experienced. We have some of our own challenges. But international for us is a bright spot, and we are feeling -- our organic growth was very strong in Q3, and the overall negatives that I have heard as well, haven't really applied as much to Stryker. It could be based on our market presence, and the momentum that we have in those regions.", "Joanne Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets", "That's helpful. And as a follow-up question, the two points that you will experience in tax reduction in 2015, does that become status quo, or is there still more room for you to move it down? Thank you.", "Bill Jellison", "That's a loaded question. I think that you can assume that we have a number of different areas that we want to continue to focus on, and ultimately can see opportunities for improvement, but also keep in mind that worldwide, pressures within different municipalities around the world, both in the U.S. and other European and international countries, are all looking for ways to increase their broader based revenue.", "So while we have opportunities on improvement, there is also the broader pressure on areas where governments or different areas are trying to help or reduce kind of those levels, from at least the impact on their overall tax rate.", "So we are absolutely focused on it, and we are going to continue to make efforts there. But as far as projecting it, we aren't projecting anything in Jan 2015.", "Kevin Lobo", "If you look at the last 10 years in Stryker's performance on this line, it has been pretty steady and pretty meaningful improvements; and this is a big change which required a -- it was a big project. But you shouldn't assume that we are content and that we are going to just sit still.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matt Taylor - Barclays", "Hi, couple of questions. So you had a really nice quarter on your capital business and talk about this improving environment; that's a little inconsistent with some of the other results we have seen and what hospitals are talking about. So I am just curious if there is anything to do with new products or big orders or you really think that they are opening up for whatever reason, is it ACA or some factor in Europe that we are not seeing, because a lot of other things that we have seen so far, seem to point to relatively weak capital market?", "Kevin Lobo", "I would go back to our comments which were -- we are seeing signs of a moderate improvement in the capital environment. Its very difficult for us to know how much of that is just us executing better than competitors, versus an overall strengthening in the market. But just looking at our medical results and looking at our pipeline and thinking about the momentum we are seeing really across our MedSurg businesses on the implant and the capital side, that's what we are seeing now. Again its just one quarter, and we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves, but we feel pretty good about sings of at least a moderate improvement in the overall environment. ", "Matt Taylor - Barclays", "And then on ortho, are you seeing any disruption from other big deals that are going on in the space? Is that something you could take advantage of, and what are you doing well in hips and knees that your competitors aren't doing that?", "Kevin Lobo", "So I'd say, related to consolidation and disruption, we are not really seeing much in the way of disruption yet. As we saw with the previous big acquisition, the disruption really didn't occur sort of post implementation. Once implementation begins and people really understand what does this mean to me, that's when we really start to see disruption. So I would say its sort of business as usual right now, and we are seeing a pretty stable marketplace, at least at this point, once the companies integrate, that's usually when we see -- tend to see more turmoil.", "As it relates to our performance, the story on hips is not a new story, somewhat like trauma. Trauma of course, double digits, and continued sustained performance; in hips, if you go back 12 quarters, we have been growing faster than the market, at a pretty steady rate. A combination of some new products like Accolade II, as well as really strong execution in the field; and then on the knee business, we have just been performing with the market, which is a very good performance, given that we had two large competitive launches, that we have been able to perform well.", "So our field sales organization has done really an excellent job, and we feel we are in a very good position.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein - JPMorgan", "I think I had everything answered. Thanks guys.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thank you, Mike.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, thanks for the follow-up. I just wanted to confirm two things, I guess; one on the FX, the $0.10 to $0.12 that is incremental to what you would expect to finish 2014 at?", "Bill Jellison", "That's correct. That's the year-over-year impact that we would see next year.", "Kevin Lobo", "That's if exchange rates stay at their current levels.", "Bill Jellison", "Based on current rates, right.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "And this year, what is the total FX included within your forecast roughly?", "Bill Jellison", "The FX that we are talking about in 2014 is now up to about $0.12 negative impact for us, and that's about $0.04 worse than what we expected at the end of the second quarter. Most of that $0.04 differential is occurring in the fourth quarter.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah. So Bill mentioned before, once that hit us in the third quarter, if the rates stay where they are now, there would be a $0.03 additional hit in the fourth quarter. So its just coincidental that that $0.12 would be similar to next year.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And then just a bigger picture I guess, if we look at the overall pricing dynamics of hips and knees down in the mid single digits. We are still seeing really strong, obviously sales growth and I don't suspect mix is contributing all that much, so its really implying you got unit volume growth probably somewhere in the mid to high single digits. How long do you think you can seek kind of this high single digit volume growth, really sustain itself, and what would be a more normalized unit growth environment?", "Katherine Owen", "I think its fair to say that your statements are correct mix. It has just been a modest benefit, nowhere near offsetting price, and the unit volume growth is very healthy. Certainly in the case of hips, we think that is also reflective of consistent market share gains. And its difficult to know exactly what the market is going to grow at on a go forward basis. We have been talking about it being largely stable. We don't see any reason really to move away from that. What we are really focused on though, is how do we drive market share gains, whether its with our existing portfolio and products like Accolade II, or obviously getting into next year and beyond leveraging the MAKO. So its really all about market share being our focus.", "Its 5:45, I think we are going to wrap the call up operator.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2014 results will be held on January 27, 2015. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Baird", "Operator", "Welcome to Stryker's Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Cuba and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO; and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on our M&A activity. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly reports, before turning to question and answers.", "Our topline performance in Q4 reflected our ongoing goal to grow organic sales at the high end of MedTech. With both the fourth quarter and full year revenue increasing close to 6%, excluding the impact of FX and acquisitions, we maintained strong sales momentum and delivered results at the high end of our initial expectations of 4.5% to 6% growth.", "Q4 results were impacted by one less selling day, which negatively impacted sales by approximately 1%. Somewhat to prior quarters, our diversified revenue base remains a key advantage as all three business segments; Orthopedics, MedSurg, and Neurotechnology and Spine, again delivered positive year-over-year gains.", "In the U.S., Orthopedics, which is up against very tough comparisons from 2013 registered over 7% growth. Trauma and extremities including foot and ankle continued it's impressive multi-year track record with healthy double-digit growth. Hips once again posted strong results while knees came in flat.", "Turning to MAKO, we're gaining considerable momentum with the sale of 20 robots in the quarter, up from eight in Q3 and the highest level of quarterly units ever achieved. Q4 also represented the highest MAKO procedure volume increasing double-digits year-over-year. Katherine will provide additional details regarding the number of key milestones for MAKO that we're targeting in 2015.", "U.S. MedSurg had a standout quarter led by impressive organic growth for both instruments and medical. Continued gains for Neptune, our strengthening hospital CapEx environment and strong sales force execution drove these results.", "Our U.S. Neurotechnology businesses continued their momentum with double-digit growth, which more than offset some softness in our core spine business. Coming off a strong Q3 of this year and strong comps from Q4 of last year, our international businesses grew nearly 4% in constant currency.", "Our challenges in Japan, which began in Q2 with a difficult ERP implementation continued and were acute in hips and knees. Our other divisions had good performances and we are particularly pleased with our results in China and sustained growth in Europe.", "Gross margin came in slightly above Q3 levels, reflecting similar trends we experienced throughout the year, including pricing headwinds, the negative effect of mix and foreign exchange, while also reflecting ongoing improvements in cost of goods sold.", "We remain focused on reducing operating cost with SG&A as a percentage of sales decreasing by 140 basis points year-over-year. R&D increased the year-over-year both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales, underscoring our ongoing commitment to innovation, both internal development and acquisitions, the benefits of which are apparent in out topline performance.", "Looking ahead to 2015, we are well positioned to continue our growth. The new European regional headquarters coupled with our just launched transatlantic operating model will set the stage for multiyear improvement in our growth profile in Western Europe and while some emerging markets have been more challenging, we remain bullish on growth prospects in China and India.", "Headroom remain most notably a significant negative foreign exchange impact on EPS of $0.30 a share based on current rates. However with a strong topline, ongoing reductions and operating cost and a healthy balance sheet and cash flow, we're well positioned to optimize shareholder value.", "For 2015, we're targeting organic sales growth of 4.5% to 6% with adjusted EPS in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 a share, up 4% to 8%. Excluding the impact of core foreign currency, our underlying EPS growth would be in the range of 10% to 14%. Given the heightened volatility and foreign exchange rates, we will update these impacts each quarter throughout the year.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on the performance of our recent key acquisitions.", "In early January, we completed our most recent acquisition of privately held CHG hospital beds, which show a series of innovative, low height hospital beds and related accessories in markets across Canada, the U.S. and U.K. The low height design helps reduce the risk of patient falls that are related to entering and exiting hospital beds.", "Amongst CHG's innovative offerings is the recently launched Spirit One bed, which is an expandable low-height bariatric bed for the acute care segment. With this acquisition we're able to expand medical offerings of products that enhance the quality of care for both patients and healthcare professionals by helping to prevent patient related injuries resulting from a fall from a hospital bed.", "Turning to MAKO, as Kevin mentioned, we're excited about the increasing momentum we're experiencing. In late 2014 we submitted the 510-K application for our total knee on the MAKO robot and continue to target 2015 for FDA clearance.", "Given the necessary training and education post approval, we assume any revenue contribution from this indication will be somewhat limited in 2015, we expect to see a more meaningful ramp in 2016.", "Beyond the total knee, we're targeting Q2 for a limited release of our cement less uni knee on the robot and we're also preparing to launch Stryker's hip power brands including our highly successful accolade hip on the robot this year as well as our X3 poly bearings.", "In summary, the teams have made tremendous progress on the pipeline over the past 12 months and going forward, we're well positioned to drive adoption and leverage the considerable breadth of Stryker's reconstructive sales and marketing presence.", "Lastly I'll provide a few comments on one of our most recent acquisitions, Small Bone Innovations, which we acquired in August of last year. We continue to be pleased with the progress we're making with sales tracking well against our plan. We've conducted extensive training over the past six months, which will continue into the first quarter and it includes the entire SBI portfolio of products.", "The STAR Ankle is an important addition to our foot and ankle portfolio and with our dedicated sales force, we expect to see continued strong momentum in 2015.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks Katherine. Sales growth was 6.1% in the fourth quarter including a negative 2.6% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was 8.6% which includes organic growth of 5.5%. Sales growth for the full year was 7.3% with organic growth of 5.8%, acquisition growth of 2.5% and a negative 1% impact from FX translation.", "EPF on a GAAP basis for the fourth quarter were $0.67 per share versus $1.01 per share last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.44 per share in the quarter versus $1.29 per share in the quarter of last year. This quarter\u2019s EPS includes negative impact of approximately $0.06 from FX or $0.02 to $0.03per share worse than the prevailing Fx rates that we signaled on our third quarter earnings call.", "Foreign exchange rates were very volatile during the fourth quarter and the Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar, the Euro and any other currencies continue to weaken against the dollar. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis for the full year of 2014 were $1.34 versus $2.63 last year while adjusted earnings per share were $4.73 versus $4.49 per share last year.", "CapEx negatively impacted the full year results by approximately $0.14 per share. The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter included charge of approximately $116 million net of approximately $179 million of insurance recoveries received associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II. The adjustment also included an additional tax expense associated with the transfer of intellectual properties of the Netherlands from some of our other European locations.", "The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time and as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined.", "Looking at sales in the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate of 5.5% was comprised of a positive 7.4% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 2% points. Acquisitions added 3.1% while FX added a negative 2.6% in the overall sales for the quarter.", "Looking at our segments, Orthopedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Orthopedic products were up 1.7% as reported and grew 4.5% at constant currency and increased 1.8% organically. US Orthopedics sales grew 7.3% in the quarter.", "Trauma and Extremities once again had another solid quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 18.7% and mid-single digit in international markets with approximately 25% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business excluding the impact from the acquisition of SBI, as we continue to have great success in an expanding market.", "U.S. hips continued to increase its strong performance and grew 4.5% in the fourth quarter while U.S. knees were flat and internationally sales were down 5% in hips and reflect in knees in constant currency as negative pricing and operational performance in Japan and comps were tougher within the period.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 12.1% as-reported and 14.1% in constant currency and increased 9.4% organically.", "These results benefited from double-digit growth in our instruments business, as we continued our strong performance across our product lines and reestablished clear market leadership with the Neptune product back on the market this year. These are on a like-to-like comparison with Neptune as we re-launched the product in the first quarter of 2014.", "We also had upper teen growth in endoscopy, driven by recent acquisitions. Medical also had a strong mid-teen organic and constant currency growth this quarter as the hospital capital market is picking up and we are driving excellent sales execution.", "Our final segment Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 18% of our sales in the quarter, increased 3.9% as reported and 7% in constant currency with 6.3% organic growth. Growth in this segment was led by double-digit growth in our Neurotechnology businesses and IVS while spinal implant sales decreased slightly.", "And looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter of 2014 were nearly flat sequentially at 66.1%. This compares to 66.3% in the same quarter last year. The decline in the margin rates in the quarter resulted both from negative product mix and negative price pressures. Our mix was negative in this quarter due to the impact of recent acquisitions and strong sales of our MedSurg products. These products have a lower gross margin rate than the company average.", "Pricing was down 2% in the quarter and also 2% for the full year. Pricing pressure remains challenging and is expected to be down approximately 2% for the company moving forward. Margins were also negatively impacted from foreign exchange movements compared to last year.", "Research and development expenses were 5.8% of sales, slightly higher than last year in the quarter and this is a 10% increase in R&D spending over last year, while still nicely leveraging our overall operating expenses in the period.", "Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis expenses were $857 million or 32.7% of sales in the quarter versus 34% in the prior year period. Strong sales growth and our cost improvement efforts delivered over a four percentage point of operational expense leverage in both the quarter and in the full year.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 27.5% in the fourth quarter of 2014 compared to 26.% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The rate was positively impacted by operational improvements and solid improvements in operating expense leverage partially offset by lower pricing, acquisition and product mix and foreign exchange rates in the quarter.", "Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 43.6%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 22.6%. This compares to a 24.2% adjusted effective tax rate in the fourth quarter last year. As we mentioned earlier, we have officially opened our new European headquarters in Amsterdam. Last year, we transferred intellectual property from other countries within Europe to the Netherlands and also made decisions to repatriate nearly $2 billion from Europe to the US. Most of those funds will be transferred to the US in the back half of 2015.", "These actions triggered a tax expense between both in the third and fourth quarter of this year. The cash outflows repayment of this tax will be fully paid out in the first half of 2.15. The transfer of the intellectual property provides us more flexibility in managing our operations in the future and aligns the ownership with where our primary European leadership team will be located.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $5 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.", "And from an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the fourth quarter at 54 or one day better than the fourth quarter of last year or of 2013 and Days in inventory finished the quarter at 160 days, which was a eight day increase compared to 152 days in the fourth quarter last year due to acquisitions and some higher inventory in some of our international locations.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in 2014 was $1.8 billion which was similar to 2013. Capital expenditures were $233 million in 2014 compared to $195 million in 2013.", "Share repurchases, we still have over $500 million available for share repurchase under a current authorization as approximately $100 of share repurchases were made at 2014 but no additional shares were repurchased in the fourth quarter.", "As we look to 2015, our sales guidance includes constant currency growth of 5.5% to 7% with organic sales growth in the range of 4.5% to 6%. The foreign exchange rates hold near current levels. We expect net sales in the first quarter and full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 3% to 4% points.", "Each quarter had the same number of selling days in 2015 as in 2014. Pricing pressure will continue and is expected to be lower by approximately 2% for the company moving forward consistent with the pricing environment we experienced throughout 2014. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2015 will be closer to 20% or over two full percentage points lower than in 2014.", "As mentioned previously, we plan on reinvesting approximately half of our tax savings associated with European Regional Head Quarters. These additional investments will be to support our new structure within Europe and to supplement our selling and marketing activities.", "Please also note that the renewal of the tax extenders for 2015 is reflected in our projected tax rate and our earnings guidance for the full year. However, we do not have any benefit planned in our first quarter guidance and we don\u2019t expect them to be approved until late in the year.", "If the extenders are not approved and made effective again this year, it will negatively impact our earnings guidance for the full year by approximately $0.05 per share. Capital expenditures are expected to be slightly over $300 million in 2015 and as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure and assuming there are no debt increases for acquisitions or significant share repurchases, we would expect net interest expense to run approximately $30 million for quarter on an average for 2015.", "Based on the current FX rates, we would expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.30 per share for the full year and approximately $0.08 for the quarter -- the first quarter. This is higher than we have shared a few weeks ago as the Euro has weakened further by nearly four to five percentage points and the Swiss Franc suddenly strengthened approximately 15% after it decoupled its currency sealing from the Euro recently.", "This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of FX which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of FX on earnings is being offset by both natural and real hedges which we continue to layer into our operations.", "And finally, 2015 adjusted net earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10 with adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.05 to $1.10 for the first quarter of 2015.", "Thanks for your support and we\u2019d be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Great. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thank you. Can you hear me okay?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah we can.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay perfect. Let me start with a balance sheet question and for those who weren\u2019t at the conference couple of weeks ago, we had talked about the comments that Stryker put in the press release on the preliminary 4Q numbers about utilizing the balance sheet.", "In the fourth quarter, the company didn\u2019t buyback any stock. Can you just talk about just kind of current thoughts on A; why didn\u2019t you buyback any stock in the fourth quarter? And could you just give us some more of your thoughts relative to the use of the balance sheet in 2015 just building off the comments you made a couple of weeks back?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah Mike. So this is Kevin. So what I would tell you on that is what I have been consistently saying which is the first priority for cash is for acquisitions and obviously the timing of acquisitions is unpredictable.", "And that if those acquisitions don\u2019t materialize in a reasonable period of time, then we would be open to larger share buybacks. So right now, we are pursuing the acquisition deal flow and we'll see what happens.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay and the -- is the plan -- so the plan for now, don\u2019t buyback any stock until you have a better read on the M&A environment and depending on how it plays out, then you would start to buy back stock, but ultimately the goal is the thought process at least is to end the year with a balance sheet that has more leverage than it does going into the year?", "Katherine Owen", "Maybe I will chime in with a couple of comments. There is really no change from our expectations from prior years as Kevin said, M&A is the primary use, in any given year we assume something in the $400 million range in terms of share repurchases and I think that should be the assumption around expectations at the start of this year given what we know.", "And then if the deal flow doesn\u2019t keep pace as Kevin mentioned before, we would be open to larger buybacks, but as a going in assumption what\u2019s reflected in our range is the normal something in that $400 million-ish vicinity in terms of normal year buybacks.", "It will vary quarter-to-quarter for a variety of reasons, but that should be a good assumption that\u2019s reflected in the range we put out.", "Mike Weinstein", "Katherine, the comment from the press release and from a couple of weeks back relative to exiting 2015 with a different balance sheet and the company entered 2015. That still holds the idea that the company does have a different view than Stryker had historically on utilizing the balance sheet?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah Mike. What I\u2019d say, we didn\u2019t put a specific timeframe. In the press release we didn\u2019t say exiting 2015, but what we did say is we acknowledge the strength of our balance sheet and that we do plan to put our money to work.", "So while we weren\u2019t specific in timing, we do say that over a reasonable period of time, we will not stay at the kind of balance sheet position that we are in right now and it's possible for me to put a precise date on that, given the timing of our deal flows, but the statement was put in there for a reason.", "And the reason the statement was put in there is to acknowledge the strength of the balance sheet and that we do plan to put it to work, but we were not specific in terms of whether that will be over a six month, nine months, 12 months period of time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead David.", "David Lewis", "Good afternoon. Kevin, I think the one issue in the quarter is lot of strength in a lot of different segments but U.S. recon and obviously O.U.S. Japan you talked about but it wasn\u2019t clear in the U.S. what specifically is pressuring hips and knees. It looks like the price was stable sequentially.", "Many of your competitors also dealt with more challenging comps. Was there anything specific you can point us to in U.S. subsidies, which could have driven the incremental comp adjusted deceleration?", "And in your assumptions in 2015 can you give us a sense of what that assumes in terms of this strong CapEx business? Does it also assume a recon here in the U.S. in the first half of '15?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, so David. What I\u2019d say is we certainly had very strong comps from the prior year right. We have are plus 10% in the U.S. in hips, we were plus 8% in the U.S. in knees, but we haven\u2019t seen all of our competitors report yet. So I\u2019d really want to wait to see how everybody else reports before we determine how our results stack up versus all of the competition.", "I would say we didn\u2019t notice the same kind of spike in the fourth quarter of 2014 as we noticed in the fourth quarter of 2013. And so normally, what we see over a six-month period is you'll start to see a big spike and then you see a drop off.", "So we will see what happens over the course of the first quarter this year, but I would think with the spike being not as dramatic that we won\u2019t see quite as much of a drop off this quarter, but we still believe we're doing well in the market with knees. We've been holding our own over the last couple of years and don\u2019t anticipate that anything major has changed there.", "And as it relates to the CapEx environment, certainly we had a fantastic fourth quarter of last year across all of our MedSurg businesses and medical in particular had a very, very strong jump towards the end of the year. We're seeing a better environment overall. We're also executing very, very well in the field. So we do expect continued strong momentum in MedSurg in 2015.", "Operator", "Thank you. And now our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.", "Bob Hopkins", "Thanks very much. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, we can Bob.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great, good afternoon. So just to follow up on Mike\u2019s question on basically the guidance and the balance sheet, so you're guiding to $4.90 to $5.10 and Katherine, I think you said that assumes a normalized $400 million in buyback. So is it sort of a logical conclusion here that if there are no larger deals, then it\u2019s likely that you\u2019d have a larger buyback which would put upward pressure on this EPS range that you're providing today?", "Katherine Owen", "I think Bob that the assumption that $300 million to $400 million that\u2019s the normal walking around in any given year level of buybacks and exactly if the pace of acquisitions isn\u2019t such that it\u2019s keeping up with the cash flow we generate, we would be open to doing larger buybacks.", "There is a lot of variables that go into what could impact the upper or lower end of our range and obviously FX is probably the biggest one but clearly just isolating that to the degree that buybacks are larger and that would be reflected towards the upper end of the range.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay. And then one follow-up for Bill, could you just walk me through the comment that your guidance here is assuming that you'll drive 10% to 14% underlying EPS growth obviously ex the currency impact.", "So I guess a little over 5% of that is from revenue growth, 2% from tax rate, a little bit from buyback, how much underlying operating margin leverage are you assuming in 2015 in this guidance?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure actually Bob within a current year guidance, we don\u2019t give operational income related guidance. I think that what we have said in the past is that we do drive to get operating leverage in the 20 to 30 basis points or so per year, on an average, at least over a two or three year period of time.", "Keep in mind that we also mentioned earlier this year and also just now on the call as far as that we are planning to reinvest some of the dollars associated with the tax improvements in the rate side of equation back into some of the expense categories.", "So you probably won\u2019t see as much leverage overall within the operating income side as we would normally be driving especially in the expense category.", "Operator", "Thank you. Go ahead.", "Bill Jellison", "So I was just going to add Bob, on the EPS line, the 10% to 14% improvement is clearly a strong underlying performance on earnings per share and the tax benefit is about 1.5. So if you assume that the $0.07 is reinvested, it's about 1.5% improvement. So even if you take the 1.5 out, it\u2019s still growing EPS significantly faster than our top line in 2015.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi thanks for taking the question. I was wondering if you could just go over again the international performance within the orthopedic business. I know you commented on Japan, but maybe if you could help us just understand how quickly it will take to turn that around and just remind us again the breakout of what Europe did relative to Japan in the quarter?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah so Kristen just a high level I\u2019d say, Japan is certainly the biggest market that we have internationally and we mentioned on past two calls that we had an ERP system that didn\u2019t go very well. That system is now stabilized. That\u2019s the good news.", "The bad news is that while we're going through our challenges especially in the hip and knee market which has instruments and sets and where system reliability is extremely important.", "We certainly lost market share and we now need to regain that market share and just because our system is fixed, the business is not going back to us automatically. So we have to re-earn that business.", "I would think that we will start to see that improve beginning in the second quarter of next year. I would say Europe overall continues to perform well slightly pacing with growth and slightly pacing above the market.", "In any given quarter, you can see variations between our capital equipment and our implants and we don't sort of break down every single country and regions between implants in capital, but I\u2019d say that the biggest reason for that sluggishness in recon and particularly in hips is Japan.", "And that\u2019s a market that historically has been very reliable for us and where we have very strong market share, but certainly it has been a drag in the second half of this year and particularly in the fourth quarter and we're going to turn that around.", "So I would assume by the end of '15, we will be back but it\u2019s -- like we saw in Europe. It took us a little bit of time. This one unfortunately was a bit self-inflected. I expected that I have a new CIO and a new leadership team in our information technology group.", "The CIO was hired at the end of May and he has added four new leaders to his team. So I am a lot more optimistic about future ERP implementations but this one certainly has been challenging and had a knock-on effect of losing market share.", "Kristen Stewart", "So just to make sure I understood, you said that Japan is going to continue to be a drag. This year we won\u2019t see improvement until the second quarter of 2016?", "Kevin Lobo", "No 2015.", "Kristen Stewart", "'15, okay.", "Kevin Lobo", "We'll start to see improvement by the end of 2015 -- by the second quarter of '15.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay.", "Kevin Lobo", "But it won\u2019t get fully back I don't think towards the end of the year.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.", "Raj Denhoy", "Hi thank you. I wondered if I could ask you a bit about the Mako performance in the quarter. You may be highlighted the 20 orders that you placed. I am curious maybe you can offer in terms of where are those replaced, what\u2019s driving that demand?", "And then secondly as you prepare to launch the -- or get approval and launch the knee product in the U.S., when might we see some data in terms of some of the performance attributes of that product?", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah I will take that and we weren\u2019t really pleased. Obviously we had some integration challenges earlier in the year and -- but we worked through a lot of those and being able to really leverage the breadth of our sales and marketing infrastructure.", "I won\u2019t be specific about which locations and where we placed the 20 robots. I would say though the teams have done a great job of making sure when they do place a robot, it\u2019s in a facility that has a clear surge and champion and that really is key to ensuring that the utilization rates and the procedure volume is consistent with the expectations when we place that.", "So they're in the right locations and we will continue to drive that strategy going forward. In terms of clinical data, there is -- we will have data at AOS. There is a number of studies that have been done but it will take time. The early adopters will be less focused on longer term follow-up studies, but we're investing a lot in clinical data and understanding importance to driving long-term wide-scale adoption.", "Raj Denhoy", "If I could ask, maybe one follow-up on that? In terms of -- I think you highlighted that when you looked at the investments you made in various areas. Maker really was your investment in orthopedics or has been to date in kind of orthopedics and I am -- I guess I am curious about how you view that investment?", "Is this really where you're seeing the future of orthopedics developing over time or do you still think there is a role for sort of the old way of doing orthopedics as well?", "Katherine Owen", "Well, we\u2019ve made a number of bets in various sizes within orthopedics if you look at SBI and foot and ankle for trauma in extremities which falls under that umbrella but in terms of the largest bet, yes clearly MAKO is a big bet.", "We're in the enviable position and given our balance sheet and our cash generation, we can continue to do the tucking deals which tend to be the majority of our M&A, but make these bigger bets. We really believe it is going to revolutionize how orthopedic surgery, reconstructive surgery is performed.", "We think the total knee, which we filed for in late 2014 is by far the biggest market opportunity and it is a big bet. We believe we can drive meaningful market share gains, which has really never been done on a sustained basis in the reconstructive market.", "So it\u2019s a clear bet on the direction that the industry is going to go and the benefit that we can bring to patients, to surgeons and to the overall healthcare systems with the technology that we got with the robot.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jason Wittes", "Hi. Thank you very much. So last week, I attended a podiatric meeting and I was very surprised at how well you guys have been doing in building out large contract with hospitals, especially in the foot and ankle business, but also amongst trauma and extremities.", "So I guess, I just wanted to kind of get a better sense of your strategy here. Should we assume that when you're looking at those areas, those are areas that you look at as right for hospital contracting and some type of bundling? Is that kind of the right way to think about it?", "Kevin Lobo", "We'll, we shifted our focus about three years ago to moving towards full account conversions, which is frankly something that wasn\u2019t possible. Five, six years ago we didn\u2019t have the product portfolio to be able to do like a complete account conversion and so we would have niche products in different hospitals around the country and that shift and focus to total account conversion took us a little bit of time, but it\u2019s not working.", "So we're providing the service, we have all the products in our portfolio either through primarily internal development, but also supplemented by acquisitions where we can actually run the entire trauma service center and service line of a hospital.", "And then obviously foot and ankle, there is a presence within the hospital, but there is also podiatric surgeons that are operating outside of a hospital.", "So we have a dedicated team that sells outside the hospital and we have our existing trauma and extremities sales force that\u2019s selling inside the hospital. So we are very pleased with the -- obviously the performance. The market share we've been gaining over the past five years, steady growth as well as getting into a new market and growing our sales in foot and ankle where people were not using implants before.", "So it\u2019s been a great experience over the past few years to watch the foot and ankle business grow. With the SBI acquisition, we've also acquired some upper extremity products that look very exciting and I think that\u2019s the market that we see as right for growth as well and we will be piloting some specialized sales people in the upper extremities area and we look to grow that going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Derrick Sung from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.", "Derrick Sung", "Hi good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I was wondering if I could first get your thoughts on a few aspects around the consolidation that\u2019s happening across the industry namely in the near term, are you seeing any potential advantages from the disruptions with the potential -- upcoming consolidations from one of your large competitors.", "Longer term, how do you see the price environment evolving with consolidation in the industry and do you see room for further consolidation beyond where we are at today?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah so I am not going to talk about further consolidation, but what I would say is every time there is an acquisition in the space, there is disruption. So we certainly saw that with a few [some] [ph]. We saw disruption and many of our competitors as well as us were able to capitalize on that.", "I think with the upcoming mergers in the environment, there will be disruptions. We haven\u2019t seen it yet. I think once the acquisition happens, you will see some sort of disruption. We plan for that ourselves and we do acquisitions.", "We did the SBI acquisition we planned for a certain level of disruption. We experienced some disruption of our own when we did the MAKO integration. So integrations will always create some form of disruption. It tends not to be long term in nature, but certainly something that we look to capitalize upon as any competitors of ours would have mergers or acquisitions in their space.", "Derrick Sung", "And what about the pricing environment? Do you expect that to change at all with the consolidation that we're seeing?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah what I would rather sort of step back and look at across all industries. When you see consolidation, generally you tend to see a moderating of your price impact.", "So that will have to play itself out, but normally in any other market when you see the number of competitors reducing, you do tend to see and in our case, obviously a market that has rapid price erosion, you would imagine that that would start to moderate over time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.", "David Roman", "Thank you and good afternoon everybody. I want to start with a question for Kevin. You did talk quite a bit about some of the trend internationally. You referenced the Europe experience and now what\u2019s going on in Japan, but maybe you could just talk about more broadly your ex U.S. strategy that sort of looking at your business compared to the peers.", "International does represent a smaller percentage of total and given some of the fits and starts in that business, are you undertaking more of a broader review of how international is being run and what gives you confidence in the sustainability of a turnaround in those franchises?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah so for us, emerging markets represent 8% of our sales and still does now and obviously, even with strong U.S. dollar, which is driving up its share of our overall sales.", "In that, we had strong growth in emerging markets, strong double digit growth. China continues to be a fantastic market both the premium segment as well as the lower price segment. Those lower price segment products we're going to be launching in India, which had very good growth, but albeit at a small market.", "So I would say within emerging markets, China and India are going to be two areas that we're going to focus very heavily on and that\u2019s from a position of strength. Where we're weaker are in some of the other markets like Russia and Turkey and Brazil and frankly all of Latin America where we've historically had a much lower market share.", "We were starting to invest and obviously you\u2019ve seen what\u2019s happening in those markets. It\u2019s actually not a bad time not to have a huge presence in Russia and Turkey and some of these markets. So we're not going to be hit as hard as some other companies.", "I think we're going to delay those investments until the market gets a little bit more healthy. Europe, we're obviously really focused on Europe and we're investing. We\u2019ve created a reporting structure that has sales and marketing organizations of Western Europe reporting into our divisions that are based in the U.S. and I think that change is dramatic. It\u2019s going to drive focus. It's going to drive specialization and our market shares in Western Europe are far below where they are in other markets.", "So Japan to me, this is an anomaly. This is a market that we've historically been very, very strong and same as Australia. It's a very strong market that had another great year in 2014.", "Challenge is there, you have foreign exchanges working heavily against us and obviously, Bill talked about the magnitude of foreign exchange impact in 2015 but this is not doing complete overhaul of international.", "We're dialing back in some of the emerging markets, continuing to invest very heavily in China and India, focusing on Western Europe, which I have talked about for the last three years and actually accelerating that impact with this transatlantic model that we're launching.", "Japan was an unpredicted and it\u2019s a business of our size with the breadth that we have, things sometimes go wrong. So this was a case where we put an ERP system in it. It didn't go well. It uncovered some other problems, which actually changed some of the leadership in Japan to turn around -- things don't always go smoothly.", "So I wish, I could tell you something, but it's not that the strategy was wrong in Japan. We had these types of strong business in Japan for many, many years. We just hit a speed bump and we have to get back on track.", "David Roman", "Okay. That's our perspective and for Bill, one clarification, I am not sure I heard you correctly. I think you said in your prepared remarks $30 million of net interest per quarter, but that would be materially higher than what you've been running, was that right and if so why?", "And then secondly on CapEx that $300 million number for 2015, is that the new run rate or is there something specific going on in 2015 that boost that number above the normalized trend?", "Bill Jellison", "Sure, so first on the CapEx side of the equation, we actually stated that even already last year in advance, so it's going into this year. We actually didn't spend that same level. Some of that got carried over already into 2015.", "We are planning on spending a little bit heavier on an ongoing basis here for a number of reasons as we talked about both reinvesting in some of the IT technology base throughout the organization as well as just covering the faster growth of the organic growth side of our business that we've got and then investing in those businesses around the world.", "So one, I think that that's relatively consistent. We should be actually spending at a higher CapEx level as we mentioned more consistently moving forward over the next, three, four, five years.", "If you talk about the interest expense side, we actually were running pretty close to that same similar level throughout most of 2014. There is actually some adjustments for a couple of different things that have taken place within different periods, but that's pretty much what our average run rate has been throughout this year or throughout the 14 year and as we move into '15, it should run at a similar level.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead with your question.", "Mike Matson", "Thanks. Just a question on the hedging program that you're implementing, I am just wondering is this sort of a moving target? In another words, as the currencies keep moving pretty sharply does that sort of push out the point at which you would be fully hedged?", "Kevin Lobo", "No. so the program that we talked about before, the layered hedging as for transactional related hedges and as we mentioned before a hedging program ultimately mitigates or minimizes some of that volatility in the risk in any specific period. It doesn\u2019t eliminate the risk.", "So if rates went down and stayed down, you're ultimately going to see the impact of those as you continue to move forward. We generally have for our transactional base about six different quarters that are hedged at any point in time and it's a rolling hedge program.", "So you're in essence getting the average of those six quarters in your transactional related purchases, but we're really getting the full impact each quarter of any other translational side.", "So as we've earnings in a specific country, each quarter those earnings get translated at whatever the current rates are and so you'll see that level of impact, but our layered hedging is pretty much in place and should continue to be in place as we move forward.", "Mike Matson", "Okay. And then just with the MedSurg business growing so much faster than your other businesses, I was just wondering if you could remind us what the impact -- what impact that has on your gross and operating margins for the company overall?", "I seem to remember that it has a negative impact on your gross margin, but at the operating line, it's not all that different from the other businesses?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, so we've not given specific feedback on any of our divisions or groups, but I think directionally that's absolutely correct. So our margin rates within our broader base MedSurg Group are lower and actually that is one of the negative mixes that we talked about as MedSurg has been obviously growing much quicker than some of our businesses, especially during 2014.", "And from an overall operating income perspective, all of our businesses perform extremely well within the broader base environment, but some do have slightly lower rates, but just not to the same degree.", "So in categories like MedSurg while margins would be low -- gross margins would be lower, you would also be having some level of lower expenses to support that maybe our orthopedic group we have.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.", "Bruce Nudell", "Hi, thanks so much. Kevin could you talk briefly in your view about the importance of cement less knee especially in the younger population, is that going to be enabled by the robot and if you're able to get a cement less knee, does that have intrinsic cost of goods advantages?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, so we did launch a cement less knee with a 3D printed to their base plate about a year ago or started to see that perform very, very well and the 3D printing manufacturing enabled a very poor structure, which adheres to the bone very effectively and we launched it very sort of slowly with the limited launch last year.", "That's gaining steam and as you all know, the cement is used in most keens whereas hips are cement less as it occur in the United States. We do think that's going to be important for the future. The robot will make it even easier, but we already have a product on the market right now that we're trying to push and we're going to push that more aggressively in 2015.", "But if the robot will enhance that and enable that longer term, then we do believe that, that is going to become a big part of the market. It has obviously taken longer than it has in hips, but that's something that we see of being important in the future.", "Also for the robot, I think the team pertaining for knee where you keep the ACL intact. I think that could become a very big part of the market. It's obviously tiny today and will take years to play out, it's starting to prove that, but again that's extremely hard procedure and really will not be able to be done very effectively and consistently without the use of a robot.", "So there is a lot of reasons why we make that on MAKO, it's not just to be able to put in the existing procedures the same way they're being put into today, but also being able to develop these new procedures as you've just outlined.", "Bruce Nudell", "And could you just elaborate a little bit on the transatlantic approach to U.S. and European sales and like just some of the nuts and bolts aspects that you think will be impactful?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, so we have let's call it eight divisions and we have a number of business units underneath those divisions. So each one of those divisions is going to have a Vice President and General Manager in Europe that will have their sales and marketing people in all the big countries reporting to them directly.", "And how that affects the nuts and bolts is in the past we didn't have that business focused on Europe. So you had sales reps selling a wide bag of products that weren\u2019t very focused and the management team when they looked up their organizational chart, they didn't necessarily know that business to the same degree of the specialization and had the same support whether it's marketing materials, training, access to head office.", "Now that's going to be in a tight organizational alignment and we spent a whole year preparing for this. So during the year, when Europe hit their number this year and really did perform very well, the country managers weren\u2019t sure what their job is going to be? Were they going to be one of these General Managers or going to stay at the country level.", "So it's been a whole year preparing for this and establishing these eight key roles. In Western Europe, we still have country managers. The one of the mistakes we had made in prior -- in our prior iteration was taking away the prominence of the Country Manager role.", "We still have that role very much in place. It's a play out and supportive role and to make sure that the things are going well in the country and the key account role with hospitals and with surgeons, but what is going to drive the specialization focus and we've seen in every market where we have specialized sales forces we win.", "It's a straight formula. It's a truism whether it's in Australia, it's in Canada, obviously the United States and we just never got into that stage in Western Europe and we never get to that stage if you just have the country budgets the old way we did it before.", "Now that we've emerged those divisions, so the person who is our President of let's call it hips and knees, our Field President of hips and knees, you have a P&L that includes Western Europe and the United States.", "And when you have that office P&L you have a lot more flexibility with your dollars, because you've bigger marketing budgets, you've bigger R&D budgets, you can move money around and so if you see an exciting opportunity in the U.K. or an exciting opportunity to invest in France, you can balance that against opportunities that exist in the United States and you can move resources more tangibly.", "It also used to take us -- lot of amount of time to get sort of launches and training aligned between Europe and the United States that will be facilitated. So part of the investment obviously is creating these eight roles. Putting them all in Amsterdam, having a state of the art center in Amsterdam where we can actually train surgeons, these are investments that we just haven't made in Western Europe historically and that's one of the reasons why we've just never moved the dial.", "We've been trying for 10 plus years and we've changed the leadership multiple times to change the organizational structures within Europe multiple times and we haven't been able to change the dial.", "So this for us obviously will be a leading Western Europe. He made the first really big improvement over the last two years to get us back on a let's call it market performance or slightly better, but to take the next leap and gain significant market share, this only can be enabled with a dedicated focus across business units.", "So while out of time, when most companies are leading away from Western Europe, we're leaning in Western Europe and it's just because of our current market share position, which is far below what it is in many other countries in the world.", "So whether you're excited about it, it's going to take obviously a number of years to play out, but obviously his idea is still involved and he is still the head of Europe and he is fully supportive of this initiative and really believes that we're doing it the right way.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Hi, can you hear me okay?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes we can.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes we can.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Terrific. Thank you. We've been talking about capital purchases to be increasing about the level almost since we started talking about the raw material. What you saw in the fourth quarter, do you think that's a sustainable level and do you think it's just sort of a fourth quarter yearend push?", "Are we finally starting to see more patient call the need for more capital equipment?", "Katherine Owen", "Hi Joanne. I think it's a little tough to know if it's more patient is a function of ACA. We started to see this improvement in the third quarter. Clearly the trend continued into the fourth quarter.", "Whether hospitals are through the biggest part of their IT investments that they've been making over the last few years or at some manifestation, the increased patients tied to ACA, it's really difficult to get that level of granularity or for just taking market share.", "What I can tell you is that teams are executing really well and we're seeing a clear strengthening in those businesses that we believe is sustainable and we feel pretty optimistic about the momentum that we're going to have for 2015, but I think it's a little difficult to be able to say it's a function of ACA of increased patient demand without a little bit more time under our belt.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Okay. Thank you. And a follow-up what should we be looking for at AAOS this year?", "Katherine Owen", "Well we have a number of things going on including booth tours and clearly MAKO is going to have a big presence there with all the milestones that we talked about upcoming this year and then we will be highlighting a number of products across the portfolio, not just within reconstructive, but trauma, extremities, the SBI ankle, the additions that we made with PIVOT COALESCE.", "So there will be a lot of products that's out there, but obviously MAKO does get a lot of attention.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Terrific. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is going to come from William Plovanic out of Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with your question.", "William Plovanic", "Great. Thanks. Good evening. I just want to check my math. Looking at the knee business, assuming that you had MAKO, you didn't get much for MAKO in the fourth quarter of '13, I think it seems like the U.S. knee business really slowed down, down maybe 4% to 5% by my math, if you strip out MAKO, may be I am off on that.", "Just wondering if you could comment on that at all?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes so, obviously we had a very, very strong fourth quarter last year. It was up 8% and then this year if you strip out MAKO, I think you're little high in your math, but yes, we were slightly down this year.", "If you exclude the MAKO, we don't obviously parse that out precisely, but yes, we were down slightly, but overall if you look over the two year period, I think, we're still tracking pretty consistently.", "Again, not everybody has reported yet, but we also didn't benefit and I think there is a temporary benefit if you launch a new product. We saw that with our Accolade II. If you get them priced with the mix advantages for about a one or two year period, we haven't been getting that since our system isn\u2019t a new system to get some of those temporary benefits.", "But certainly from a customer standpoint, we don't feel reducing really any market share at all and that's been a pretty consistent position that we've had for the last three years.", "William Plovanic", "Okay. And then a follow-up is one of the comments was that there was one less selling day in the quarter. I think that's unique to you and I am just curious, was there actually one less day or was it how vacation sold during the quarter and holidays.", "I think when you say one less selling days, wondering if you could just quantify that and if it was U.S. only, O.U.S. globally, that's it. Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "Obviously we have with all the different countries and we do our math within Stryker based on holidays and in last year we had about one extra day in the first, one less day in the second, one extra day in the third, one less day in the fourth and every quarter we called out whether it was an extra day or less a day and then we give you their organic growth.", "You can see, it's really -- clearly see our organic growth over the full period. The third quarter we also had big, big numbers. We called out one extra day and said we had one extra percent. It's just based on how out calendars are lined up in different parts of the world.", "In '15 I am very pleased to say that we're not going to have any quarters with extra days or less days. It's not something I enjoy talking about. It's kind of a frustrating thing, but it's just based on the way the calendar was laid out '14 versus '13.", "Fortunately in '15, the calendar lines up the same as it does in '14. So we won't be talking about this for the next year, but we were pretty transparent, over the full year, there was no difference in days. In 2014, days were the same as '13.", "It's just the way the holidays fell and we had one extra day in the first, one less in the second, one extra in the third, one less in the fourth.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question or comment.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Hey thanks for fitting me in. two clarification questions, one real question. I just wanted to confirm that the first knee that you're going to launch from the MAKO system total knee is going to be Triathlon you mentioned earlier by [Crusher] [ph] retaining knees.", "Second clarification question, emerging markets grew double-digits, I heard you say earlier, could you give us the exact growth rate on a constant currency basis. Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, we're targeting with our 510-K submission to launch the total MAKO with our Triathlon system in 2015. We don't break out the specific emerging market country growth if that was the second part of your question.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Okay. And then for my real question, your Neurotech businesses accelerated this quarter, can you talk about the potential benefit from the MR Clean study, which you mentioned in the past as being important for that and have you seen an impact from that yet, thanks?", "Katherine Owen", "I wouldn't say that we've seen an impact from the MR Clean study. clearly, we're really excited about it and the potential it can have longer term as we start to build the necessary clinical data to help drive adoption to help further educate and position this to the benefit for this treatment of ischemic stroke.", "But that's going to take time. It's a very positive first step, but there is a lot of market development work that still has to happen including referrals and education and more peer review data, but certainly we're really pleased with it and that group will continue to build on that momentum.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes we obviously had strong double-digit growth across all of our three Neurotech businesses and neurovascular in particular has been gaining market share for the last couple of years in the hemorrhagic segment and MR Clean would potentially open up the ischemic segment of the market and would build upon an already very strong growing business.", "So we've been really excited about the Neurotech businesses and both give us access to our new market. It may take some time, but it can certainly grow because as you know there are more ischemic strokes to non-hemorrhagic.", "So it will take some time in the market. We estimate it's probably about $100 market right now. Could become a market somewhere between the $500 and $1 billion over time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Richard Newitter from Leerink Swann. Please go ahead with your question. Richard, please go ahead, your line is open.", "Richard Newitter", "Hey, sorry. Thanks for taking the question. I had a quick question on the -- so I appreciate that the fourth quarter has a tough comp as it differ us to the industry, from the results referred so far, and your year-over-year growth rate in U.S. knees if your remaining competitors were to report something better and it does appear that you lost share, can you maybe -- first I want to understand why that might be.", "And then in the first quarter of '15 you should have an easier comp, so all comp adjusted, is there any reason why you shouldn\u2019t be growing a lot in the market once comps are taken out of equation?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I would just reiterate the fact that on the knee side, we were up against very tough comps, actually for both hips and knees, the 10% and 8% growth that we talked about with Q4 of '13 being exceptionally strong seasonality effect that we didn't see this year.", "So the biggest factor where the comps and as Kevin also mentioned, we're not seeing the same mix benefit given the fact that Triathlon is not a new system. We do not believe we're losing market share in volumes and as we go forward, particularly with the anticipated launch of the MAKO total knee, we feel really good about our competitive position.", "So clearly Q4 had some challenges, Q1 we wouldn't expect the same level fall off given again it wasn\u2019t a strong Q4 seasonality. Weather is a wild card, I can tell you right now there weren\u2019t a lot of surgeries happening in Boston and there won't be happening tomorrow either, but we did have severe weather last year. We're just going to have to wait and see how the rest of the quarter plays out as it relates to the year-over-year comparison from a weather perspective.", "Richard Newitter", "Great. Thanks and just quickly I know you guys have a reverse shoulder and limited launch I think that's correct, can you give us an update on what you see there for the contribution in '15?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes so the product is performing extremely well. We had a limited launch and we're going to be rolling that out more extensively in 2015. It's obviously a lot of competitors in the market, so I would call it a measured launch and I don't think we will be able to grab the market share as quickly as we had certainly in areas like foot and ankle.", "But we're looking at sort of a total, the reverse shoulder as well as the upper extremities products that we've acquired through SBI and we're looking at how we want to attack other extremities and we have a couple of pilots planned.", "I would think by the middle of the year, I would be able to give you a much better idea on how I think the growth profile will be. I think it's still early days for us. As you know, we've been a little bit late in the shoulder market. It's an exciting market. We believe we have very good products now and we're going to start to put that to work.", "We just want to be careful that we invest the right way and that we get a good return on our investment. Again it's not a new market. This market already exist, but we now feel like we've got a competitive offering, which clearly not the case two, three, four years ago.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ben Andrew", "All right. Good afternoon. I was hoping to get some thoughts on the MAKO performance in the quarter on the run rate basis. Should we look at that placement rate and extend that through '15 as you all roll it out with additional versions of the product and at what point does that become a significant piece of your domestic knee business? Obviously you can't separate the two anymore.", "But how should we think about that in terms of the timing. Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "I am sorry, okay. Okay. I'll take that question, sorry, we're having a audio problem here. So obviously with the launch of the Total Knee and the launch of our Stryker hip products on the robot.", "The robot is going to start to gain a lot more adoption and then our primary end points are going to also be placed on the robot. So the increased run rate works with the existing products, with the MAKO products.", "Our plan is to have as many robots as possible all over the country and that all of our end plants will be placed using the robot as many as possible. It's going to take a long, long time for that to happen.", "So standard instrumentation and standard implants are going to be put in by the majority of surgeons, but our goal is really to increase that run rate, increase the adoption. It's going to be a lot easier for hospitals to afford a robot when they know that they can put other products on it and the implants from a company like Stryker that implants that they know and that they're comfortable with.", "And so yes, you're going to see it increasingly take up more and more of our business and we shouldn\u2019t think of it as a separate business like separate from our existing core business, that's clearly the strategy and it's going to get messy to analyze through say '15, '16 and then it's really going to become part of our normal business.", "It's such a disruptive play that frankly predicting exactly the cadence of the robots, we do expect to sell a lot more robots in 2015. There is some seasonality to it. So obviously the first quarter, you shouldn't it to be more than the fourth quarter.", "The fourth quarter will always be the highest quarter. That's kind of how hospitals buy their capital. We see that with our other MedSurg businesses but we do plan on having a full array of products on the robot, so that the robot will be a lot more meaningful and should consumer much more of our overall volume.", "Ben Andrew", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead with your question.", "Joshua Jennings", "Hi, thanks a lot. I just wanted to start quickly on the U.S. knee business and one of your competitors has implemented a strategy of selling reconstructive joints direct to U.S. hospitals at a meaningful discount.", "You didn't call it out as a competitive headwind in the quarter, but was there any impact in 4Q and can you share your thoughts on the potential impact in '15 and beyond in terms of dynamics of the U.S. market?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, Josh, we have not seen any impact from the -- we're well aware of -- this attempt and it's something that's been tried previously and we didn't see an impact then either and as we look ahead to 2015, it's not something that we were factoring in.", "Obviously we pay attention and we don't want to just make assumptions, but so far we've seen zero impact from it.", "Joshua Jennings", "Great. And as a quick follow-up on the spine division, we had a few positive pre-announcements from some small cap pure spine players earlier this month. Can you talk about your expectations for the U.S. spine market growth in '15 in terms of acceleration stability or deceleration from '14 levels?", "And now you've seen 4Q results and are you comfortable with the strategy in play for Stryker to regain share and accelerate growth in that specific unit? Thanks a lot.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, so certainly the spine market has gone through a lot price challenges over the past four, five years, but innovation has been rewarded. I think the market is trying to turn and we're seeing a positive trend in the market overall.", "We're really excited about our spine business. Obviously we had some challenges at the beginning of this year and overall the results certainly from a profit standpoint were solid. Sales standpoint were not fantastic but I'm very excited about 2015.", "The CoAlign acquisition is a fabulous product. We've also launched some other memory invasive products in a lot of areas that have been a little bit weak for us. We have a new R&D leader that started over a year ago that has really nice looking pipeline.", "We have a new general manager, a new head of marketing. So the management team that we have at Spine is fantastic. I went to the spine meeting -- sales meeting earlier this year.", "I can say the momentum there is better than it's been in many, many years because they have a nice flow of innovative products that you can still gain good price and growth with as we've seen with some of the spine-only companies.", "So I think we're in much better position now than we have been over the past couple of years in spine. In fact the market is trying to look better. So it's a space I am excited about. We have a team in offence that should enjoy significant success in 2015 and the years ahead.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good evening, guys. Just one quick follow-up or not even a follow-up, just one clarifying question, on the R&D side, I know you don't guide line item guidance on things like R&D but in the last few years kind of growing R&D 2X the rate of sales have done faster, is that how we should think about the company going forward here over the next few years.", "We think that maybe some of the MAKO investments start to drop off, maybe some of the Neurotec studies in clinical trial cost start to fall off, but I would like to hear maybe if R&D should keep growing at that rate going forward?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes Jeff, this is Bill. So as far as R&D is concerned, as you know we've increased our overall R&D spend as a percent of sales throughout this year. In fact the whole year ended up about 40 basis points higher kind of north of 6% and I think that you should expect that it's probably in that kind of slightly north of 6% range moving forward.", "I say it's going to be more consistently growing kind of at our broader base sales level, maybe slightly faster, but not at the level that you saw in 2014 as far as from a growth perspective, but as a percent of sales perspective that's probably reasonable.", "Jeff Johnson", "Got it. That's helpful. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And at this time, we have no further questions. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2015 results will be held on April 21, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Lakiba and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during the conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today\u2019s press release that is an exhibit to Stryker\u2019s current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Stryker\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide several updates, including MAKO. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.", "Our first quarter results continue to reflect the strength of our sales and marketing teams, our diversified businesses and the payoff we are realizing from our investments in innovation. We had another strong quarter of organic sales growth of nearly 6% and EPS topped a high-end of our projected range for the quarter. Trauma and Extremities, Sports Medicine, Interventional Spine and our Neurotechnology franchises all continued their momentum from last year with excellent growth. Our medical business also had an outstanding quarter, marking three successive quarters of stellar performance. And our U.S. Hip business helped to fuel the strength in Orthopedics.", "We are pleased with the continued progress on MAKO, which was a highlight of the recent American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons Meeting. And we continue to have a high level of conviction regarding the long-term potential for robotics in orthopedics. We are encouraged with launch of our transatlantic operating model, as Europe posted another good quarter of growth and with strength in divisional leadership is set up for accelerated gains in the years ahead. As a reminder, we have used some of the benefits of our lower tax rate to invest in Europe SG&A.", "Growth within the emerging markets was solid again, as was our performance in Australia. Like any quarter, we had some challenges, including U.S. supply disruptions, which adversely impacted revenue for both Instruments and MAKO implants. The MAKO issues will be resolved in Q2, while the Instruments situation will linger into Q3. Despite these challenges, both businesses managed to post positive growth in the quarter. In both cases, we see delayed sales and no material loss of revenue for the full year.", "Japan is on an improving trajectory and we expect this trend to continue as we move through the year. Growth from our recent acquisitions was also modestly below our expectation in the first quarter, but our teams are excited about the future of these businesses as they work through early integration. Foreign exchange was a negative impact, in line with our Q1 expectations. And if rates remain at current levels, we will generally be in line with the full year guidance communicated in January. We have also repurchased $280 million of our stock year-to-date, $130 million of which occurred during Q1.", "In sum, we are off to a strong start for 2015, with top line strength across our three business segments and balanced globally. We are driving earnings results with disciplined expense management, while continuing to invest in R&D to ensure long-term revenue growth. Our solid balance sheet and cash flow generation remains a key characteristic of Stryker and positions us well as we continue to look for the best ways to invest in our future. As an organization, we are focused on consistently delivering on our targets as we strive to optimize shareholder returns.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on MAKO, progress with our Transatlantic Operating Model or TOM as well as some comments on the recent clinical studies regarding acute ischemic stroke. With respect to MAKO, we are pleased with the continued progress we are seeing following the integration of this business during 2014. In the first quarter, we placed nine robots versus two in the year ago quarter, with the placements representing a nice balance between existing Stryker customers and competitive accounts. We did have some challenges with our MAKO knee implants going to a temporary product supply disruption during the quarter, the impact of which will be fully resolved during Q2. Adjusting for this, our U.S. Knee growth would have been modestly higher.", "Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the strength of the pipeline, which reinforces our conviction in the growing interest in robotics. And with sales force integration complete and new robotic indications now cleared, we are well positioned for 2015 and beyond. With respect to the latter, our Stryker Power Hip brand, including Accolade are now compatible with the MAKO hip application. Additionally, our X3 polyethylene bearings have also been cleared for use with the MAKO Uni implants. Our Total Knee 510(k) application was submitted to the FDA late last year and we are continuing the dialogue with the agency.", "Turning to TOM which went live at the beginning of the year, this initiative will enable us to drive a multi-year improvement in our growth profile in Western Europe. The structure is fully operational, with eight transatlantic division Presidents now having full P&L responsibility for the combined U.S. and Europe businesses. They each have a General Manager, all based at our regional headquarters in Amsterdam with direct responsibility for sales and marketing in Western Europe. The RHQ represents a flagship for our presence in Europe as we bring in HCPs into the site for training and education on our Stryker products. We believe this will be key to strengthening the Stryker brand in Europe and enhancing our relationship with physicians and hospitals. As we discussed approximately half our lower tax savings is being reinvested into our European business in terms of additional sales and marketing headcount and support to help further accelerate growth.", "Lastly, over the past four months, an impressive amount of strong clinical data had been released supporting the use of device-based treatment of acute ischemic stroke. From the acquisition of Concentric, we have pioneered this space in our unique and differentiated products. Trevo represented the majority of the products used in the pivotal MR CLEAN study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine in January. We expect the market will take time to evolve, which will require the automation of EMS transport and inter-hospital transfers, establishment of clinical guidelines, position incentives and investment in new human and physical capital to absorb new patient volume. Clearly as the data comes out, it reinforces our excitement from the ischemic stroke market and its longer term revenue potential. We believe we are well positioned and we will continue to invest in this therapy through further product development, the funding of next generation trials and supporting the full continuum of care for stroke.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was 3.2% in the first quarter including a negative 4.2% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7.4%, which includes organic growth of 5.6%. EPS on a GAAP basis for the first quarter were $0.58 per share versus $0.18 per share last year in the first quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.11 per share for the quarter versus $1.06 per share in the first quarter of last year. This quarter\u2019s EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.08 per share from FX. Foreign exchange rates were very volatile again during the first quarter with the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, euro, Swiss franc and many other currencies weakening against the dollar. The weakening of the Swiss franc and our layered hedging program helped to mitigate the additional weakening of other currencies that occurred within the quarter.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter relates to charge \u2013 a charge of approximately $54 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II and an additional tax expense associated with the transfer of intellectual property to the Netherlands from some of our other European locations. The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined.", "Looking at sales in the first quarter, our organic growth of 5.6% was comprised of a positive 7.1% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 1.6%. Acquisitions added 1.9%, while FX had a negative 4.2% impact on the sales in the quarter.", "Looking at our segments, Orthopedics represented 43% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Orthopedic Products were up 2.4% as reported and grew 7.5% at constant currency and increased 6.5% organically. U.S. Orthopedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter. Trauma and Extremities once again had another standout quarter, with sales in the U.S. increasing 18% and 11% in international markets in constant currency, with over 30% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business or roughly 20%, excluding the impact from the acquisition of SBI, as we continue to have great success with our product offerings in this expanding market. U.S. Hips continued its strong performance and grew 7.5% in the first quarter, while U.S. Knees increased 2.4%. Internationally, sales were down 1.3% in Hips in constant currency and increased 4.5% in Knees in constant currency.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 4.6% as reported, with 7.7% in constant currency and increased 4.3% organically. These results were led by double-digit organic and constant currency growth in our medical business as our sales force, combined with a strong product offering, continue to execute in an improving capital equipment market.", "We also experienced mid to upper single-digit constant currency growth in Instruments, Endoscopy and Sustainability. Our Instruments business was negatively impacted in the first quarter and will also be negatively impacted in the second quarter by product supply issue at one of our suppliers. We believe Instruments organic growth for the quarter would have run at least in the upper single-digits if supply was fully available. This issue was expected to be resolved by early in the third quarter and should have modest impact on Instruments full year results.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 18% of our sales in the quarter, increased 2.1% as reported and 6.6% in constant currency and 6% organically. Growth in this segment was led by double-digit growth in our Neurotechnology businesses and IBS, while spinal implant sales increased slightly in the quarter.", "And looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the first quarter of 2015 were 65.6%, relatively flat with the back half of 2014 and compares to 66.6% in the first quarter last year. Gross profit includes a re-class of expenses in all periods of approximately 30 basis points, which came out of SG&A for consistency. The decline in the margin rate in the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year predominantly resulted from negative pricing pressures and negative mix related to our recent acquisitions. Pricing was down 1.6% in the quarter, better than last quarter and last year, which both ran approximately 2%. Pricing pressure remains challenging and we still expect pricing to be down nearly 2% for the company moving forward.", "Research and development expenses were 6.4% of sales, relatively flat compared to last year in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $854 million or 35.9% of sales in the quarter versus 36% in the prior year period, despite reinvestments to strengthen our European selling and regional headquarter activities.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.3% in the first quarter of 2015 compared to 24.1% in the first quarter of 2014. The rate was negatively impacted by pricing, FX and the mix of recent acquisitions, along with activities to support our European business. These impacts were partially offset by operating improvements in the period.", "Other expense in the first quarter was approximately $28 million compared to $24 million last year in the first quarter. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense in the period. Our reported tax rate for the first quarter was 40.6%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 19.5%. This compares to a 24.1% adjusted effective tax rate in the first quarter of last year.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended up the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and marketable securities. We also have $3.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended in the first quarter at 58, slightly above last year\u2019s first quarter. And days and inventory finished the quarter at 173, just a little bit better than the 174 days in the first quarter of last year.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first quarter of 2015 were $380 million compared to $209 million last year in the first quarter. Capital expenditures were $46 million in the first quarter of 2015 compared to $70 million in 2014. However, capital expenditures are expected to run higher than last year as we move through 2015. We also repatriated approximately $700 million in the first quarter and expect to do approximately an additional $1 billion later this year. We now have over $2.3 billion available for share repurchase under our recently expanded authorization as approximately $280 million of share repurchases were made so far in 2015, with $130 million of that repurchased by the end of the first quarter. We will continue to evaluate the level and frequency of our share repurchases. However, current plans are to fully utilize the current authorization over the next 2 to 3 years.", "Based on our solid first quarter results and current expectations for the remainder of the year, we are well positioned to deliver on our full year sales and earnings guidance. And we are now increasing the lower end of our guidance for both sales and earnings for 2015. Our sales guidance now includes constant currency growth of 6% to 7%, with organic sales growth in the range of 5% to 6%. If foreign exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales for the full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 3.5% to 4.5%, with the second quarter sales projected to be impacted the most and slightly over that range.", "Pricing pressure will continue and prices are currently expected to be nearly 2% for the company moving forward, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced over the last year. The benefit from the renewal of the tax extenders continues to be in our year end earnings guidance and represents approximately $0.05 per share for the year. We continue to expect that they will once again be approved. However, we do not expect them renewed until late in the year. As such, we do not have any benefit from them in our actual results or our planned earnings guidance until the fourth quarter of this year. We also expect that our adjusted tax rate will run at or below the level achieved in the first quarter and will be noticeably better when the benefits from the tax extenders are approved. As mentioned previously, we plan on reinvesting approximately half of our tax savings associated with the European regional tax \u2013 regional headquarters. These additional investments are supporting our new structure within Europe and will also supplement our selling and marketing activities.", "Based on current FX rates, we expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.25 to $0.30 per share for the full year, with approximately half of that occurring in the first half of the year. The further weakening of the euro and most other currencies since our original guidance, along with our hedging program has not resulted in an additional FX impact on us as the Swiss franc has also significantly weakened in that period. That weakening along with the euro makes all of our European produced products less expensive and combined with our layered hedges has fully offset the additional translational impact which occurred. Keep in mind that the full year negative impact of foreign exchange rates movements is largely driven by the translational component of FX, which we do not hedge. And finally, we have heightened the lower end of our earnings guidance for 2015, with adjusted net earnings per share now in the range of $4.95 to $5.10, with adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.15 to $1.20 for the second quarter of 2015.", "Thanks again for your support and we would be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We would now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is going to come from Rick Wise out of Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Rick Wise", "Good afternoon. Can you hear me clearly?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes.", "Rick Wise", "Great. If I could start off with a question on acquisitions, you highlighted that acquisitions were somewhat below expectations can you help us understand a little more detail which were below plan, why and just what the drag on growth and how it all gets resolved?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. Hi, Rick. It really is the recent deals because \u2013 as they pass the 1-year mark, they have become part of organic growth. And nothing that we would call out beyond some of the early normal integration challenges. It\u2019s primarily around the Berchtold acquisition, which we anniversary in the second quarter and within our endoscopy segment. We feel really good about the pipeline and the visibility we have for that revenue to improve as the year unfolds, but it really is just the normal integration, early challenges we have when we bring a new business in.", "Rick Wise", "Yes, thanks. And just as a follow-up on MAKO, Katherine can you give just a little more color on the MAKO performance this quarter, was this as you expected and is this how we think about the quarterly run rate going ahead with obviously fourth quarter because of the capital spending always being a little stronger? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "We are certainly pleased with the increase in year-over-year placements going from two to nine and that it was balanced between existing customers, but also competitive accounts. Clearly, there is a seasonality component to this given the significant capital piece of Q4 to Q1. You are always going to see that drop off. But I would say it was essentially in line with what we were targeting, recognizing we did have some supply disruptions on the knee side that the impact from that was relatively modest.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Katherine Owen", "Hi Bob.", "Kevin Lobo", "Hello Bob.", "Operator", "Bob, if your line is on mute, please un-mute it. Okay. Our next question is going to come from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi, I guess you guys can hear me, right.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes we can.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Kristen.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi. I was just wondering if you could talk about what the re-class was exactly. And then just on the tax rate, it seems like based on your commentary you would expect the tax rate to be a little bit lower than perhaps what you had previously had commented, I just want to make sure that I was hearing about that correctly?", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. So the re-class is really just for consistency. It\u2019s really one of our groups were classifying some of the expenses the same way. So it\u2019s a re-class of some of the freight costs that are coming out of the SG&A category and going into COGS and it\u2019s about 30 basis points, pretty much on average for this year. But all of the restatements will be reflected in the financials in both periods. As far as the tax rate, yes we stated early on in the year that we were expecting at least two full percentage points of improvement off of last year\u2019s rate. I think that we feel very good about kind of one, where the rate came out for the quarter and are pleased with realizing kind of the benefit associated with that. And as we mentioned, we do believe that that rate is sustainable throughout this year. And then also keep in mind, in the fourth quarter when the tax extenders, if they do get approved at $0.05 a share that will affect it by about another full percentage point.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay. So we should be thinking, instead of a rate of close to around I guess 200 basis points lower certainly something greater than that?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes. In total greater than 200 basis points, yes that\u2019s correct.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay, perfect. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thanks, Kristen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thank you. So first question I guess it\u2019s all really guidance questions. First question is the underlying growth actually came in probably a tad below industry where the street for that, obviously very good quarter, so it\u2019s very Stryker-like in terms of the breadth, but you are raising the kind of organic and constant currency guidance for the year, so maybe just touch on what\u2019s driving the increase, given what was a good quarter but not one of your blowout quarters?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, Mike, this is Kevin. I would tell you, we feel very good about the quarter and certainly the outlook for the rest of the year. All of our businesses are performing well by segment, by geography and we even had a challenge within instruments, which is one of our largest divisions that had a supply issue that will get rectified. Obviously, MAKO implants was the more modest, but even that had supplies. So, we fought through some supply challenges, still delivered almost 6% organic growth and feel very good about the position that we are in right now. The expenses are well under control. You heard about bill on the tax rate. So we really have all of our engines firing. And we are feeling very positive as we look through the rest of the year and that\u2019s why we felt confident in raising the lower end of both sales and earnings.", "Mike Weinstein", "Okay. And then on the earnings piece, making sure I have got all the moving parts. So it sounds like the answer to Kristen\u2019s questions on the tax rate is that the tax rate for the year instead of being 20% may end up being closer to 19%, I just want to double check on that. And then the FX thing obviously surprised us because the dollar has gotten over the course of the last 3 months since your last call, on the fourth quarter you guided to $0.30 of impact for the year and now you are saying $0.25 to $0.30, so that\u2019s just the function of basically the Swiss manufacturing and the interchange between the euro, the dollar getting stronger versus euro, but the Swiss franc weakening at the same time?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes. So, both of those questions, on the tax side of the equation, yes we do expect the rate to be lower than the 20% that we talked about. So at least, two if not obviously closer to three which is more in line with kind of where that first quarter is and especially if you add extenders in there, we should absolutely be able to deliver on that \u2013 on the tax aspect piece for the entire year. As far as FX is concerned, you are absolutely right. FX rate definitely weakened further against the U.S. dollar for most currencies. And fortunately, the Swiss also weakened along with it. And if you recall, the Swiss franc actually strengthened when it decoupled away from the euro at the beginning of this year, which actually caused our FX exposure to increase just prior to our guidance for the \u2013 at the beginning of the year. So based on that weakening of the Swiss along with the euro and the hedges that we currently have in place, we believe that we are fully offsetting at least the additional impact of the translational side that\u2019s occurred since our original guidance.", "Mike Weinstein", "Perfect. I will let some others jump in. Thank you, guys.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Roman", "Thank you and good afternoon everybody. I wanted to just start on capital deployment, obviously you made the comments around the share repurchase activity that took place both year-to-date and in the first quarter, could you maybe just talk \u2013 and then I think, Bill you also provided some context as to the timing of when you expected to use the authorization, could you maybe just talk about what were the factors influencing your decision to buyback stock, I think it\u2019s in several quarters since you bought back this type of \u2013 this type of stock and whether we should think about this as a change in the capital deployment priority scheme or just how it fits into the broader strategy?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. I would \u2013 David I would view it as very much consistent with the capital allocation strategy we have tried to articulate. We still view M&A as the primary use with the dedicated BD folks in all of our divisions who are actively looking at targets. We also have with the cash flow, the ability to do buybacks as well as the dividend. And so there is no change. We did increase the authorization. It gives us the flexibility. And we expect to use it over the next 2 to 3 years. I couldn\u2019t predict in any given quarter we will be at these same levels. We usually have an assumption of around $400 million of share repurchases in any given year. This year could be higher than that. It just will depend on how the year plays out, other potential uses of cash and also recognizing the constraints that we along with many others have given where the bulk of our cash is generated being outside the U.S. So, no change whatsoever to the capital allocation strategy. And we are in the \u2013 we have the ability to continue to pursue multiple avenues.", "David Roman", "Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on the P&L, Bill, I think in your description of the gross margin for the quarter, you talked about it being essentially flat with the second half of 2014. Are we \u2013 is that commentary meant to reflect a view that we are sort of coming to an end of the gross margin declines in some of the headwinds that you have sort of soaked up here, whether it\u2019s mix from acquisitions or price or FX are starting to abate in some of the factors here like mix, for example, could actually turn into a headwind as things like your neuro and spine business start to do better or am I reading too much into that?", "Bill Jellison", "No, I think that, that\u2019s at least a fair comment. I think as we \u2013 as you look toward kind of the back end of this year, the remaining part of the year, I think you should expect that our gross margin rate differences on a year-over-year basis should be much narrower than what you have seen over the last year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David Lewis", "Good afternoon. Kevin, just want to come back to where we left off at AOS. I think we and many investors sort of took some of your comments at AOS to be particularly bullish for the outlook for Stryker. And I think certainly your guidance implies acceleration in the back half of the year, but we sort of took your commentary at the academy meeting to be more about years to come, specifically 2016. So, as you think about 2016 and the potential for driving faster growth at Stryker, what are the few things you would point us to which gives you that kind of conviction as we head out into the out years?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, thanks, David. I would say the first thing I would point to is MAKO. As you can see the kind of momentum we have already started to build with 20 robots in Q4, 9 this quarter, a number of our implants getting approved on the robot increased level of interest. And so I would see MAKO as one growth accelerator. Second, I would see the acute ischemic stroke as another area that with all the great data that\u2019s coming out would be another engine. Now, that might take a little bit more than \u201816, but it should certainly start to ramp in \u201816. Our transatlantic operating model, we are very pleased about the upside that, that has. Not so much in the implant side, but certainly, if you look at MedSurg and even parts of Neurotechnology, we have a lot of room to grow our market share and we are very pleased with the start. It\u2019s early \u2013 only one quarter since it\u2019s gone live, but had a very strong quarter and I would see that also accelerating in 2016. So, a number of those levers and then the acquisitions that we have done, we have done a number of, I guess, 6 over the past \u2013 just over a year of bolt-ons. And those bolt-on acquisitions, whether it\u2019s CoAlign, Pivot, Berchtold, all of those go through sort of early integration issues. And then those will start to accelerate. So, I really am excited about the prospects. 2015 will be a solid year. And I think 2016 could set up to be an even better one.", "David Lewis", "Great. And just a quick follow-up on capital deployment, Kevin, there has been a dramatic amount of focus on what you are going to acquire in these last 6 months. Shifting away from what you are going to acquire to the class of thing that you are looking at. There seems to be at least in our view a lot of focus from investors on purchasing for accretion and it takes you some pressure if there is any multiple and really driving accretion. Do you feel that type of pressure? Does the board feel that type of pressure? And where does Stryker come out right now in terms of your preference versus acquisitions for growth versus acquisitions that could be growth or growth and accretion? Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "So, maybe I will take the first part and then ask Bill to chime in, since Bill obviously, the finance group has a big say in terms of making sure we are creating value over the long-term, but we really look to strengthen our businesses and we are looking to do acquisitions. We want to strengthen our market position in the areas where we are playing today and that could be big deals, small deals or medium sized deals, but we want to make sure we are strengthening our position and encouraging our divisions to continue to drive growth. So, most of the acquisitions that we pursue and you have seen this are catalysts for growth and we tend to plug those into existing divisions and then drive accelerated growth. But we are disciplined in terms of the deals that we look at and the price that we paid for deals. Clearly, in the case of a MAKO, that was a disruptive deal, which is a little bit out of the ordinary. But all the other deals go through very rigorous screening to make sure that we are paying the right price and that will create value. Maybe I will turn to Bill in terms of the parameters that we look at when evaluating our acquisitions.", "Bill Jellison", "Sure. So, I would say that we are all very aware of also the need for accretion in the earnings as we do acquisitions. But as we have talked about before, whether we have done maybe some non-accretive deals in the past or not, I think each deal that we look at is really looked at from the standpoint that we think that it ultimately creates value for the company over the mid and long-term as well. And would we be looking or would be willing to still look at an acquisition that necessarily doesn\u2019t or that doesn\u2019t necessarily have accretion in the first year or so? We would. It\u2019s all about whether it ultimately adds value on the back end in an earlier stage business, which we think has much higher growth for the organization than even our base level, we would absolutely make that investment \u2013 another investment like that today. But all of our acquisitions are based on the value that we think we can ultimately create for the shareholders, but we aren\u2019t restricted on just accretion as one aspect of it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to ask one, I guess, on your repurchase change here. So, you did talk about kind of a normal level of $400 million on this call and past calls. And if you just do the 2 to 3 years for the $2.3 billion, obviously, that\u2019s a higher number. So, are you saying that you are just leaning more towards your purchase here, because you don\u2019t have the same kind of M&A pipeline or things aren\u2019t hitting your targets or you are not trying to change your staff at all, I guess I am just a little confused and want to clarify?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, no change in the staff in terms of BD being a priority and then folks as I mentioned out there are actively looking at targets. We have upped the authorization, because we feel we have the flexibility if we decide M&A is inherently unpredictable. So, we wanted to have the flexibility to potentially purchase a greater level. $400 million isn\u2019t exact number it\u2019s a rough number walking around. It could be higher than that this year and obviously to use up the entire amount over 2 to 3 years, we have to increase the level. So, if it\u2019s done in 2 years, we have obviously accelerated the share repurchases and some of that will depend on whether or not BD targets make it through to fruition. As you know, the vast majority of names we look at never translate into an actual deal.", "Matt Taylor", "And then your pricing actually got a little bit better, I guess sequentially looking at the price decline year-over-year. Are you seeing any major changes in price? I mean, there has been some concerns I have seen with investors around value-based purchasing, but maybe too early to call that as a negative factor?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. Pricing has gotten, well, obviously, negative, modestly better over the last few quarters and that\u2019s nice to see, but it\u2019s still in that approximate range of around 2%. It moved around quarter-to-quarter. So, I wouldn\u2019t view the 1.6 as some \u2013 indicative of some big change in the pricing environment. It\u2019s still challenging. We still assume it\u2019s around 2. It will be great if it\u2019s less than 2, but there is no change to our current thinking.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Katherine Owen", "Hey, Bob.", "Kevin Lobo", "Bob, are you there?", "Operator", "Mr. Hopkins, your line is open.", "Katherine Owen", "Okay. Maybe the third time will be the charm with Bob.", "Operator", "Okay. Okay, I will have him re-queue back up. Our next question is going to come from Mike Matson from Needham & Company.", "Mike Matson", "Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I guess I had one on MAKO and then one on the Neurotechnology business. So, just on MAKO, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the hip side of that business and how big of a deal do you think it is to have the Stryker hip family now available on the RIO system? And then just on the Neurotechnology business, I understand the commentary around the standard Trevo product, but how fast \u2013 sorry, have you seen any impact yet, just given the strength of the data that\u2019s come out of those recent studies? And how fast do you think the market is growing neurovascular overall? And do you think Stryker has been gaining share?", "Katherine Owen", "So, on MAKO, clearly having the Stryker power brand, particularly Accolade, which has been very successful on the MAKO robot, we think it\u2019s going to help increase the value proposition at particularly given the small clinical data, we still believe total knee is the biggest market opportunity overall, but we do think we can strengthen the interest level and momentum on the hip side as we add our proven clinical hip line to that products. On neuro, it\u2019s going to take time with the market development. We have seen an increase in volumes in some of established stroke centers but the majority still need to work through a lot of the items that we listed off on the call around being able to have physician alignment, inter-hospital transfers and really making sure they are established as a stroke center and that\u2019s going to take time. So it\u2019s really focused on the longer term potential as well as some additional clinical trials that are underway including DAWN and the SITS Open trial, but those are probably not going to be completed in 2016 or even 2017. So we are building the base of data. MR CLEAN is a great study. I think it reinforces our conviction, but it will take time overall. In terms of the market, if you are talking about the ischemic segment, it\u2019s very healthy growth. But remember the base is still very small here for the device-based treatment of that condition. So while it\u2019s double-digit growth, it\u2019s off of a pretty small base.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. And I think one of the questions you asked was neurovascular in general I would say that the bulk of the business is really on the hemorrhagic side as you know. And we have consistently been taking market share over the past 2 years or 3 years with a slew of different product introductions around our target brand, different sizes, different shapes and that product continues to perform extremely well around the world.", "Mike Matson", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Bob Hopkins", "I am so sorry about the phone difficulties, I apologize.", "Katherine Owen", "We just have really big expectations for this question now Bob.", "Bob Hopkins", "Yes. I am afraid I am not up to the task. So two quick things, first, on the spine side, Kevin at the recent AAOS meeting, obviously this is one of areas where you have expressed a lot of excitement about the portfolio, about the sales force and about the products you have coming down the pike, I was wondering if you could just kind of set them expectations as we look forward as to when you think we could really start to see some noticeable acceleration in the spine business, is that something that you can do organically here over the next couple of quarters or do you think it\u2019s going to take longer?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, as I mentioned before, I am really pleased with our spine business. Certainly, we have a very profitable business. And we have been improving our organic profile. The CoAlign acquisition was a very important one, are providing very innovative products. We have strengthened our management team at spine. And so this first quarter was, I would say a good quarter. I think we are going to start to improve over the course of 2015 and also continue to look at other opportunities to add products, whether it\u2019s through organic or inorganic means over time. But it\u2019s a business that\u2019s going well. The management is in really good shape and I expect this to be a better year than we have seen in the last couple of years.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay. And then lastly I apologize if this was asked Katherine, but did you guys spell out explicitly what sort of buyback is assumed in your guidance for this year, just I think, originally you had said it was just sort of the normal $400 million when you first gave guidance, I am sorry if I missed this, but I just was curious exactly how much buyback is assumed in this new guidance?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. So what we say is at the start of any year we assume some level of buyback activity. And there is a lot of different things that factor into a range, obviously. So we say $400 million, but that could be plus or minus $100 million. And you have seen some years it\u2019s not that and some years it could be higher than that. I think with the open authorization increase, we clearly have the ability to buyback more stock. We haven\u2019t made any explicit changes that you should be assuming a new level because really it\u2019s going to depend on other priorities and how big year unfolds. And it is again why we have a range of $0.15 range and obviously everything else being equal, which won\u2019t be true but everything else being equal, we buyback more stock. It\u2019s going have a positive impact there. But there is no explicit assumption at this point.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay. So there is no explicit incremental assumption in these new numbers, it\u2019s sort of the same as it was at the beginning of year just by the authorization?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. And we think we will use that up over 2 years to 3 years, which, obviously a bit \u2013 it\u2019s a bit lower end of that we are going to have a higher level and hopefully that will translate into a better performance within the range. But there is a lot of factors in that range as you know that can offset things pretty quickly.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great. Okay, thank you very much.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thanks Bob.", "Operator", "Our next question is going to come from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Glenn Novarro", "Hi, good afternoon guys. I had a question on recon pricing, in the press release you called out recon pricing down 3% and I was wondering how is that comparing to your plan, and if you can give us any color on U.S. recon pricing whether it\u2019s above or below the 3% you have in the press release? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Glenn. We breakout pricing on a worldwide basis for the three business segments and you can see that in the press release. We don\u2019t break it down further by geography. Clearly, the greatest pricing pressure is within the Ortho segment at that 3% level. No real change from quarter-to-quarter, it\u2019s all the same trends we have seen \u2013 we have been seeing. I mean pricing got incrementally better for us, but still negative, but I wouldn\u2019t point to any significant change in any of the business segments that would be worth highlighting as it relates to price.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up, once again U.S. foot and ankle, better than 30%, I don\u2019t know how many more quarters you have left and you would keep doing 30%, but maybe talk about the sustainability of that number and in the end markets, I know the end markets can support that, but how much longer can 30% last? Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, thanks. First of all, just to clarify, so if the greater than 30% growth was aided by the acquisition of SBI. So, on an organic basis, we grew around 20, still a very, very impressive number, given the multiple quarters of organic growth that had exceeded 30%. But we are really excited about the potential, we are still penetrating and new markets are very exciting because they are hard to predict. You don\u2019t really know and as you are continuing to penetrate the market where more and more implants are being used. Getting a total ankle, it was a huge move for us. In the foot and ankle market, it was a good gap that acquisition is really just starting to gain steam. So we still think we have plenty of growth ahead for our foot and ankle division.", "Operator", "Our next question is going to come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Some hospitals are reporting better volume in the first quarter of 2015, is that partly what drove the improvement in your Ortho numbers in Q1 and your U.S. hip number was very strong, are you already seeing the benefit from the Stryker Power brand on the MAKO robot?", "Katherine Owen", "I would say we haven\u2019t seen any real change in volumes in the first quarter beyond the normal seasonality that we see. So nothing that has changed dramatically there. And I think it\u2019s too early given when we got the clearance of the MAKO of the Stryker Power brands on MAKO to point to that. As you have seen we have had really good momentum there for a while and I think it\u2019s just the strength of the overall portfolio.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. In the U.S. our hip brands have been growing above market for about 3 years now. So this is a continuation of the strength that we have had over time.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Okay. And then that\u2019s my follow-up. I guess I am wondering if you are seeing anything so far from the Zimmer-Biomet merger or from Wright-Tornier, anything in terms of disruption? Thanks for taking the question.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. Nothing that we would point to, although it\u2019s too early with \u2013 the deals haven\u2019t closed and you typically see that disruption occur later in the integration process. And whether or not that translates into any shares shifts, we are not assuming that. I think we are really well positioned between our portfolio and the MAKO line and the underlying strength that we are seeing in foot and ankle. But I wouldn\u2019t point to any disruption that we are seeing of any significance at this time.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. It\u2019s too early and certainly if there is disruption, we will be well positioned to take advantage of it. But at this point, it\u2019s too early to see anything.", "Operator", "Our next question is going to come from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Raj Denhoy", "Hi, good afternoon. Wondering if I could ask a bit on MAKO, as you get closer to launching that product, the total knee on \u2013 the product in the United States, I am curious if there is anything you can share with us in terms of how you will position that product, what the attributes will be that you will stress the customers, whether it\u2019s better alignment or better efficiencies or just anything that can support the rollout of that product?", "Katherine Owen", "Really the overall value proposition of MAKO hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s built on improved patient benefits and clinical outcomes. And we think we are going to be uniquely enabled to be able to show procedural enhancements and improve patient experience and then improve patient satisfaction. We think with this technology the consistency and reproducibility of the surgery is really going to elevate and allow for greater standardization and better overall outcomes. And then longer term, hopefully next generation of implants that regardless of surgeon\u2019s skill is simply not achievable today with traditional planar cuts.", "Raj Denhoy", "Okay. When asked about kind of the products you are most excited about, I think you highlighted MAKO is the biggest one. And I am not sure if you have ever given us anything in terms of your expectations about what share you could gain or what the product could actually do for your position in the marketplace. Have you \u2013 are you ready to do that or give us anything in terms of expectations?", "Katherine Owen", "No, we haven\u2019t and it\u2019s early, obviously, we don\u2019t have the total knee and that\u2019s going to take time even when it gets approval, it\u2019s going to be a methodical and measured ramp up as we train and educate. Clearly, MAKO is something we are very excited about. The ortho team is very excited about it. But if you really look at the history of Stryker, with all the different businesses and franchises we have, all rolling our products, it\u2019s much more story about singles and doubles and the totality of all those products that drive the organic sales growth. It\u2019s very rarely any one single product that we would point to. And while MAKO has the potential obviously to be a big driver, overall, it\u2019s the totality of that portfolio.", "Raj Denhoy", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on Raj\u2019s question here previously. Can you talk a little bit more specifically about the total knee rollout? I mean, we are getting fairly close I think here to getting that approval. So, once you do get the approval, how do you go out to the hospitals that already have an existing system? Is there an upgrade program that we should expect? I think the installed base is right around 250. And then are you hearing from hospitals at this point right now that are already waiting to see the total knee application before buying the system? And then I have a follow-up.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I think again it\u2019s going to be a very measured launch post-approval. And we are still I mean we filed with the FDA stage and then when we get the clearance, we are going to have to be very measured, we are going to have to train and educate to make sure that surgeon experience is appropriate. We don\u2019t want to mess this up. There is going to be upgrades that have to happen from a software standpoint. So, it is something as we have articulated in the past, it\u2019s going to be a number of quarters before we start to really see the trajectory that\u2019s indicative of us taking market share gains. And nothing has changed with that expectation. What we saw in our due diligence is a range of people. There is the early adopter with any new technology. There is those who want to see more of an established clinical brand of implants and that\u2019s what we are doing as we add the hip power brands, for example. And then there is those who want to wait and see more indications. So, I am sure there are surgeons out there who want a total knee before they really are going to be convinced to go the robotic route. And that\u2019s just indicative of the various ways of technology adopters you see both with the robot or any new technology.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Fair enough. And then for my follow-up question, the Trauma and Extremities business continues to be quite healthy, that selectively is around a $7 billion category growing mid to upper single-digits. And I think your sales force is pretty established here. You have a full portfolio of products in both areas. Is this some \u2013 is this a category where over the next kind of 5 to 7 years you could essentially double your revenue base here?", "Katherine Owen", "So, your market estimates on a global basis for Trauma and Extremities are ballpark. And we are really pleased with the performance we are doing there. I don\u2019t think we want to get into that type of multiyear projections in terms of the revenue potential. But clearly, we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing, the ability to consistently take market share. And we think that\u2019s going to remain the case going forward.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. I would see this as we see with Neurotechnology, Sports Medicine, Trauma and Extremities, these are really growth businesses for Stryker, and they have been for multiple quarters. And I think in the years ahead, we are going to continue to focus on them. If you think about upper extremities, we are still a relatively small player in upper extremities. And for us, that\u2019s an exciting area for the next few years. There are established players. It\u2019s not like foot and ankle, which is a brand new market. But for us, there is plenty of room to grow in the upper extremities space and even with some of the products we acquired through the SBI acquisitions, we think we are well-positioned there. So, for us, it\u2019s definitely has been a great business for the past multiple years and we continue to see that as an exciting growth business in the years ahead.", "Operator", "Our next question is going to come from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead with your question.", "Kaila Krum", "Hi, guys. This is Kaila in for Ben. Just back to the MAKO commentary and understanding the seasonality of the business, but recognizing the pretty steep sequential step-downs from the fourth quarter, can you just talk about the cadence of those capital sales during the quarter and if you are hearing about any material interest following AOS?", "Katherine Owen", "So, it was clearly a big part of our booth presence and the focus and the excitement that we saw at AOS was around MAKO, which is great to see, because it obviously reinforces our long-term conviction. We have been in the capital business for a long time with our MedSurg businesses and see a very similar pattern, where you have strong year end capital sales as hospitals are looking to use up budgets and then the appropriate drop off in the first quarter, so nothing about that sequential decline surprised us. And I think it should really be reflected in expectations going forward. Now, it\u2019s not always going to be perfectly aligned with what we saw this year, but it\u2019s pretty indicative of the pattern of capital sales.", "Kaila Krum", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then with respect to your efforts around ICG, can you touch on any \u2013 some of the product specifications of the system, how it might be differentiated in currently available technologies and how do you plan to approach the marketplace with this device?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. So, I am not going to get into a lot of details as we haven\u2019t yet launched the product. It will be launched probably in the next 6 to 12 months sometime in that timeframe. But what I can tell you is it\u2019s going to be integrated into the light source that we have and that that will be a huge advantage versus having to purchase additional capital. And if so, we probably feel very good about and it will integrate exactly right into our light source, be very convenient, it will obviously be lower cost than having to purchase extra capital. And it will operate as you would expect, it will light up the common bile ducts that we will see very clearly as you are doing your dissection that you won\u2019t be able to have any kind of injury. So, it\u2019s a safety play. We are very excited about it, but again, we haven\u2019t launched it yet. And more details will become available as we get closer to the launch.", "Operator", "Our next question is going to come from Bruce Nudell. Please go ahead with your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good afternoon. This is Matt on for Bruce. Can you hear me okay?", "Katherine Owen", "Hi, Matt.", "Unidentified Analyst", "I was wondering can you elaborate a little bit on the supply issues in Instruments and MAKO as far as \u2013 in Instruments, what products were affected and what sort of caused the disruption and what gives you comfortable that you are back on the market when you think you are?", "Katherine Owen", "Normal supply issues, there is nothing significant that we would call out that was of major concern, which is while we have visibility in terms of the supply returning around that related to our power tools, we should have that resolved to allow for a much stronger performance with respect to Instruments in the second half of the year. With MAKO, it will be largely resolved or will be resolved during the second quarter.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, but I would think about this more like a back order and back orders happen in our industry a lot. So, it\u2019s not like we are off the market, it\u2019s just that we don\u2019t have to be a supply that we normally have people to fully meet our customer orders. So, that\u2019s why when I \u2013 in my prepared remarks I talked about this really being a delay. And so back orders, that typically happens as you lose the sales for a period of time, but you don\u2019t lose the sale to another company, the sale just gets delayed. And that\u2019s what we are experiencing in the Instruments area as well as MAKO.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thanks. And just one follow-up. Any updated thoughts on competition from lower cost offerings in hips, knees, trauma, are you seeing any change there, any increased traction, and do you see that as a significant threat this year or down the line based on what you have seen so far?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, I wouldn\u2019t go beyond this year. We are always going to be watching and watchful, but I\u2019d say for this year at least thus far this year, we haven\u2019t seen any change whatsoever related to either trauma or our reconstructive division and don\u2019t expect to see much or at least over the course of this year. We are always going to keep an eye on it, but thus far, no change whatsoever.", "Operator", "Our next question is going to come from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Josh Jennings", "Hi, good evening. Thanks a lot. I just wanted to start off with Japan business and give a little bit more color on the improvement in Q1 that you experienced. And as you annualize the ERP implementation challenges next quarter, can you quantify at all the headwind from Japan that goes away throughout the rest of 2015? And how meaningful is it to the international recon growth?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. So, we obviously don\u2019t provide all the details by country. What I can tell you is Japan really did turn around in all of our divisions, except for Reconstructive. So, Reconstructive, given the surgeon relationships does take a little longer to sort of gain that business back, but I was very encouraged with Trauma, with Spine as well as our MedSurg businesses. The ERP systems are all resolved. We are regaining share slowly. But I would expect that certainly by the third quarter we should be back to kind of the same level of market share that we had in the past. And so I am really pleased with how the new management has approached the challenge, like I say, in Spine and Trauma, ahead of schedule, recon is going to take a little bit longer.", "Josh Jennings", "Great. And just on the medical unit, it\u2019s been a big driver of growth for MedSurg business, can you just talk about the organic growth rate for that unit and what\u2019s driving that and is it \u2013 is the bed replacement cycle a major component of that and capital allocation by hospitals moving away from IT? Thanks a lot.", "Katherine Owen", "So I would say there is a small component because we did the acquisition...", "Kevin Lobo", "CHG?", "Katherine Owen", "Earlier in the year, but...", "Kevin Lobo", "It\u2019s early in the year, but it\u2019s largely organic growth, virtually all of its organic growth.", "Katherine Owen", "And I think it\u2019s very reflective of just the strength that we are seeing in the capital markets right now. We feel good about this because it\u2019s been several quarters of them really outperforming how much of that is a shift of dollars out of IT priorities, it\u2019s very difficult to get that level of granularity. What we would say is we do feel good about the momentum that we are seeing in capital across the board. The supply issue is notwithstanding because clearly we were seeing the demand there.", "Operator", "Our next question is going to come from Jeff Johnson from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good evening, just two quick questions here. One, just on the knee business, U.S. knee business kind of two quarters in a row in the flat to up 2% range, anything specific contributing to that, competitive launches or anything else or how we should think about your U.S. knee business maybe over the next few quarters?", "Katherine Owen", "I wouldn\u2019t point to anything specific that we are seeing in that business that was clipped modestly as we mentioned by the MAKO supply issues. But there is nothing major that we are seeing in the market are different on the competitive front. Obviously, you haven\u2019t seen everybody report so far, but nothing that we would call out.", "Jeff Johnson", "Okay. And then on the spine implant said, it sounds like that number was maybe a little bit better than fourth quarter, any changes in the end markets there, anything you can talk to on pods or payer pushback or anything, is that continuing to get a little bit better or is it still hard to tell on that front?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. To me it seems like a very stable market, our performance is starting to improve. And that\u2019s what I think I spoke just earlier on the call that our management team and some of the products we have launched in the MIS space where historically we had less presence in MIS. It\u2019s starting to help us gain momentum. So it was modestly better in the first quarter and I would expect that trend to continue.", "Jeff Johnson", "Understood. Thanks guys.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is going to come from William Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.", "William Plovanic", "Great. Thanks. I just have a financial question for Bill, just what is the normal share dilution per year that we should think of with options coming into the model without share buyback, just normal?", "Bill Jellison", "Yes. So I mean, based on the numbers that Katherine was talking about, I mean we would need maybe a third of that kind of level, maybe a little bit more I guess then to offset the dilution that\u2019s occurring at the same time from the share issuances?", "William Plovanic", "So if I take your share issuances, what does that breakout into number of shares annually roughly without buyback, just what\u2019s added normally?", "Bill Jellison", "It is probably \u2013 I mean it\u2019s only \u2013 it\u2019s just a few million.", "William Plovanic", "Okay, that\u2019s all I had. Thank you very much.", "Bill Jellison", "It\u2019s not much associated with that.", "Kevin Lobo", "It\u2019s pretty small.", "William Plovanic", "Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2015 results will be held on July 23. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Adrienne and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO, and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide updates on MAKO, neurovascular and our Transatlantic Operating Model. Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.", "The second quarter results underscore the momentum we are seeing across our three segments as we leverage strong sales and marketing execution and realize the benefits from both internally developed products and acquisitions. We are focused on growing organic sales at the high end of MedTech and this marks our ninth consecutive quarter of achieving organic sales growth of at least 5%.", "Our strong U.S. businesses which represent about 70% of our sales had stellar growth of over 9% led by double-digit growth from medical, trauma and extremities, neurotechnology and instruments. Medical and trauma continue their excellent performance and neurotechnology has been bolstered by new clinical data that Katherine will discuss. Instruments had a nice recovery from Q1 as much of their product [indiscernible] issues have been resolved.", "Our U.S. Spine business was also a bright spot posting 9% growth in the quarter. We are encouraged about the growth of recent product launches such as AccuLIF from the CoAlign acquisition and have a robust pipeline of new products that will be launched over the next few years. This product flow when combined with the strength in management team positions Spine well for the future.", "Outside the U.S., our performance was largely consistent as strength in Europe and a continued improvement in Japan was offset by some softness in other markets including parts of our China and Latin America businesses.", "Looking at the P&L, the establishment of our European regional headquarters and related tax benefits are tracking ahead of our expectations. As previously conveyed, we are reinvesting roughly half of our tax savings to support our new structure within Europe, which is reflected in the year-over-year increase in SG&A.", "Our strong top line, disciplined expense management and better than expected reduction in tax resulted in adjusted EPS of $1.20, which was the upper end of our $1.15 to $1.20 range that we targeted heading into the quarter. We expect our first half momentum to continue including an improved tax rate, and consequently we are raising both our full year sales and adjusted EPS targets to 5.5% to 6.5% and $5.06 to $5.12 a share respectively.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. The focus of my comments today will be on providing an update on MAKO, progress with our Transatlantic Operating Model or TOM as well as some comments related to our neurovascular business. Starting with MAKO, we placed 13 robots globally, representing a Q2 record. This follows a Q1 record level of nine and a Q4 2014 record of 20 robot placements. Of the 13 in Q2, we placed two in Australia which represents our first sales in this key market for Stryker where we command a market-leading position in hips and knees.", "During the quarter we initiated robot upgrades which will enable Stryker hip implants to start being used on the robot in Q3. The upgrades to the installed base will continue throughout 2015 and into next year. As you are aware, our Total Knee 510(k) application was submitted to the FDA late last year and we have responded to the agency's questions with no current change to our target for clearings in 2015.", "Shifting to TOM, with the completion of Q2, we are six months into our new Transatlantic structure and are pleased with the progress we are making to optimize our European presence. We continue to invest in this initiative through a portion of the tax savings and all of our key leaders and commercial structures are in place. We continue to see improving top line momentum in Europe and believe we are well-positioned for further acceleration particularly as we head into 2016.", "Finally, the European regional headquarters represent the flagship for our presence in Europe as we bring [HCPs] [ph] into this site for training and education. We believe this will be key to strengthening the Stryker brand in Europe and enhancing our relationships with physicians at hospitals.", "Lastly, I will make some comments relating to our neurovascular business. As Kevin mentioned, we like the momentum in neuromuscular space and the recent update of AHA/ASA guidelines are one of the multiple drivers to market expansion. We expect to see similar guidelines coming from Europe and Japan. Specifically in June for the first time, the AHA recommended that patient should receive endovascular therapy with a stent retriever for the treatment of ischemic stroke which represents the vast majority of the roughly 800,000 strokes that occur annually in the U.S. alone. These guidelines represent the first new stroke treatment in two decades to win AHA's strongest backing.", "The usual treatment of an ischemic stroke is to administer a clot dissolving drug known as tPA. However, the drug must be given within 4.5 hours after symptom onset. With stent retriever, the clot can be quickly removed in the patient to restore blood flow to critical vessels in the brain. Late last year and earlier this year several major studies including the MR CLEAN study found stent retrievers dramatically cut the risk of death or disability in patients whose clots persisted after treatment with tPA. The new AHA guidelines recommend patients be treated with a stent retriever if it can be done within six hours of symptom onset and if they have a severe stroke caused by a clot in a large artery.", "Clearly the mounting clinical data and support from AHA underscore the opportunity for endovascular treatment of stroke. However, it's important to note that much work needs to be done to further develop the market, including the optimization of EMS transport systems and inter-hospital transfers, protocols and hospital infrastructure and investment in the human and physical capital to absorb the patient volume. Stryker remains committed to continuing its investment in stroke innovation with the recent launches of Trevo 6mm, 3mm and the 40/30 or long Trevo, this combined with further clinical studies such as the DAWN trial for late and wake-up stroke patients.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Bill.", "William R. Jellison", "Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was 2.9% in the second quarter including a negative 4.7% impact from FX translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7.6%, which includes organic growth of 6.9%. EPS on a GAAP basis for the second quarter were $1.03 per share versus $0.33 per share last year in the second quarter, while adjusted EPS were $1.20 per share for the quarter versus $1.08 per share in the second quarter of last year.", "This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.07 per share from FX, in line with our original guidance. Most foreign exchange rates were again weaker against the dollar than last year in the same period. The weaker euro and Swiss franc along with our layered hedging program helped to mitigate some of the impact in the quarter as many of our products are manufactured within Europe.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter relate to a charge of approximately $112 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II, offset somewhat by a favorable legal settlement with Zimmer Biomet. The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions become more refined.", "Looking at sales in the second quarter, our organic growth of 6.9% was comprised of a positive 8.7% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 1.8 percentage points. Acquisitions added 0.7%, while FX had a negative 4.7% impact on the sales in the quarter.", "Looking at our segments, Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of orthopaedic products were up 0.6% as reported and grew 6.2% constant currency and increased 5.3% organically. U.S. orthopaedic sales grew 8.3% in the quarter. Trauma and extremities had another standout quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 18%, reflecting approximately 30% growth in our U.S. foot and ankle business, including strong double-digit organic growth.", "U.S. hips continued its strong performance and grew 5.7% in the second quarter, while U.S. knees increased 2.8% against a tough 7% comp last year. Internationally, sales were a positive 1.1% in hips in constant currency and increased 5.3% in knees in constant currency.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 3.9% as reported with 7.4% in constant currency and increased 6.7% organically. These results were led once again by double-digit organic and constant currency growth in our medical business as our sales force combined with a strong product offering continue to execute.", "We also experienced upper single-digit constant currency growth in instruments as we restored shipments from a supply issue which negatively impacted the first quarter. Endoscopy grew by 3.2% in constant currency against double-digit organic comps in the second quarter last year.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 19% of our sales in the quarter, increased 6.4% as reported and 11.5% organically. Growth in this segment was led by strong double-digit growth in each of our Neurotechnology businesses including neurovascular, CMF, and NSE. Spinal implant sales increased mid-single-digit in the quarter and high single-digits in the U.S. as new products energised the business.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the second quarter of 2015 were 66.3%, compared to 65.9% in the second quarter last year. The increase in the margin rate in the quarter compared to the second quarter of last year resulted from negative pricing pressures which were more than offset by favorable mix, FX and operational efficiencies. Pricing declined 1.8% in the quarter, in line with our expectations of approximately 2 percentage point decline.", "Research and development expenses were 6.3% of sales, slightly lower than last year in the quarter. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $879 million or 36.1% of sales in the quarter versus 35.3% in the prior year period. The cost increases were driven in part by our decision to reinvest roughly half of our tax savings to strengthen our European selling and marketing activities and support our new European regional headquarter. We also incurred higher compensation cost including commissions tied to our stronger sales performance, partly offset by improved cost controls in many of our indirect spending categories.", "Adjusting for these items on a year-to-date basis, we would be delivering leverage of 30 to 40 basis points and we are confident in our ability to deliver at least this level of expense leverage in 2016 as we continue to drive a number of key initiatives in this area.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 23.8% in the second quarter of 2015, nearly flat with the second quarter of 2014. The rate reflects solid operational improvements coupled with favorable mix, largely offset by our investments to support our European business, negative price and compensation cost tied to our strong sales performance. Other expense in the second quarter was approximately $30 million, which is flat with last year in the second quarter.", "Our reported tax rate for the second quarter was 2.2 percentage points, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 16.8%. This compares to a 22.4% adjusted effective tax rate in the second quarter last year.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $4.3 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately a third of it held in the U.S. We also had $3.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended in the second quarter at 55 days, slightly below last year's second quarter, and days in inventory finished the quarter at 173, just a little better than the 177 days in the second quarter last year.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first half of 2015 were $737 million compared to $579 million last year in the first half. Capital expenditures were $114 million in the first half of 2015 compared to $124 million in the same period last year. However, capital expenditures are expected to run higher than last year as we move through 2015.", "We expect significant cash outflows associated with our Rejuvenate settlement in the second half of this year with a major portion of the funding occurring in the third quarter. So far in the third quarter we have paid out $786 million and we expect to fund a total of approximately $1.2 billion this quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is expected to be sourced from OUS cash.", "Also, as we previously mentioned, we have repatriated approximately $700 million in the first half of the year and expect to repatriate nearly $1 billion more late in this year. We still have over $2 billion available for share repurchase under our recently expanded authorization, as approximately $324 million of share repurchases were made by the end of the second quarter. We will continue to evaluate the level and frequency of our share repurchases. However, current plans are to fully utilize the current authorization over the next two to three years.", "Our strong second quarter results give us additional confidence in our ability to deliver improved operating results for the year. We are increasing our guidance for both sales and earnings for 2015. Our sales guidance now includes constant currency growth of 6.5% to 7.5%, with organic sales growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect the net sales for the full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 3.5% to 4%. Pricing pressure will continue and prices are currently expected to be nearly 2% declines for the Company moving forward, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced over the last year.", "The benefit from the renewal of the tax extenders continues to be in our year-end earnings guidance and represents approximately $0.05 per share for the year. We continue to expect that they will once again be approved. However, we do not expect them to be renewed until late in the year. As such, we do not have any benefit from them in our actual results or our planned earnings guidance until the fourth quarter of this year.", "We also expect that our adjusted tax rate will run at or below the level achieved in the first half of the year and will be noticeably better in the period the tax extenders are approved. Based on current FX rates, we expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.25 per share for the full year. Keep in mind that the full year negative impact of foreign exchange rate movement is largely driven by the translational component of FX which we do not hedge.", "And finally, we are also increasing our earnings guidance for 2015. Our adjusted net earnings per share is now $5.06 to $5.12, with adjusted net earnings per share in the range of $1.20 to $1.25 for the third quarter of 2015.", "Thanks again for your support and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, callers will be limited to one question and one follow-up question. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "Congrats on a really good quarter. So just two things I want to touch on, one for Bill and then one for Kevin. First, Bill, one of the questions that we've gotten pretty consistently from investors relates to your ability to drop through operating margin leverage and I know you made the comment about 30 to 40 basis points of drop through, so was that an SG&A or an operating margin comment and is that the kind of leverage you want us to expect you to be able to deliver as we look forward?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. That comment, Bob, was specifically on our SG&A component and we wanted to just make that clear because we're making some nice reductions within that area currently. However, as you can tell, that's obviously being masked by a couple of things this year and we wanted to highlight that. I think also as we relate to 2016 comment, we're highly confident in our ability to create that leverage, but again that's just at the expense level and we'll talk more broadly about our operating income levels as we give our regular guidance. But you should expect and you're seeing our gross profit margin improvement currently show up and as I mentioned earlier this year, we should have better comparables against gross margin as we move through this year. And so if we're getting any level of gross margin improvement, which we believe should be flat to a slight positive in a more neutral FX related environment, along with some of the SG&A related leverage that we just talked about, you should expect leverage at the operating income line as well moving forward.", "Robert A. Hopkins", "Great, thank you. And then for Kevin and Katherine, obviously you're seeing some clear strengths across your businesses and as you think about capital allocation, does the strength of your business change at all, how you think about capital allocation priorities, does M&A remain the top priority, if you could just speak to that how this [clear strength] [ph] in your business might be impacting your thought process there, that would be helpful?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Thanks Bob. Our capital allocation strategy is unchanged and we still have M&A as our first priority and use of cash and you can see based on the activities done over the past couple of years, they are contributing to our esteemed organic growth performance because after the anniversary of the first year then they become part of our organic business, and we still see significant scope for acquisitions within the three segments that we planned to date. So that continues to remain number one and as we've mentioned previously, dividends we intend to have steady increases at least as fast as our earnings growth, potentially a little bit faster than that, and then share repurchase is the more fungible one which really varies depending on the timing and the flow of deals which as you know is inherently uncertain. But no change to our strategy, the strength of our business frankly reinforces the strategy that we've been deploying over the past few years.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David R. Lewis", "Kevin, what I find interesting about this particular quarter, if we look at various segments that you were enthusiastic about at AOS, namely spine, neuro and MAKO, they've all come through and frankly I think most would agree have come through faster than most were expecting, so I think it would be helpful, based on your earlier enthusiasm, what's sort of your conviction on a continuation of the trends you're seeing here in the second quarter in those key businesses, spine, neuro and MAKO?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So I feel very good about all three of those businesses. Neuro has been a trend we've seen frankly for multiple quarters and it's now being accelerated because of the ischemic stroke segment that Katherine mentioned which will be a multiyear journey, and that was based on the Concentric acquisition which we did in October of 2012. So neuro has been really a continuation of a multiple quarter experience.", "On MAKO we turned the corner really about the midpoint of last year and you've seen sustained improvement and I expect that to continue. We're of course very anxious for the Total Knee approval which we believe will be another catalyst for enhanced growth, but our organization really has embraced this, the sales force integration is now really humming. So we're feeling very, very good momentum and excited. We got over our back order issue that plagued us a little bit in the first quarter, we were able to get through that on MAKO in the second quarter, so feel good about that.", "Spine really is the one business that's turned the most and the most recently, and I'm really encouraged because it's based on a combination of product launches and numerous product launches. If you look over the past two years, we've launched more than we did in the past four years. If you look in the first half of this year, we've launched more in any six-month period than we've launched probably in the last three, four, five years.", "So we've really gained momentum, we have new R&D leadership that has an exciting flow of products, and of course we've added some acquisitions as well with CoAlign, with the BIO4 biologics. So we have a number of products and the product flow going forward I feel very good about, and as you've seen in spine, innovation is rewarded and you grow through innovation in new products and that's a truism across large and small players in spine. So the innovation is alive and well in spine and our management team has been strengthened over the past year or two. So I feel very good about our prospects of spine going forward.", "David R. Lewis", "Okay, very clear, thanks Kevin. And maybe just a deeper dive, Katherine, on MAKO, I think what's interesting is that business has basically gone up every quarter last four to five quarters. This particular quarter you doubled MAKO installed systems year-on-year but we still haven't seen a significant impact from either product approvals on hip or potentially obviously the knee in the latter half of the year. So what is driving the momentum in MAKO? Is it simply a sales reorganization focus or are we starting to see the enthusiasm for existing approvals and the approvals coming obviously in a few months?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say, David, it's more the former as we've got the integration challenges that we had early on last year behind us and the team is really working together in leveraging the considerable breadth and depth that we bring along with the MAKO expertise. We are in the process as I mentioned around doing the necessary software upgrade that will enable us to start to put our hip implant on the MAKO. We have the clearance but we have to do that work and that will continue through this year and into next year as well.", "And then the knee indication, we are looking to get that clearance hopefully sometime in 2015, it's in the hands of the FDA. But keep in mind it is going to be three, four quarters before we've gone through the necessary training and upgrade and work that's going to be needed to be done to make sure that that launch is truly optimized. So I would make sure to just consider that it will not be a light switch when we get that indication. It clearly enhances the value proposition of having a robot, but it is going to take some time to make sure we really optimize that launch.", "Operator", "The next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David H. Roman", "I was hoping we could come back to the neurovascular business. Understandably, Katherine, in your comments you talked about the need for training and development and educating the market around the new guidelines, but if we look at the numbers that your key competitors put up in their most recent quarter as well as the step-up we saw in your business today, it does look like the market was sort of ready to get moving here. So maybe you could just help us think about how we should size this opportunity on a go forward basis and whether the growth rates we're seeing now are reflective of something sustainable or some type of pent-up demand waiting for clinical data and new guidelines?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think that there are some well-established in the minority stroke centers that were well-prepared for this clinical data that we're expecting it to be positive but they had done a lot of that market development and had the patient inter-hospital transfers and the various work that needs to be done completed. So they were good to go but that does not represent the majority of places where patients would need to go.", "So I think you're seeing an early benefit but there really is going to need to be a lot of market enhancement work done between us and others as well as additional clinical data. So we feel really excited, the data is truly compelling and the impact that this can have on patients is just it's clear that these devices have a very clear role to play, but it will take time for this to be broadly applicable with all stroke centers which is what we're trying to signal.", "I think it's too early for us to size the market up. We'll just have to see how this plays out on paper with roughly 80% of the 800,000 patients who have a stroke being ischemic and get to some very big numbers, but I don't think we want to get too far ahead right now until we've got some more time to see how the market develops and the neurovascular community embraces the data and the market development work.", "David H. Roman", "Okay, and maybe just secondarily, and another question on MAKO, I think Kevin one of the things you talked about at AOS was your different ways to sort of get the capital out there and target some of the Biomet accounts. Could you just maybe talk about how any sort of the changed commercial strategy may be impacting the business today and any opportunities that may arise out of the Zimmer Biomet transactions, some of the divestitures that were required for completion there around Unis?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "I'm not exactly sure I follow your question there. Just so in terms of relating the Unis the Zimmer Biomet to MAKO, is that your question?", "David H. Roman", "I think as one of the divestitures required for FDC clearance was some of the Zimmer Uni product, so are you seeing any disruption in the market thus far that would provide an incremental opportunity for MAKO associated with that transaction?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "I would say it's really too early. I mean this deal is just closing right now. We haven't seen much of an impact there. The MAKO already had a very sizable portion of the Uni market as it was and certainly every time there is a change, any type of acquisition, whether we're doing an acquisition or whether someone else is doing an acquisition, as the companies integrate there usually is opportunity. So we'll see how that plays out but right now it's too early to say. It really didn't impact this quarter, that's for sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Kristen M. Stewart", "I was just wondering if you can just reconcile the change in guidance just in terms of the EPS. I know that looks like FX is a little less negative relative to where you were guiding previously. I think in the first quarter you had said it was going to be a $0.25 to $0.30 headwind. I think the tax rate went down and the organic growth went up and you're reinvesting a little bit. So maybe just help me understand some of the moving parts just in terms of where numbers are going, how much of it is organic moving versus reinvestment and so forth?", "William R. Jellison", "Kristen, this is Bill and I think that as far as our overall guidance is concerned, we've obviously had some positives on a number of fronts. I mean our sales and operations are doing very well, we've increased our top line sales guidance obviously. Taxes obviously also a little bit better than our \u2013 quite a bit better as well than talking about earlier, at least for the street, and then as far FX is concerned, that might be $0.01 or $0.02 better for the whole year than what was there. But I think that there's also on an ongoing basis there's a lot of other dynamics that are in the marketplace as well that we need to make sure that we're taking into account and it's truly the combination of all those positives and negatives that we're looking at.", "Also keep in mind on the tax side that we have stated all year long that we've been expecting to reinvest about half of that which is what you're seeing in kind of the SG&A side. We have been expecting that investment upfront in the year and so that's also reflected in the numbers that you're hearing.", "Kristen M. Stewart", "Okay. And then, so I guess the best way to think about it is, if not for the reinvestment, you guys would have clearly \u2013 I guess what would've been the underlying operational EPS growth if not for the reinvestment?", "William R. Jellison", "Keep in mind on the reinvestment, [talk] [ph] to the reinvestment is actually to support that overall project which is running through the SG&A and other part of it is what we've talked about upfront with our Transatlantic Operating Model and some of the additional support that we want to be putting in our sales and marketing efforts, especially within Europe, and I think that we're also already seeing some at least positive motivation in activities around that move at this point and we expect that that's got a multiyear benefit for us. And as we talk about kind of the leverage that we've got with our underlying operating expenses, we believe that we're actually delivering that already this year and that's why we're also committing to some level of that at least externally as I mentioned on the call earlier.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "I think, Kristen, this is Kevin, just wanted to underscore what Bill said, so a good portion of the reinvestment is establishing that European structure and there's cost related to that. So the tax benefit, it's not like a one-time event that's a windfall. This is like remapping our transactions, creating a structure, creating this headquarters. There was a significant amount of cost involved in creating that. Of course it's driving significant financial benefits through the tax plan and those benefits will be there for years to come. So this for us is an investment that is clearly paying off but it is directly related to each other and it's not that the tax area is just a windfall and comes for free. There was a cost associated. It appears on two different lines of the P&L, but net, it's a huge positive for us and one of the contributors to our raised guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Michael N. Weinstein", "So let me start off, I'll pick up actually and maybe push a little bit on the guidance as well, if I went back to really the tax discussion, it goes back to the analyst meeting right last year and that's when you disclosed that it would be a couple of hundred basis point benefit from the European setup and that you were going to invest half of that, but since the start of the year the tax rate guidance has come down by what would basically imply say about 350 basis points, so that's like $0.20, and then initially the FX headwind was $0.30 and now it's $0.25. So that's $0.25 of kind of incremental call it less headwind or call it incremental tailwind for you guys and you've raised the bottom end of the range by $0.16 since the start of the year but you've only raised the top end by $0.02. Are you putting earnings away at this point for a rainy day? Tell us just, reconcile the math I just walked through versus how much you've raised guidance so far this year.", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. Mike, I think one point to make is really around the tax rate side of the equation and we in taking a look at kind of the expectation this year, we clearly knew that it was going to be a better than 2% impact for this year. From a directional perspective to the street, we wanted to give guidance to say that it was a meaningful improvement but we really didn't fully like identified that until we saw that run through our number. We wanted to commit to it. And just like with our investments that we were doing within that area, same thing. We were spending a certain amount of money upfront that we knew we were comfortable with but we also were holding some back and making sure that we wanted to see that realize through our earnings statements before we really are releasing that.", "But our total expectation for the project is in line and which was the commitment for us to reinvest half of that total savings back into the business, both to support that structure which was pretty significant to support the change in the structure that we have within Europe, but then also to really ramp up some of our sales and marketing activities there.", "Michael N. Weinstein", "Okay. So the answer is, you are not putting earnings away for a rainy day, and I have one follow-up so the operators don't cut me off, but just talk for a minute about U.S. spine because obviously this is the best quarter in a while and just would love to hear your thoughts on it.", "William R. Jellison", "Mike, so just getting back, so for our guidance, obviously the guidance is really for our operational performance and so things \u2013 when we give our third quarter guidance, that's where we believe our operational range will be for the third quarter. Of course if the tax changes, we've now after six months of our original headquarters, we've now got a very good view of our tax rate. So you're not going to see as much volatility in our tax rate in the third and the fourth quarter. You can be much more reliable. As you enter a new structure like this, there's a lot of unknowns. We worked through those unknowns in the first half of the year, so now we're feeling a lot better about that. So you won't see as much volatility as we saw in the first six months and we do try to guide around what's going to happen operationally and then of course things like FX and unknown things happen over the quarter that can move us up or down within the range.", "On spine, so it's been a while in the works, right. So we hired, I mentioned I think at academy a year ago, not this year but the prior year that we had hired a new spine R&D leader and re-established a real focus on innovation which had been lacking in our spine business, and we've launched a lot of products in the first half of this year and we have a really robust pipeline. So product flow is I would say number one issue. We also have enhanced some of our management team in spine, stabilized the sales force, and so we really have a good offense. We were running a very profitable business before but we weren't growing very fast and we've now turned on the engine of growth really behind new products. And it's not something that I see as a one-hit wonder. Of course each quarter is dynamic. This is one good quarter. But I do see a sustained path for good results for multiple quarters going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matthew C. Taylor", "I have a couple of questions I guess, one was just, if I look at the pricing in Recon, it actually got a little bit better this quarter, it was the best it has been in I guess six quarters. So I wondered if there was any real change there or if that's just within the range of normal variability?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would put that in the range of normal variability. It can bounce around in the 10s of basis points. So obviously it's better when it improves or it's less negative, but I wouldn't point to any change or difference in what's going on in the market.", "Matthew C. Taylor", "Thanks. And have you seen any disruption from the ongoing combinations at your different ortho competitors and maybe just comment on how you're seeing such strong growth in trauma and foot and ankle.", "Katherine A. Owen", "We haven't really seen any impact from the Biomet Zimmer merger recognizing that. It had just recently closed. So we'll see how that plays out. We're certainly not going to underestimate them as a competitor. They are two formidable organizations but we are also very focused on continuing to drive growth and execute on MAKO. And then on trauma and extremities?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Just on trauma and extremities, this has been a multi-year story, right. So if you look at 2012, 2013, 2014, each of those years in the U.S. we grew at least 15% and based on the first half of this year it's safe to say it looks like we're going to deliver another 15% or more growth. So that's four years in a row. So we've just seen sustained performance. Foot and ankle has been a huge contributor to that, that continues to grow extremely well and it's a little bit like the stroke market Katherine is talking about, it's been a market development story, so kind of hard to predict. It's frankly exceeded our expectations when we created the foot and ankle business unit but that's a team that knows how to perform, it's been performing consistently year after year. So we're excited. We still have a lot of room for growth in upper extremities. So while we're very pleased with our performance, it's not that we've reached the end of the growth opportunity. We're still actually a smaller player in upper extremities and we see that as potentially exciting area for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Glenn J. Novarro", "I wanted to just follow up on pricing in light of what CMS announced with respect to this pilot program on bundling, we've been getting a lot of incoming questions about does this put pressure on price longer-term. So my first question Kevin is, what are your thoughts on this whole bundling project?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So what we saw with the initial pilots on the bundled payments is we really didn't see any different dynamic in pricing. So the price pressure we expect will continue as it is currently. Once they start to focus on the total episode of care in a bundled payment, they tend to make much more focus on post-acute costs, which frankly outpace the cost of an implant. So we see this as a trend that really doesn't disrupt the implant pricing. We'll have the same pressures we had before. If anything, it might start to drive them to rationalize towards less suppliers of implants. In that world, we like that kind of consolidation to us is an environment where we feel we're well-positioned to win. So to us this is a dynamic that we've seen in pockets and we haven't seen our business adversely affected by a move to bundled payments. It's like I say, the post-acute costs are very significant and once they're shown in spotlight that's where I believe more of the focus will be placed than on the implant cost. That's not to say the implant costs are not immune from price pressure, but I don't see it as a new catalyst.", "Glenn J. Novarro", "Got it. And then just on medicals and other, it was a very good strong medical quarter, and I just wonder if that's a function of the favorable CapEx environment that we're in today or is it a function of your new product cadence or maybe both?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would attribute it to both. The medical group is doing a great job executing on product launches, some of which you may have seen at our product fair in June. The environment is stable, it's inherently volatile as we've seen over the years, but the outlook is very stable right now is how I would characterize CapEx, particularly for medical.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Richard Newitter from Leerink. Please go ahead.", "Richard Newitter", "First question for Bill, you mentioned the 30 to 40 basis points of SG&A leverage in 2016 and you said flat to positive gross margin leverage in an FX neutral situation. Can you just describe what kind of pricing dynamics or decline, what's the threshold at which maybe it's flat to negative?", "William R. Jellison", "Sure. So that obviously relates to the gross profit margin piece of it and from that perspective we still are expecting about a 2 percentage point price decline level. As we've talked about before, as you're in that kind of 2% level, we believe we can get a normal kind of FX related environment. We believe we can still keep margins flat and actually hopefully still improve them slightly based on kind of all the cost initiatives that we have in that area. If pricing improves and is like 1.5%, we've talked that that actually creeps up to maybe into the 20 to 40 basis points of improvement level, and obviously if it goes north of 2% that also has a more negative related impact. But again we see prices pretty much in line with where we are this year which is right in that 2% range.", "Richard Newitter", "Okay, that's helpful. And then for Katherine, the total knee on the MAKO solution sometime in 2015, should we be thinking that when you do in fact get approval there, even though we might not see it in the actual kind of implant numbers for knees and the growth rates there, should we expect some sort of step-up in your ability to play systems, are there customers for whom the value proposition will become that much more apparent?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Without a doubt those customers who are going to see greater value in the robot with more applications and the total knee is the biggest one. I have no doubt there are some who have waited and I'm not sure I would necessarily model some step function change or bolus, this is a tough business to model, but it clearly strengthens the value proposition, but really the real driver will be a few quarters out once we start to do the upgrades and see more and more traction. So I think in theory it makes sense, I think we'd be a little bit hesitant to get too aggressive and modeling any type of step function change.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Rajbir S. Denhoy", "Just wanted to ask a question on spine business, when that business was not performing well, there were lots of questions about whether you would want to do an acquisition there to perhaps jumpstart the performance. I guess my question is, as you've now seen a resumption in performance and you've described it as kind of being longer-term or at least having some durability, does that change your view on that business and really how much, how long you'll wait for it to grow, if that makes sense, I apologize?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think the way we continue to view it as clearly M&A is the primary use of our cash as we've talked about, we have dedicated BD people in all of our divisions who are actively looking at targets and that's the reason why we were able to identify CoAlign and seen the benefit of that product from that acquisition. So they are always going to be out looking at ways to augment the portfolio, but first and foremost we look to invest in the business and build it organically. And so we're never going to rule out acquisition targets in any area and they're going to vary in size. As you know most of ours tend to be relatively small to midsized targets but those BD people will continue to look at market opportunities.", "Rajbir S. Denhoy", "I guess as that business performs better, do you have more patience in a sense for it, or do you still feel like you need to do something to it, because I guess you described wanting to be bigger in that business longer term?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I don't want to speak to any specific division. We said we're focused on our core and key adjacent markets and spine is one of them but we also do a lot of relatively smaller deals that I'm not going to rule out continuing to augment our portfolio. We do that when businesses are performing well and we continue to invest in them. So there's no deviation or change in the overall strategy. Each deal will stand on its own merits but I wouldn't want to single out any one division and say they are off the BD market for any period of time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jason H. Wittes", "Just a couple of follow-ups. First, the reinvestment that you're doing in Europe, can we assume that that's finite period, I mean basically just through the end of this year or how long will that reinvestment period run through?", "William R. Jellison", "So the investments that we are actually making there would be investments that would occur on an ongoing basis but off of the same level, right. So we're investing about half of that tax savings this year but you should think of that just a normal step-up for what we're doing within the European side, but as we're moving forward we would expect to grow that new base level and leverage it as well against our sales growth as we would anything else, and that's why we wanted to reiterate that you should expect to see at least that 30 to 40 basis point of improvement in the SG&A line category for next year. [Indiscernible] like a one-time investment, this is an investment that changes the base of business moving forward.", "Jason H. Wittes", "Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on Trevo, I think Katherine based on your comments, it sounds like the large stroke centers have pretty quickly picked up on the data and have changed their practices but if you start going to more regional or smaller centers it's unclear whether they are moving in that direction just yet. Is that the right way to think about what is going on in the marketplace right now?", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, it's going very well with established stroke centers that are very sophisticated and who are ready to go. I think a lot of those other stroke centers are waiting for data to be a catalyst to say we have to start to do this work, and this data that's come in like MR CLEAN and will be coming in is certainly that catalyst but it takes time. If you think about that laundry list of market development items I mentioned, those are not something that will happen in a quarter or two, it will be a few years but it's clearly supported by the data that I think will prompt many of those to start to make those changes in investments.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham. Please go ahead.", "Mike Matson", "I guess first of all I just wanted to see if the selling days this quarter were the same as the year ago quarter.", "Katherine A. Owen", "Yes, there's no change in selling days.", "Mike Matson", "Okay thanks. And then I know it's a smaller deal but I was just wondering if you could comment on the [indiscernible] medical acquisition that you did.", "Katherine A. Owen", "We are excited about that. The medical group is clearly excited about it. We had a relationship with them, a distribution agreement going back to 2012. The company has been around for nearly 50 years, a private company based out of Turkey, and they've done a great job. They specialize in the design and manufacture of hospital beds and structures and they've been primarily serving the Turkish market around eight countries. So it's a great opportunity for us to build a presence in that segment with a premium value product. We know them well, so we are comfortable with where they are located in their manufacturing facilities, and it really helps to further strengthen our portfolio longer-term. So it's a small deal, [indiscernible] very modest, not material incremental sales but clearly a great product franchise to further bolster what medical is doing.", "Mike Matson", "And are those products intended to be sold globally or is it more for the European markets or emerging markets?", "Katherine A. Owen", "It's primarily for the Turkish and surrounding countries as well as some in Latin America. Longer-term we'll wait and see what direction we're going with this but you should not be thinking about that as a near-term U.S. product offering.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Lawrence H. Biegelsen", "So just starting with neurotech, so we understand that a lot of physicians prefer to use an aspiration device with a stent retriever, do you guys have any plans to introduce your own aspiration device and if so what's the timing, and I have a follow-up?", "Katherine A. Owen", "One of the great things about neurovascular, both the hemorrhagic and ischemic side, is there is so much opportunity for innovation and you've seen that over the last few years with technologies coming out and we have a very robust pipeline on the R&D side. I'm not going to get into specifics at this time around which products and the timing of them, but I will say we're very comfortable as one of the market leaders here and with the talent in our R&D team, we are well-positioned both with our current portfolio and future generations of products that we'll be introducing, but I'm not going to get any more specific at this time around timelines.", "Lawrence H. Biegelsen", "I understand. And then Kevin, you mentioned some softness in China, can you talk about what you're seeing there? And just very quickly, Bill, on the tax rate, I'm a little confused what tax rate to use this year. I mean last quarter you said less than 20% but it's like trying to get about 18% in the first half without the R&D tax credit.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "I'll start with the China question. So we saw a really good performance with our implant business. Where we saw the slowdown was in capital equipment. We saw that quite sluggish in China in the second quarter and we even saw in Latin America also the issues that we had were more pronounced in capital equipment than in our implant business.", "William R. Jellison", "And associated with the tax rate question that you asked, our year to date operating tax rate is about 18.1%, and as I mentioned in the call script, we're comfortable with a rate for the full year at or slightly below that. Keep in mind as you mentioned the tax extenders are not in that number yet. So when the tax extenders are ultimately approved, hopefully by the fourth quarter of this year, in that period you will actually see the tax rate dip down again in that one period obviously but because that would be a full-year benefit of those extenders being picked up in the fourth quarter, but for an average rate for this year we would expect to be a little bit below what our average trend rate is right now and I think that that's relatively a consistent tax rate that you can project for next year as well.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matthew OBrien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Matthew OBrien", "Kevin, as I look across the businesses, it looks like the performance is quite strong across the platform but it seems like it's more volume driven than anything that we've seen historically the last couple of years I should say. Is that a function of benefiting from things like ACA, the deferrals in CapEx that are now kind of coming through and then AHA guidelines in neuro, and is that something that you feel comfortable being able to smoothly transition through or lap as we get into next year some of those benefits not being as much of a tailwind?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So it's hard to generalize because every division has its own story. So if you look at trauma and extremities and the performance there, that's a lot of innovation, creating a new business unit for foot and ankle. So I think each division has its own story. The overall tailwind around capital equipment is undeniable and I think you see that in the marketplace. So that's been a real positive. But if you look at our instruments division as an example, even before the tailwind they were really performing at a very, very high level and double-digit growth kind of performer and getting Neptune back on the market and growth there.", "So I feel really strongly about all of our divisions' leadership, their innovation pipeline, looking at the way they look at acquisitions, I get a chance to go around and visit with every division and we strengthened our leadership in many areas and we have very, very strong positions. So we were growing faster than the market when the markets were a little bit down. Now the market is certainly moving up in the capital equipment side and we're taking full advantage, but you can see even in an area like medical that's done two deals just in the past year, they are smaller deals but they are adding to the innovation that they are doing organically and innovation wins. And so when the market is good, you see the numbers are buoyed but I'm not worried about as we get into comparatives that are a little bit higher that we can sustain strong growth.", "Matthew OBrien", "Okay, very helpful. And then as a follow-up question, just looking at the environment that we're in right now with extremely low interest rates and robust equity markets, I'm just curious on the asset side of things. You've done a couple of smaller deals recently but are the valuations that are out in the marketplace right now for some of the larger acquisitions, even midsized acquisitions targets getting to the point where it just doesn't make sense or you are unable to meet your internal hurdle rates with some of those assets, and if that's the case, are you willing to, given the environment, adjust your internal hurdle rates?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I would say clearly valuations have moved up. We are always confronted with challenges around valuations, sellers' expectations even in an environment that hasn't been quite as strong as recently. So it's always going to be a factor that we've got to consider, it hasn't changed our priority around M&A but it certainly does become an issue on some deals and that does impact the numbers we look at. At this time there's no change in terms of \u2013 sorry, the second part of your question when you talk about our hurdle rates and returns, we're pretty disciplined and the approach we take there we think that makes sense.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joanne K. Wuensch", "Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but briefly in China you made a number of investments there over the years, I remember Trauson very well. Do you have the footprint there that you want to have?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "Overall, we still have a long way to go in China. I would say the Trauson acquisition was a great deal for trauma and spine and we're expanding in China. We are still about to launch in India, so we don't sell Trauson yet in India. We're launching that in the second half of this year. We are still waiting for approvals in Brazil. We will launch that next year. So I think Trauson has a lot of room to grow outside China. Inside China I'm very pleased with that but we don't yet have lower-priced hip and knee offering. That's something that you could see in the foreseeable future, that's something we'd want to pursue.", "We're not still covering all of the territories in China, so we're continuing to grow our sales force in some of the more remote areas where we still don't have access. So we've been growing our China business very strongly over the past five, six years in both the premium segment as well as the lower-priced or mid-tier segment, but we still have a long way to go. I would say that the market potential in China is still very significant.", "Right now obviously you're hearing a lot about the China slowdown but I think within healthcare we still believe we have a lot of room to grow, and certainly on the MedSurg side that's been an area of the endoscopy business, it's been a very strong business but our other MedSurg businesses don't yet have a very, very strong footprint in China. So we still see a lot of opportunity and we are learning a lot about the mid-tier segment and Trauson was our first foray into that segment and figuring out how to win in that marketplace with other products is something that I see maybe not the next year but in the next five years as very important for Stryker. So we still have a long way to go.", "Joanne K. Wuensch", "I appreciate that. As a follow-up, one of the areas or one of the ways that spine has grown is investment in the sales force. Is there a way to qualitatively talk about how much larger that sales force looks like today versus 12, 18, 24 months ago?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "In which country, sorry? Oh, she got cut off, I'm sorry. The question was in China, so we obviously use a distributor network in China and we have a separate set of distributors for the Stryker premium business and a separate set of distributors for the mid-tier segment. And what I mentioned to you is we've got very good coverage in the big cities and in some of the surrounding areas but pushing to the western part of China we still have room to grow and that will largely be through expanding the distributor network. So it's not so much about direct sales force, it's more about making sure we have the right distributors to cover the rest of the country.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.", "Joshua T. Jennings", "I just wanted to start on MAKO, Katherine you mentioned two systems placed in Australia and maybe if you could just give us an update on plans for OUS launches in other countries or are we getting ahead of ourselves?", "Katherine A. Owen", "I think it's going to continue to be dominated by the U.S. robot placement. Australia is a market where as I mentioned we have very strong market positions in both hips and knees. So it's a market that made a lot of sense but I think as you go forward I would really focus on U.S. is going to be the primary driver of the placements.", "Joshua T. Jennings", "Just in emerging markets business, pardon me if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk about \u2013 you talked a lot about China but just other avenues within emerging markets where you are in terms of your trajectory this year and actually in the first half of 2015 and any initiatives you can to accelerate your emerging market growth?", "William R. Jellison", "So I would say after China, which has been a really strong market, our strongest emerging market is China at Stryker, after that I would say I'm really pleased with our progress in India where we're growing very, very well from a small base admittedly but we're having very good performance starting from last year in India and it seems to be very sustained growth.", "The other priority market is Brazil and Brazil obviously is going through a pretty tough recession right now. We also had some issues where we had to change one of our spine dealers in Sao Paulo and that caused a bit of an issue in our spine business, and so we have that from time to time in Brazil which represents roughly half of Latin America. So Latin America is for the future very important for us and we're quite a small player, but I would say this year because of the recession in Brazil, it's not going quite as well as it has in the past couple of years but certainly an important market in the long term.", "Areas like Russia and Turkey are actually doing quite well but you can imagine those are not exactly the most attractive markets, at least at the moment, but those are the other two emerging market countries that are going to be a top priority for us, but we are measuring our investments. We had planned, if you look back maybe three years ago we were planning to really invest more vigorously in Russia and Turkey and given the macroeconomic conditions there, we have tempered our investments in those two countries.", "But clearly it represents about 8% of our sales at Stryker emerging markets and we would like that number to be much higher but the conditions have to be right and we want to make sure we get a good return on our investment, but those are a couple of markets that are doing very well and there are other ones that I think we're going to be a little bit more measured in the pace of our investments.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Plovanic. Please go ahead.", "William J. Plovanic", "First on the foot and ankle, that's grown really well for you. Would you say that you're creating the market with procedural kitting or do you think that's more taking share from existing players in the foot and ankle piece?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "With the kind of growth we've had over the past few years, I would say the bulk of it is market development, but you can't grow at this kind of rate without taking some share. So I'm sure we've taken some share along the way but this has been really more about a new market story where we're getting people that weren't using implants to start to use implants. That's been the biggest engine of growth within foot and ankle.", "William J. Plovanic", "Okay. And then on MAKO, as you place these systems and that's reaccelerated, is this based more on an alternative financing method or are these kind of direct sales?", "Kevin A. Lobo", "I would say we have a flex financial unit within Stryker that provides various options to make capital easier to acquire and we have used that for some of the sales of the robot. But frankly though the vast majority have been direct purchases thus far, so the hospitals are finding the capital and they are [pruning] [ph] it up but we do have an arsenal of, a range of options for them to choose from, and I think going forward \u2013 certainly Europe is an example, as we start to expand MAKO in Europe I think using financing will be much more prevalent than it is here in the U.S., but in the U.S. they've been, the vast majority have been direct purchases.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the [second] [ph] quarter of 2015 results will be held on October 22, 2015. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, the participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question.

Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K, filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "(01:20 \u2013 01:25) 2015 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO, and Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, and Bill will then offer details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.", "Our Q3 results represent the tenth consecutive quarter of delivering a minimum of 5% organic sales growth, which reflects the strength of our diversified model and our commitment to achieving revenue gains at the high end of MedTech. Once again, all three business segments delivered year over year sales growth, as continued strong momentum in the U.S., which represents approximately 70% of our sales, more than offset modest constant currency gains outside the U.S. This performance was notable given the tough year over year comparisons in MedSurg.", "Top-line standouts in the U.S. included trauma and extremities and neurotechnology, which continued their string of double digit growth. I am also pleased with our U.S. performance in MAKO, hip, knee and spine, which are all showing good momentum since the beginning of the year; and despite tough prior year comparisons, instruments and medical continue to perform well. Katherine will discuss MAKO in more detail, which included another strong quarter of robot sales and FDA approval of the total knee application.", "International markets proved more challenging, as softness in China and Latin America offset strong performance in Australia and Europe, the latter which is benefiting from the launch of our Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of this year. Building on our success in Europe with this new structure, we have recently announced changes to our leadership model in other regions of the world. These changes will be effective in 2016, and will drive stronger engagement with the regions and our product divisions. We believe these changes will enable us to accelerate international growth over time, although we do expect the market conditions in emerging markets to remain challenging into 2016.", "Turning to the P&L, we drove leverage through improving gross margin, ongoing focus on G&A and a lower tax rate, owing to the establishment of our European regional headquarters. As a result, we have been able to continue to make key investments in R&D and sales and marketing to help sustain our top-line momentum while ensuring we are achieving our financial targets.", "Our adjusted EPS for Q3 of $1.25 represents an increase of approximately 9% versus prior year, which is at the high end of our targeted range of $1.20 to $1.25 a share. With three solid quarters now complete, we are well positioned to meet our full year sales and revised adjusted earnings guidance.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on MAKO, with a particular emphasis on our planned rollout of our triathlon total knee on the MAKO robot. Firstly, with respect to the quarter, we sold another record level for Q3, with 17 robots globally in the quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 41. These robot sales represented a nice mix of existing and competitive accounts, while also reflecting both direct purchases and lease agreements through our Flex Financial Group.", "Looking at the total knee, recall that we received FDA clearance in August for this key robotic indication, which we believe will drive considerable differentiation in the reconstructive market. Momentum continues to build for the MAKO total hip and the Uni has gained considerable market share. Beyond these indications, we have a high degree of conviction regarding the opportunity for the robot with the total knee, which we anticipate will enable us to drive market share gains following full commercial release.", "Against that backdrop, we wanted to provide greater visibility regarding the launch of the total knee, as we focus a significant amount of our time and effort on the front end to enable an optimal physician and patient experience. Given the anticipated impact of the total knee, we are committed to extensive training with our 1,000-plus sales force as well as our surgeon partners. We also will look to collect data that will further strengthen the value proposition as we analyze the ability of the robot to positively impact a number of clinical and economic outcomes.", "The initial phase of our launch, which will get underway late this year, will target a small group of existing robotic users who represent the key opinion leaders in the surgeon community. This will help drive a database of outcomes that will allow for a presence at key podium presentations beginning in 2017. We will also target current non-robotic surgeons who are also KOLs and have extensive experience with our triathlon total knee. By observing outcomes for both groups, we will be able to enhance the training protocols prior to full market launch. A broader market release will get underway in the second half of 2016, setting the stage for full commercialization as we head into 2017. Note that beyond this critical training and stage release, there is considerable support being provided as we upgrade the existing robots in the field to enable for total knee placement.", "In sum, we're committed to leveraging our leadership in reconstructive surgery to help ensure that this transformative technology for total knee replacement has an optimal rollout, while setting the stage to collect key data that will further validate its value. As we have stated previously, our approach to market launch will limit the revenue impact for this indication in 2016. However, we anticipate we will be on a path to demonstrating market share gains in total knees beginning in 2017.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Bill.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Katherine. Sales growth was 1.3% in the third quarter, including a negative 4.6% impact from foreign translation. Constant currency sales growth was 5.9%, which includes organic growth of 5.3%. EPS on a GAAP basis for the third quarter were $0.79 per share versus $0.16 last year in the third quarter, while adjusted EPS was $1.25 per share for the quarter versus $1.15 in the third quarter last year.", "This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.06 per share from FX, in line with our guidance. Most foreign exchange rates were again weaker against the dollar than last year in the same period. The weaker Euro and Swiss Franc along with our layered hedging program helped mitigate some of the impact in the quarter, as many of our products are manufactured within Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rate in the period. However, significant currency weakening within the emerging market regions and general weakness in the Japanese Yen, Australian and Canadian Dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter relates to a charge of approximately $149 million associated with the voluntary recalls of Rejuvenate and ABG II. The charges for the Rejuvenate matter may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and assumptions more refined.", "Looking at our sales in the third quarter, our organic growth of 5.3% was comprised of a positive 6.6% from volume and mix, while price negatively impacted sales by 1.3%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 4.6% impact on sales in the quarter.", "Looking at our segments, Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter. Sales of Orthopaedic products were up 0.3% as reported, and grew 5.8% constant currency, and increased 5.5% organically. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9% in the quarter, despite facing tough comps in all three of our Orthopaedic businesses.", "Trauma and Extremities had another standout quarter with sales in the U.S. increasing 15%, including Foot and Ankle organic growth of nearly 20%. U.S. Hips continued its strong performance and grew 5.7% in the third quarter, while U.S. Knees increased 5% compared to last year. Internationally, sales were a negative 0.4% in Hips in constant currency, and increased 0.2% in Knees in constant currency, resulting from tougher macro market issues in China and Brazil.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 39% of our sales in the quarter. Total MedSurg sales increased 0.6% as reported, with 4.1% in constant currency, and increased 2.8% organically. These results include mid-single digit constant currency growth in our Medical and Instrument businesses, as we begin to go up against strong double digit sales growth periods. Endoscopy grew up by 1.4% in constant currency, as customers await our new camera launch late in the fourth quarter.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, which represents 19% of our sales in the quarter, increased 5% as reported, and 9.9% organically. Growth in this segment was led by strong double digit growth in Neurovascular and NSE. And CMF increased high single digit, and Spine sales increased low single digit in the quarter, including mid-single digits in the U.S.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margins on an adjusted basis in the third quarter of 2015 were 66.9%, compared to 65.7% in the third quarter last year. The increase in the margin rate in the quarter compared to the third quarter of last year resulted from favorable FX, product mix and operational efficiencies, partially offset by continued pricing declines.", "Research and development expenses were 6.4% of sales in both the third quarter of 2014 and 2015. Selling, general and administrative costs on an adjusted basis were $862 million, or 35.6% of sales in the quarter versus 35.3% in the prior year. The increase was driven in part by our decision to reinvest roughly half of our tax savings to strengthen our selling and marketing activities and support our new European regional headquarter. We are confident in our ability to leverage these expenses again in 2016, as we continue to drive a number of key cost initiatives.", "Operating margins on an adjusted basis were 24.9% in the third quarter of 2015, compared to 23.9% in the third quarter of 2014. The rate reflects strong gross profit rate, partially offset by the impact of negative price and our investments to support our European business and sales team.", "Other expense in the third quarter was approximately $33 million, which includes higher net interest expense and FX transaction losses in the period.", "Our reported tax rate for the third quarter was 12.8%, while our adjusted effective tax rate was 16.4%. This compares to a 19.9% adjusted effective tax rate in the third quarter last year. The tax rate this quarter brings our adjusted rate to 17.5% on a year-to date-basis. We still expect the extenders to be approved late in the fourth quarter; however, if not approved, it would negatively impact our full-year per share earnings guidance by $0.03 to $0.04 per share.", "Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $3.4 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 30% of it held in the U.S. We also had $3.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the third quarter at 56, consistent with last year's third quarter, and days in inventory finished the quarter at 187 days, slightly higher than the 182 days in the third quarter of last year.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations in the first nine months of 2015 were $228 million, compared to $1.1 billion last year in the first nine months. Capital expenditures were $191 million in the first nine months of 2015, compared to $172 million in the same period last year. As mentioned last quarter, we did make significant payments this year associated with our Rejuvenate settlement of $1.2 billion, most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from the OUS cash.", "Also, as we previously mentioned, we have repatriated approximately $700 million in the first nine months of the year and expect to repatriate nearly $1 billion more late in the year. We still have approximately $2 billion available for share repurchases under our expanded authorization, as approximately $446 million of share repurchases were made in the first nine months. We continue to evaluate the level and frequency of our share repurchases. However, current plans are to fully utilize the current authorization over the next two to three years.", "Our strong third quarter results give us additional confidence in our ability to deliver improved operating results for the year. Our sales guidance continues to be constant currency growth of 6.5% to 7.5%, with organic sales growth in the range of 5.5% to 6.5%. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales for the full year of 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately 4%. Pricing pressure will continue and prices are currently expected to be down 1.5% to 2% for the company moving forward, relatively consistent with the pricing environment we have experienced over the last year.", "We expect that our adjusted tax rate for all of 2015 and in 2016 will be in the 17% to 18% range. Also keep in mind that the potential benefit from the renewal of the tax extenders continues to be in our year-end guidance, and represents approximately $0.03 to $0.04 per share for the year.", "Based on current FX rates, we still expect 2015 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.25 per share for the year, and again keep in mind that the full year negative impact of foreign exchange rate movements is largely driven by the translational component of FX which we do not hedge. And finally, we are narrowing our earnings guidance for 2015 to $5.07 to $5.12.", "Thanks again for your support, and we'd be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time. Moderator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. As a reminder, callers will be limited to one question and one follow-up question.", "The first question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit more on the Orthopaedic trends that you're seeing in the United States. It was a very good quarter across the board for the business and particularly within the Hip and Knee franchise. Just wondering if you're seeing early benefits just from MAKO and just being out there and talking through having the system, or if you're seeing just kind of any acceleration in the market or just some disruption from some competitors that are out there? Thanks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kristen. This is Kevin. Look, we're very pleased with the quarter, both in Hips, Knees, as well as MAKO. I would say that the team has done a terrific job in driving organic growth within Hips and Knees. Hips you've seen for the last three years we've been driving terrific performance. We're very pleased with the Knee momentum that we're seeing, and I think we got a bit of a shot in the arm with the launch of our cones, our 3D-printed cones for revisions. But it's been momentum building throughout the year. It's just really strong leadership, strong execution. The robot sales, of course, help. I wouldn't say that we've seen much in the way of disruption, so this is really more just driving organic growth and really building throughout the course of the year.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then just in terms of the comments for outside the United States, with some disruption between China and Latin America, any level of visibility in terms of when that would turn around? Or, I guess just \u2013 for now \u2013 just expect that to continue into 2016? I guess that's the takeaway.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, in my opening remarks I mentioned into 2016. I don't have a crystal ball, so it's really difficult to predict when the macro conditions will improve. We referred to capital equipment being particularly tough last quarter. We did see that spill over into implants, with distributors starting to lower their inventory levels, and we really don't have great visibility into how long it will last. I think it will certainly continue through the fourth quarter and into 2016, but it's something we're going to have to update you on as each quarter unfolds.", "Kristen M. Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "But Europe is turning around with the help of the Transatlantic model?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Europe had a terrific quarter. A really excellent \u2013 we're in the sort of mid-single digit growth in Europe, and overall, you know Europe GDP is not growing at that rate, so we're very pleased with our performance in Europe and expect that to continue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Kevin, I wanted to come back to SG&A for a second here. I think incrementally, across the year, I feel like the company has talked about more material opportunities for SG&A reduction. Can you give us a sense of what that opportunity is, perhaps the size of the opportunity, when we could hear more about it?", "And a related question for Bill \u2013 what's a reasonable level of leverage we can expect sort of going forward here at this level of sales? I think last quarter you told us maybe 40 basis points. What's an appropriate level as we think about 2016?", "And I had a quick follow-up for Katherine.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, all three of us. So I'll start. David, we've been working all year on plans around SG&A. We've taken a number of measures already, and we're working on evaluating some more significant measures. We still have significant scope for improvement in SG&A. We've talked before about the fact that we have very little in the way of shared services. We have many IT systems across our disparate organization.", "So there are significant opportunities. I'm not yet ready to quantify that and discuss that with you. Once we reach that stage, we will definitely tell you. We will be very thoughtful, as we were with GQO. We gave you a five-year road map with the amount of savings planned over that five-year period. You should expect to hear something like that related to SG&A, but we're just not ready yet and I don't want to speculate on exactly when we'll be ready to communicate. But work is ongoing, and it will be something you will hear in the not too distant future.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "And just as a general comment associated with the leverage expectations, pretty consistent with what we were talking about before. So if you're seeing kind of this mid-single digit sales growth, we believe we can grow our broad based operating margins kind of in the 20 to 40 basis points, 30 to 40 basis points range on an average basis over a three- four-year period of time. I think that that's pretty consistent with our expectations, and if you look at where that should come from, price is a key factor. So as we mentioned in the past, as price is kind of still up close to around the 2% range, we'd expect very little improvements at the gross margin level, and most of that would really be taking place through the SG&A related leverage. If price is 1.5% or less, which we don't expect \u2013 we expect it to be in the 1.5% to 2% range \u2013 but if it was less than that, we would expect to be able to drop some through at the gross margin level. And obviously if the price went above 2%, then we think that that could cause some detrimation (23:57) to the overall gross margin rate, but the operating margin rate would still be able to provide some level of leverage.", "Next year, on the SG&A side of the equation, as we talked about before, this year we had heavy investments for both the RHQ structure to support our tax and some of our new sales and marketing related efforts with the TOM model, but we do expect to get good leverage out of the SG&A category next year to be able to deliver on those results.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, great.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we can.", "Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good afternoon. First question, Kevin, I just wanted to follow up on the emerging markets. Interesting that you'd see it spill off into implants. I know you don't have a lot of visibility, but what's your best estimate right now from what you're hearing from the field in terms of why this is happening? Is it simply just the economies over there or just any other color would be appreciated.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I mean what we're seeing is \u2013 certainly in Brazil \u2013 it's a market slowdown, complete slowdown in the market, and that's obviously the biggest country we have in Latin America, and so it's both capital equipment as well as implants. In China, we saw capital equipment slowing down earlier in the year. This quarter, we saw implants starting to slow down. And it really, as far as we can tell, is related to macro concerns, and the distributors are just nervous. They're worried about their cash flow. And so, it's not something that I think will continue indefinitely, but it's something that we saw, certainly in certain parts of our business. We see it in Spine and Trauma more acutely than we saw it in Hips and Knees, but it was pretty broad based, and that's something we'll continue to monitor. But I don't have great visibility, honestly, into how long it will last.", "Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then the second question. Kevin, I'd love you to comment on capital allocation. We haven't seen a lot of deals from you guys. Just talk about the environment there. And then also if you don't mind, just talk about your confidence as you look at your business going forward into next year, confidence in being able to continue to grow the top line in that 5% to 6% area. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, thanks, Bob. First of all I'll start with the second part of your question. I feel very good about the health of our business overall, with the one exception of the emerging markets, which I think will continue to be difficult. If I look at just across our businesses, the management teams we have in place, our ability to execute, we've had 10 quarters in a row of at least 5%, and I do believe it's sustainable. Like every year, in 2016 we're going to have our share of tailwinds and headwinds, but \u2013 and we'll give our guidance in January as you know \u2013 but I feel very good about our execution, our management teams and our ability to consistently deliver strong sales growth.", "Now, related to \u2013 what was the first part of the question \u2013 on capital allocation? I would tell you, you know that all of our divisions have BD people that are out looking at targets. I would say there are plenty of targets that are out there. We haven't closed very many deals, at least, not as many this year as we have in the past couple of years. But that's not a function of lack of targets. It's just making sure that the valuations work, and that the deals are going to be value-creating for Stryker. So as you know, M&A is difficult to predict in terms of timing, but we do feel that there are a significant number of attractive targets out there and our teams continue to work on that. And that does continue to be our first priority in terms of using cash.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan, please go ahead.", "Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks, guys. I just want to follow-up on some of the questions that have already been asked. So first question would be can you peel the onion a little bit more on the OUS performance? I mean, you've talked about Brazil really slowing down, and Europe, you said, was still mid-single digits. Do you have any geographic breakdown, whether it's developed world versus emerging markets or Europe versus Latin America versus Asia? Any other insight you could give us? Because U.S. looks great this quarter, obviously with the Ortho business. International barely grew, so some more color there would be great.", "And then the second point of follow-up, you talked about the 20 to 40 basis points of expected annual margin expansion. I just want to be clear. Is that what our expectation should be for 2016 or do you think you can do better than that next year based on what you're working on? Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Hey, Mike, it's Katherine. I'll take the first part of the question. International really was very much driven in terms of the headwinds we were facing by China and Brazil, and it was really an extension of some of the trends that we saw in the second quarter. With China, it was capital has been challenged there, given that's government self-pay, but with some of the pull-back we have seen that impact the implant business as well. And then in Brazil, with the country in a recession, that has impacted that business. So really outside the U.S., it's very much China and Brazil that are pulling down the numbers. Europe, with the Transatlantic Operating Model, we're really seeing very good momentum. I think Kevin cited the mid-single digit growth we're seeing there, and stronger performance in other geographies like Japan and Australia. So really, I would say it's very much isolated to the emerging markets of China and Brazil. Bill, do you want to?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Sure, on the operating margin side of the equation, as I mentioned before, we are generally comfortable with kind of that 20, 40 basis point improvement moving forward. We think our businesses are structured in a good way to deliver that. A key part of that is based on price and also based on our top line sales growth. Kevin mentioned, or alluded to, at least, being comfortable with kind of something in the same type of sales growth range, even for next year. If we deliver in that type of a range, we would still expect to get reasonable operating margin leverage off of that. We have not given any guidance, obviously, for 2016. We'll have to take a look at kind of where FX is as well as the markets are at that point in time, and we'll give better guidance with our next call.", "Michael J. Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, Bill, just one follow-up to that. So just on FX, do you have a sense at this point, assuming no change in rates, what the FX spillover would be to the bottom line next year? Like, what incremental headwind you'd have in 2016 to earnings versus 2015?", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah, I'd say that right now based on where current rates are at, we would only expect maybe somewhere in the $0.05 range of a negative impact for next year, but again, it depends on where rates change over the next quarter on what we look at and when we give our guidance. But that's probably a reasonable range at this point.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good afternoon, everybody. Back to MAKO, Katherine, you talked about opening current new accounts. You came in a couple of systems better than I was looking for. And just in talking about the new accounts, it's early I know, but can you give us a little perspective? Are these new accounts impacting share? Are you seeing pull-through? How/when do we start to see that? And I assume that MAKO should have another good fourth quarter. I assume you expect fourth quarters to be typically normally seasonally strong.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, with all of our capital businesses, the fourth quarter tends to be the strongest quarter and MAKO would be no exception on that matter, so we would expect a solid fourth quarter. I think it's just too early. Clearly, the Knee indication has sparked a lot of interest in the clinical community and there's a lot of excitement around it. But I think at this point, how early we are in starting to roll out and in fact that we're in really the training stages, and not being in full commercial release until late next year, it's just too early to say. I think what you're seeing on the organic Hip and Knee performance in the U.S. is a lot of good execution, certainly bolstered by MAKO, but MAKO isn't having the impact, for example, on our Knee or Hip momentum that we would expect to see particularly with the former as we head into 2017.", "Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "All right. And, Kevin, maybe my second one for you, can you talk a little bit more, give us a little more color on some of your comments today? You talked about some of the OUS. leadership changes. Can you maybe give us a little more detail about some of the specific changes you're making, some of the specific marching orders you're giving the new team? Where you've done these things I think they've had an impact. What are you looking for and what results should we expect over the next year or so?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so what we've done and we announced during the quarter that we are phasing out the role of the Group President of International. So that's a role that Stryker's had for a long time, and we're eliminating that position. And as a result, the other regions are going to report directly into our businesses. It's a big change for Stryker. It's going to enable us to be much more closely connected, to have the regions very, very closely connected to our product divisions. That's what we saw as the key benefit with Europe. I could tell you that movement in Europe is ahead of our expectations. And so, this is a natural evolution of this Transatlantic model. We knew that we wanted to get Europe done first. We had the biggest opportunity for share gains are in Europe. That did accompany some investment. We don't necessarily feel that we need to make the same degree of investments in other countries, but we saw the benefit of that region to product connection, and we know that that'll also drive value in other markets of the world.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Matt Taylor from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi. This is actually Yong Lee (33:50) in for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess regarding MAKO, a strong system number this quarter. Just wondering what's the breakdown between purchase system versus financing?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "We don't break out the mix, although I would say it's still dominated by purchases, but there's a decent component of leases as well. And that's really aided by our Flex Financial Group that's been around for a number of years now and exists throughout all our capital businesses within MedSurg as well as Ortho.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. Great, thanks. And on Foot and Ankle, the growth is strong, nearly 20%. Is that largely market growth or are you starting to take some share?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say that the market continues to be a very attractive segment. We're doing well in the market. We're very pleased with the SBI acquisition we did a year ago, which rounded out our portfolio. But you've seen over the past three years, we've been experiencing great growth. I would say it's primarily market driven, but in some cases we are taking market share. But I would first look at the market as being the major driver.", "Unknown Speaker", "All right. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt Miksic from UBS.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we can.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yes.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks for taking our questions. So a couple of follow-ups on some of the topics that folks have hit on already. One, MAKO, you talked about the uptick in Hip and Unis. Maybe Katherine, or if you could talk a little bit about what kind of traction maybe? Any color you can give on the kind of traction you're seeing with Hips? And I have one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "I would say just reflected, and as we continue to place more robots sequentially, you're seeing the impact it's having with our very large sales force out there, articulating the benefits of using a Hip in both robotic. They don't need to establish a lot of credibility in market share in Uni so the gains there are less significant. But in Hips, having our sales force well into the integration now being able to articulate the benefits has really helped drive that adoption.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Any impact of some new software or new applications? I know you're probably on version two or three or four now in terms of the system. Anything there that's starting to make things a little easier for folks? Or any color?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, I think any time we do any improvements, it certainly helps. But I think the biggest factor is having our considerable sales force obviously much, much larger in size out there, aligned and coordinated with their MAKO counterparts, going into hospitals. And those are both our own customers, as well as competitive accounts, and being able to place a robot and then drive the adoption obviously with Uni and Hips. And then as we go forward, the economic value proposition only improves as you start to layer in the Knee.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And then on Spine, appreciate the Q&A and access last week in going through some of the new products. The business is still obviously not, I would assume, where you want it in terms of growth perspective. What can we look for there in terms of catalysts to sort of get that moving? Is it launches? Is it sales force? Is it strategic activity? Any color would be helpful.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, we're really pleased with the momentum that we're seeing in the Spine business. And that really is several years of increased investment in R&D. We have a terrific R&D leader in there, who I think you saw last week at NAS. We've launched something like 10 new products in the last six months. That's more than we've launched in the last two years, collectively. And we have a nice pipeline of new products slated to be launched as we're going forward, so we're going to focus on R&D, driving innovation, and optimizing the sales force and that's all the things that the current leadership is executing on. So, that will be the focus. There's no magic bullet here, but we're going to continue to look at that and clearly pleased with the impact some of those products are having.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, certainly you've seen the numbers in the U.S. pick up and we're encouraged about the U.S. We have work to do outside the United States. A lot of those products have not yet been registered. We haven't launched many products including the CoAlign acquisition, which has given us a shot in the arm in the U.S. We're just working through all the manufacturing transition into Stryker. So, the product tail does lag a little bit outside the U.S. We have work to do there, and certainly OUS was also impacted by the slowdown both in China and Brazil. So, not pleased with the OUS results, but very pleased with the momentum in the U.S. and as we launch those products outside the U.S., I would expect the OUS business to pick up.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets.", "Joanne K. Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one has to do with cross-selling amongst your portfolio and what you're seeing in terms of being able to leverage your Orthopaedic as well as the other areas. And then the second question has to do more broadly with any changes at the CMS level for the pilot program for bundled payment, what you think that may or may not impact your business. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I'll take the first question. I would say cross-selling is something that we do wherever we believe that the customer is interested in dealing across our businesses. So the area that we tend to see this the most is in Neurotechnology, where our customers will express an interest for a Neurotechnology offer, and then our divisions will then work together collectively. So it's generally in response to a customer request. It's not something that we do proactively and that we're pushing from the center. It's really in response to customer needs. But our divisions work extremely well together. Katherine cited an example of Flex Financial which is a unit that sits inside of our MedSurg group that helps MAKO sell robots within our Orthopaedic group. So collaboration does work very, very well at Stryker, but it's something that tends to be very based on customer needs, and not pushed from the center.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "And then, Joanne, with respect to your second question, I would say that since this is really not new to the industry, really more moving over the next few years within Medicare to a mandatory, what you tend to see in this situation is a much bigger focus on the post-acute care, particularly patients that are discharged to rehab because the dollars there and the opportunities for cost savings are much, much greater than any of the other areas. So what we've seen is they tend to focus there is significant disparity around the U.S. in terms of what patients are sent home versus those that go directly to rehab. And we'd expect that trend to continue. Doesn't mean pricing pressure isn't going to go away. We just don't believe that's going to be a trigger to change dramatically the pricing backdrop within the implants.", "Operator", "The next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi, good afternoon. I had two follow-up questions on Spine. Kevin, the U.S. Spine number came in better than we thought, and I'm just curious, is that a function of a stronger Spine market in the U.S.? In other words, better unit growth, less payer pushback and pricing pressure? Or is this market share gains given your new product rollouts? And then as a follow-up, in the past, Kevin, you've talked about wanting to grow Spine organically and inorganically. Given the strength of the current pipeline, should we start to assume that internal development is the way you're going to go versus M&A? Thanks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, first thing I'd say is the Spine market's been a pretty stable market over the last couple of years, and so I don't believe the market is suddenly improving magically. I would say the last two quarters we've been very pleased with our performance in the U.S., and we believe that's because of the new products that we're launching and that we're growing faster than the market. Now, of course, not everybody has reported yet, so we won't have a full picture on our share gains in this quarter until everyone else reports.", "Related to the organic versus inorganic, we're very pleased with growing our business organically. That's always the best way to drive value in our businesses. And as it relates to inorganic, all of our divisions are constantly looking for acquisitions. I certainly don't feel compelled to do a deal, because you can see we're posting nice growth with our organic performance. But we're always on the lookout for acquisitions. But that's not unique to Spine; that applies to all of our divisions.", "Glenn J. Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And next question is from Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask a bit about MAKO, and you laid out your plans over the next couple of years in terms of collecting data before you go broader with the technology. And I'm curious as you start to think about the data and where you think the opportunities are to present the compelling case to hospitals to adopt it, is it primarily going to be focused on efficiencies and hospitals running their practices more efficiently? Or will it be focused on patient satisfaction, or perhaps both? Anything you could give us on that would be helpful.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, sure, Raj. I think as you think about what we said in terms of the early launch, was we're really looking at observational outcomes with both existing robotic and non-robotic users, but really focusing on the key opinion leaders who really have a presence at the podium. And we're going to be evaluating everything from implant positioning, adverse events, ligament releases, patient satisfaction, that's going to be a lot of the initial focus. Absolutely over time we'll be developing, I'm sure, more robust clinical evaluations or trials, but right now that's going to be the focus initially.", "Raj S. Denhoy - Jefferies LLC", "So less on the cost side it sounds like initially in terms of hospitals being able to do orthopaedics more efficiently or cheaper.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "I think that's something that will come over time as surgeons move up the learning curve and gain greater experience. But given a very limited launch early on as we look to optimize the training protocol, that won't be the focus.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. I want to just start with a strategic question, and Kevin, this does relate to your comments around emerging markets. I think if we look back a few years, those regions represented a significant priority for you as some of the U.S. businesses were a little bit more sluggish. But maybe in the context of what you're seeing today, can you maybe just help us understand where you're prioritizing your investments? And as you think about those investments, where should we expect to see the greatest return within your business?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, sure. Right now, emerging markets represent about 8% of Stryker's sales, and that's clearly below MedTech. It's not a bad time to be less exposed to emerging markets, but that doesn't mean we aren't committed for the long term. Our India business is doing well. China will be an important market for the future, so certainly we're not going to invest at the same rate that we've invested the last couple years while we weather the current storm. But we are in it for the long term and we do plan to grow in emerging markets. It's just \u2013 we had planned previously to be a little bit more aggressive in areas like Russia and Turkey. That's currently not a good a use of our investment right now, so we'll sort of hit the pause button in those countries. And then as the market conditions improve, we'll dial up the investments.", "Very pleased with the investments we made in Europe; those are driving terrific returns. As an overall company, we do want to grow our business outside the United States. Our strong U.S. business continues to perform very well, and we do plan to grow outside the U.S., and that's why the Operating Model changes are extending even beyond Europe to include the other countries of the world, because I think that direct connection to our product divisions will drive growth everywhere else outside the United States. And Europe is very instructive. What we've seen in Europe we know we can replicate in other countries.", "David Harrison Roman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, then maybe just a follow-up from maybe a combination of a macro and a micro question. If you look at some of the businesses in which you operate, whether it's some of the MedSurg business or procedure volume, exposed areas, we have seen a nice pickup in growth. And while, clearly, you have some new product momentum in those areas, how much do you think of the growth we're seeing is a catch-up from prior periods of some headwinds versus what might be entering kind of a new normal steady state growth rate for some of those franchises?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I'm not sure what catch-up you're referring to, because if you look at the last year's third quarter, we had knee growth of 6.8%, hip growth of 18.1%, trauma 15.3%. So we're posting strong growth this quarter on the backs of pretty strong growth in the prior year. So for 10 quarters \u2013 consecutive quarters of over 5% organic growth \u2013 it's not like we're catching the tail of periods of slow growth. We're posting consistent, steady, strong growth. Now, from quarter to quarter there's some variation between businesses, but overall, this is a very steady growth story that you're seeing at Stryker.", "I'm not sure I understand the question, or if it's a specific business you're referring to, because on an overall basis, we're posting growth on top of prior growth quarters that were pretty strong.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Matt Keeler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thanks for taking the questions. First, can you help us think about the MAKO total knee opportunity? You talked about MAKO success in Uni and the share gains \u2013 I think 17% over four years. Once the total knee is launched starting in 2017, do you see the potential for a similar magnitude of share ramp going forward from there?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, we haven't quantified the targeted gains. We have been very clear that we do expect, once it's in full commercial release, to begin to get on a trajectory to gain meaningful market share, and we would expect to be on that trajectory in 2017. I wouldn't be assuming quite that level of share gains, but we also want to get some experience under our belt. This is brand new to the industry, and \u2013 but we're really excited about the impact it will have in terms of driving share gain in 2017. I think as we get closer to that timeframe and we think about setting our targets for 2017, we'll be able to have a better sense of what that could practically mean.", "Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And just I'll stick with MAKO. As you invest in training next year as you get the launch underway, do you expect that to be a drag at all on margins ahead of when you're fully launched in 2017?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "No, I think you should just assume that'll be contemplated within our normal spend.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Two for me. One on MedSurg. One on Neurovascular. Starting with MedSurg, the growth has slowed a little bit this year. I know you talked about a new camera, I think in Q4, in endoscopy. Could you just talk about just when \u2013 how long it will take to kind of re-accelerate the growth across MedSurg, and some of the other kind of new product cycles we should be thinking about? And I had one follow-up. Thanks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, so the first thing I'd say about our MedSurg businesses is they had an absolutely huge quarter in the third quarter of last year. If you look back at the numbers that we posted, close to 20% growth in a number of our \u2013 of those businesses \u2013 so very tough comps. And we're very pleased with our Medical division and expect them to continue to perform very well.", "Endoscopy, certainly we've had a few challenges related to the Berchtold integration. That's starting to pick up steam, and I'm feeling very optimistic about that. That camera launch, it's sort of the end of the 1488 camera cycle; we're moving to the 1588 platform. That will be launched toward the end of this year, and certainly there was a little bit of a delay in orders as people are anticipating that launch.", "The one product area that is later in its cycle is our system 7 power tools, within instruments, but if you look at the instruments numbers, they continue to post pretty strong results throughout the rest of their portfolio. But that's one area as you look into 2016 where you can anticipate maybe a little bit of a moderating of growth as it gets towards the latter part of their cycle. But they have another range of products that they can sell, and they're performing very well.", "So I would tell you I'm very pleased with our MedSurg performance. I know that the absolute growth in this quarter looks a little smaller, but again, on the back of an outstanding third quarter of last year. It's not like our business is slowing down or that we're losing momentum or losing share. I feel like we have very, very solid businesses that will continue to perform well.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks, Kevin. And then on neurotech and Neurovascular, the growth's obviously been very strong recently. Can you help tease out how much of that growth is from the Trevo benefiting from the new stroke data versus your coils and flow diverters also growing? And any update just on how the stroke market is evolving since all the new positive data earlier this year? Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, well, I would start by saying when you look at our portfolio it does address both hemorrhagic and ischemic, but the majority of the revenue is still driven on the hemorrhagic side, which is going to be the coils and related accessories where we're seeing growth. Ischemic growth is certainly outpacing that, but it's a much smaller market at this point in time. And it's certainly benefiting from data, whether it's the MR CLEAN study that showed using stent retrievers, including the majority of the retrievers used in that device was our own, absolutely have a benefit on patients, and this was further enhanced with the AHA guidelines that came out earlier in their year. So that data is really underscoring the benefits of these devices that are the only devices that have clinical data supporting their use in ischemic patients. So growth there is much faster, but obviously off a much smaller base.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Matt O'Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, everyone. This is GP (51:57) in for Matt. Thanks for taking my question. I had one on just the competitive landscape that you're seeing in maybe Hips and Knees, especially with kind of new entrants into the market and maybe other large integrations with Zimmer Biomet there, if you're seeing any displacements or distractions?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "There really haven't been any new entrants into the Hip and Knee market. The competitive backdrop has been very stable. I think as we think about the merger between Biomet and Zimmer, they're obviously a considerable player in the market. We haven't seen them report Q3 results, so like you, we're at a disadvantage. We feel very pleased with the momentum we're seeing in the business. We have said it's usually a few quarters in before you really get a sense if any dissynergies are tracking above or below what they anticipate, but we're really focused on our business. We have got a great portfolio of products. Obviously, the MAKO and the new indication we see as a huge benefit. We'll see what happens to them, but really the focus right now is gaining traction with our own customers and using MAKO to get into some competitive accounts.", "Unknown Speaker", "Great. And if I could just ask one on MAKO, if you think about the pipeline of new indications that you're kind of looking at in your R&D, what's next? Should we think about maybe a shoulder or maybe moving into spine? But just trying to see what you have there.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "I would say when you think about it, right now, essentially all of our focus is on the recon market. I can't underscore enough the amount of time and energy that's being put into the total knee launch to make sure it is executed as close to flawlessly as possible. We do think that is the biggest indication and can have considerable impact on the market. I think there will be downstream applications in other areas of joints, whether it's in the shoulder or in the spine, but that is multi years away from where our focus is right now.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ben Andrew from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. Maybe just talk a little bit about the Foot and Ankle business. It was up 20% or so in the quarter, and how much of that is sustainable over time, given what the current competitive dynamic is versus maybe the underlying market growth?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so new markets are often difficult to predict, right? So when we created our Foot and Ankle business unit a few years ago, I really didn't expect that the market would be this big and that the growth would be this high. So it's been a fantastic business unit for us, performing extremely well mostly with organic growth. We had, obviously, the SBI acquisition as well. The market still seems to be very hot. There's still a lot of surgeons that are increasing their volumes, and more and more surgeons getting trained. So we do believe that this will be a high growth market for the foreseeable future. Now, whether it stays up at the 20% or starts to moderate, I'm not sure, but we're not really concerned about competitive dynamics. We have a great product portfolio, very strong sales force execution, and when you're riding market growth and you've got the products and the sales force, it's a good place to be.", "Ben C. Andrew - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones. Maybe the first one on MAKO, Katherine I guess. Can you characterize the types of accounts that are purchasing the system right now or is it possible to do so? Any certain types of characteristics, academic centers, community hospitals? And then also, what percentage of your installed base or new systems over the last few quarters are going to multisystem accounts?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "That, the latter, very small. And it really covers the entire range; we're seeing all sorts of customers out there. I wouldn't be able to characterize it as one specific type of hospital. We have some hospitals with one robot, some with multi. We have some that were existing customers, some that are competitive customers, some that are buying the robots, some that are leasing the robots. So it really is the full range. There's not one specific characteristic that I would point to.", "Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then Kevin, just going back to M&A, obviously there's been quite a bit of turmoil in health care equity markets. Valuations look like they've been pulling back. To the extent that \u2013 were valuations in any way potentially something that was slowing down the process for you guys as you've looked around? And does this kind of recent pullback make things more attractive from your seat?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, M&A, the timing of M&A is always difficult to predict. And valuations is one factor; it's not always the only factor. We also have issues sometimes around quality, of remediation that's required. Sometimes it's cultural fit, so there's always a range of issues that we go through when we're looking at a target, and as we get under the covers and do due diligence, then we sort of figure out whether we really want to move forward or not. Valuation clearly is always one of the factors, but I wouldn't say suddenly, just because we have a temporary market pullback that the companies are ready to sell to us at a much lower price. So, I think it will take a little time for that to settle in, but clearly, valuations is one of the factors that we look at and one of the reasons that we won't move forward. But it's not the only reason.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot. One question on MAKO first. Can you just talk about the robotic competitive landscape that you're seeing from direct competition, Omni or Blue Belt, and then how you see that evolving now with the total knee application approved?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so I tell you that we're not focused at all on the competition. We really don't see Blue Belt as a fully robotic solution. It's really, in our view, it's an enhanced navigation system. It doesn't have the type of features that our system has. So we really believe we're alone in the purely true robotic space, and we have a long runway ahead of us. And we're really not concerned with the competition.", "Joshua T. Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great, and just a follow-up for Bill. You had some discussion about opportunities for operating margin expansion. Any chance you can give us some more details on where you see those opportunities in the different business units? Are there more opportunity in recon versus Neurotechnology versus MedSurg? Any further detail would be great. Thanks a lot.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Sure, so I mean, one, we don't break that down externally at all. But I mean, you should expect that any of our businesses that are seeing mid-digit plus kind of organic level growth, we would expect to get reasonably good operating margin improvements on that over time. And based on the market growth dynamics in different geographies and/or in aggregate for a business, if the growth rates are down in the lower single digit range, you probably shouldn't expect really any operating margin improvements. As that goes up though, we should definitely get operating margin leverage in almost any of our businesses. And I think that, in general, that's what we're driving to achieve over a two to three year period of time, on average.", "Operator", "And our next question is from William Plovanic from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead.", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great, thanks. So two brief questions, one on MAKO. How long were the cost or time associated with updating those to accommodate the total knee into your current number of systems out in the field? And then second question for Bill, just on the gross margin, that was a huge increase. And I know you gave us the reasons, FX mix and efficiencies offset by price, but I was wondering if you could quantify those. And then how much of that \u2013 are we at a new level \u2013 we're going to be 50 bps, 100 bps higher going forward? Or will we just drop back down to where we were in the first half of this year and this is kind of a one quarter gain just because we had the big U.S. quarter? Thank you.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, Bill, just \u2013 I want to make sure I'm understanding the question \u2013 you're saying how long it takes to physically upgrade an existing account to the new indication, to the new robot? The software and the related hardware components?", "William J. Plovanic - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Well, It's really just how long will it take until you're through to update all the units in the field? Is that, like, through 2016, you'll be done by the end of the year?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "I would say at the end of 2016, we feel like we'll be in a very good position to go into a full commercial launch and we won't be limited by the need to upgrade existing customers. You're always bringing on new customers, but that's part of the reason to have a very measured, controlled rollout, is to make sure that we're in a position really to put the pedal down when we go into full commercial launch.", "William R. Jellison - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "As far as the gross margin rate question is concerned, so yes, it was a very good quarter, as I mentioned, really in the early part of this year, both in the first and second quarter. We talked that our gross margin rates were going to improve as we moved into the third and even in the fourth quarter of this year. Our expectation maybe from a breakdown of some of the categories, so two of the biggest impacts in this quarter are FX and mix, and maybe a little bit on the pricing, since pricing was only at 1.3% for us. But FX and mix were probably, if you look at the total improvement, they're probably each in the 50 basis point plus range as far as the impacts that they have.", "Keep in mind that a lot of our products are manufactured in Europe, so as the European or the Euro currencies have been declining this year and the U.S. has stayed strong, we've actually continued to get improved gross margin rates from FX, despite the fact that FX on the bottom line at the EPS level has actually been negative for us.", "And then, same thing on the mix side. I think that you should expect both of those to continue as we move into the fourth quarter. And then you should look more from an anniversary perspective that the improvements that we'd expect next year would be relatively modest at the gross margin level, but we'll get into that as we announce our overall expectations for the year. Generally, if price is at the upper end or in the 1.7%, 1.8% to 2% range, we'd expect our gross margins to be relatively flat in that kind of an environment.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2015 results will be held on January 26, 2016. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have an opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K, filed today with the SEC.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter 2015 Earnings Call.", "Joining me today are Bill Jellison, our CFO, Katherine Owen, Vice President of Strategy and Investor Relations and Glenn Boehnlein will be taking over for Bill on April 1. Following my opening comments, Katherine will provide an update on MAKO, while Bill will offer more details on our quarterly results before turning to questions and answers.", "With a 6.4% increase in organic sales in Q4, we continue to deliver on our goal of driving topline growth at the high end of MedTech. This marks the eleventh consecutive quarter where Stryker delivered 5% or better organic sales growth demonstrating strong consistency over time.", "Our diversified sales footprint has once again proven to be a key component of our growth strategy as all of our segments, Orthopedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine posted good results in the quarter.", "These performances underscore the strength of our sales and marketing execution and our innovation engine, which is characterized by healthy R&D investment and a focus and disciplined M&A effort.", "Approximately 70% of our sales are derived from our U.S. businesses, which once again led growth, hosting an impressive gain of approximately 8%. I\u2019m also pleased with the growing momentum out of Europe including strong Q4 results benefiting from the shift for the Transatlantic Operating Model at the beginning of 2015.", "We are building on the success as we start 2016 with Canada rolling into the model and the other regions now reporting to our Group Presidents since Tim Scannell and David Floyd.", "Our international growth of roughly 4% in constant currency was once again impacted by soft performances in China and Brazil. However, as you've seen, we've demonstrated the ability to offset isolated geographic softness to strengthen our larger markets.", "Turning to earnings, our adjusted EPS for Q4 of $1.56 is at the high end of our revised range of $1.53 to $1.56, primarily driven by the strong topline. The balance of the P&L came in as expected which Bill will cover in his section.", "Looking ahead to 2016, we expect our sales momentum to continue and are targeting organic sales growth for the year of 5% to 6%. This takes into account expected softness in emerging markets for a good portion of the year.", "In addition the two year suspension of the Med Device Tax provides us with the opportunity to bolster investments and will help drive sales growth and innovation as we plan to invest the majority of this temporary benefit.", "We\u2019re also continuing on our path toward driving greater cost efficiencies which is multiyear opportunity. Over the past year, we've been focused on identifying and prioritizing the key target areas for cost reduction within our organization.", "As we shift into 2016, we are moving toward project implementation under the leadership of Group President Lonny Carpenter. We've identified significant areas of savings centered around optimizing our plant network, rationalizing our product lines, professionalizing our indirect procurement in a similar manner as we've done with direct materials moving to a common ERP system and driving more shared services.", "Given our history of decentralization, there is considerable opportunity ahead of us in this program. We believe a methodical and deliberate approach to these efforts will allow us to preserve Stryker\u2019s competitive differentiation in the areas of sales, marketing, R&D and business development, while hoping to ensure we're consistently delivering P&L leverage.", "This is reflected in our 2016 adjusted EPS range of $5.50 to $5.70 a share. This is an increase of approximately 7.5% to 11.5% versus 2015 and it includes a negative foreign exchange impact of $0.12 to $0.13 a share.", "Finally, I would like to take a moment to extend my thanks and appreciation to Bill Jellison, who has announced his plans to retire following an impressive 36-year career, the last three of which have been in Stryker. Bill was able to quickly move toward implementing a layered hedging program, which has proven to be successful at mitigating our transactional FX exposure.", "In addition, he helped execute on a number of acquisitions, facilitated the establishment of our European regional headquarters that's enabled significant savings and has also helped to shape our comprehensive cost reduction program.", "These accomplishments have meaningfully contributed to our success and we've achieved while enabling our internal talent pool to develop including Glenn Boehnlein who has been promoted to CFO effective April 1.", "Glenn has been with Stryker in various financial leadership roles since 2003, most recently serving as Group CFO for the MedSurg and Neurotechnology Group. This group represents roughly half of the company and has been a consistent force behind our strong results. I\u2019m confident in Glenn\u2019s ability and coordination with the broader financial organization to help build on our strong momentum.", "Before turning the call over to Katherine, I would ask Glenn to make a few comments. Glenn?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Thanks Kevin. I appreciate the comments and the support, but I also want to thank Bill for his leadership of the finance organization over the past few years and for his commitment to helping ensure a smooth transition as I take on new responsibilities.", "It\u2019s a very exciting time at Stryker and I\u2019m thrilled to be part of such a great organization with so many talented and dedicated people. I\u2019m also looking forward to meeting many of our shareholders, analysts at the various events going forward.", "And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Glenn. The focus of my comments today will be to provide an update on MAKO. 2015 was a year of building momentum for MAKO\u2019s robotic assisted surgery as we continue to leverage our considerable sale and marketing infrastructure to help drive sales.", "We're particularly pleased with the increased demand for the hip indication, which has been augmented by combining the robotic technology with our proven portfolio of Stryker Hip Systems.", "The combination enables surgeons to use a best-in-class hip implant with a long term proven clinical history on a robotic assisted platform, which helps drive consistency, enhance surgeon and patient experience and we believe over time, clinically demonstrated benefits.", "In total we sold 31 robots globally in the quarter, 24 of which were in the U.S., which represents a solid ramp from the start of the year and a significant jump year-over-year from 20 in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "For 2016, we're focused on continuing to drive adoption with our current indications, which we believe offers considerable opportunity to drive ongoing robot license.", "We're also excited about the potential for the total knee indication with our flagship triathlon system. This year our efforts will be centered around gaining user experience with key opinion leaders to help ensure an optimal rollout as we look to full commercial release in 2017.", "We believe the commercial launch, which will be aided by podium presentations from the early users group will be in place as we head into next year.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill.", "Bill Jellison", "Thanks, Katherine.", "I would like to start off by saying I've enjoyed working with Kevin and everyone at Stryker, especially the entire finance organization, who have made significant contributions over the last few years helping the company deliver on its financial results, coming to Stryker with a strong cultural fit and personal fit from the first week that I joined the company.", "We ended 2015 at the high end of both our initial sales and earnings guidance that was set at the beginning of the year. As we look at 2016 and set our initial guidance, I am confident that our sales momentum, strong product portfolio and pipeline and the cost containment initiatives we're driving for business well for the future.", "I look forward to ensuring a smooth transition with Glenn and entering another stage of my life. I'll continue to engage actively in many of my passions, travel with my family and friends and explore additional Board opportunities. I want to thank all of you for your support.", "So turning to our financial performance, sales grew 3.7% in the quarter, including a negative 3.2% impact from foreign currency translation. Constant currency sales growth was 7%, which includes organic growth of 6.4%.", "GAAP EPS for the quarter was $1.38 per share versus $0.68 last year in the fourth quarter, while adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 a share for the quarter versus $1.44 per share in the fourth quarter last year.", "This quarter's EPS includes negative impacts of roughly $0.04 per share from foreign exchange, which was in line with our guidance. Most currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar continue to be weaker than last year in the same period.", "The weaker Euro and Swiss Franc along with our layered hedging program helped to mitigate some of the impacts in the quarter, as many of our products are manufactured in Europe, which helped improve our gross margin rates in the period.", "However, significant weakening in foreign currency rates in emerging markets and the continued weakness of the Japanese Yen, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar, where we have minimal manufacturing, negatively impacted our gross margins and operating results in those regions.", "The most significant non-GAAP adjustments in the quarter where amortization, restructuring changes and a net reduction in the charge associated with the voluntary recalls of the Rejuvenate ABG II Modular Hip Stem as we resolved some insurance matters in the quarter, which more than offset the additional in the period.", "As I've mentioned previously, the charges we've recorded related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II recall represents a minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve this manner and the charges may increase or decrease over time as additional facts become available and our assumptions more refined.", "In the fourth quarter, our organic growth rate was 6.4% including 8.1% growth in unit volumes and mix with price negatively impacting sales by 1.7%. Acquisitions added 0.6%, while FX had a negative 3.2% impact due to significant weakness in both the Japanese Yen and the Australian Dollar, compared to the same period last year.", "Full year 2015 constant currency sales growth were 7% and organic growth was 6.1%.", "Looking at our segments, Orthopaedics represented 42% of our sales in the quarter and sales of Orthopaedic products grew 3.3% as reported, and 7.1% in constant currency. U.S. Orthopaedic sales grew 9.7% in the quarter.", "Trauma and Extremities had another excellent quarter in the U.S. with sales increasing 13.6%, led by strong growth in Foot and Ankle, which again grew approximately 20% for both the fourth quarter and full year.", "U.S. Hips and Knees continued their strong performance of 6.4% and 9.1% organic growth respectively in the quarter. Knee sales were bolstered by increased adoption of recent titanium 3d printed products.", "Our international Orthopaedic business grew 2.4% in constant currency as sales growth continue to be negatively impacted by weakness in China and Brazil.", "However our international Knee business grew 5.5% in constant currency in the quarter. Finally we sold 31 MAKO units in the quarter and 72 units in the full year.", "Next, our MedSurg segment represented approximately 40% of our total sales and sales of MedSurg products grew 3% as reported and 5.6% in constant currency. These results were led by growth in our Instruments and Medical business, both of which had strong mid single digit percentage growth in constant currency.", "Endoscopy also posted mid single digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period on the back of our new camera offering, which was launched in December.", "All three of these large MedSurg businesses continue to manage pricing decisions effectively with modest price declines of less than 0.5% for the year.", "Our final segment, Neurotechnology and Spine, represented 18% of sales and delivered another good quarter. Sales of Neurotechnology and Spine products grew 6.5% as reported and 9.9% in constant currency.", "Growth in this segment was led by our Neurotechnology business which had double-digit growth in the high teens in constant currency in the fourth quarter and grew high teens in the U.S. Spine sales had mid single digit percentage growth in constant currency in the period and had high single digit growth in the U.S.", "This marks our third consecutive quarter of strong growth in U.S. spine. Spine also had a new 3D printed interbody device launching in 2016, which we believe will be a very exciting product for the market, helping us to continue this positive trend.", "In looking at our operational performance, gross margin as a percent of sales on an adjusted basis in the fourth quarter was 67.2%, compared to 65.8% in the fourth quarter last year.", "When compared to the same period last year, the rate was positively impacted by solid operational improvements, product mix and FX rates, despite the negative FX impact on earnings per share.", "Price had a negative impact as pricing was lower by 1.7% in the period. Our gross margin as a percentage of sales was 66.5% or 50 basis points higher than last year.", "Research and development expenses increased by 20 basis points to 6% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 5.8% in the same period last year. On an adjusted basis, selling, general and administrative expenses represented 33.7% of sales in the fourth quarter compared to 32.4% in the same period last year.", "As expected these expenses were higher for the year as we increased spending to support the cost structure of our European regional headquarters in Amsterdam and our Transatlantic operating model.", "We're confident in our ability to leverage these expenses in 2016 as we continue to drive in a number of key cost initiatives even as we reinvest some of the savings from the suspension of the medical device tax.", "Operating margin as a percentage of sales on an adjusted basis were 27.4% in the fourth quarter, compared to 27.6% in the same period last year. The full year adjusted operating margin rate was 24.9% nearly flat compared to last year.", "During the year we invested in our European regional headquarters and the establishment of our Transatlantic operating model, which reduced the stronger operating margins for the year.", "Other expense in the fourth quarter was $36 million. This increase in expense resulted primarily from higher net interest expense due to increased borrowings and foreign currency exchange transactional losses in the fourth quarter. This is generally consistent with the run rate for this category.", "Our reported tax rate for the fourth quarter was 14.7% while the adjusted effective tax rate was 16.6% for the fourth quarter compared to 22.6% in the same period last year. The fourth quarter effective tax rate benefited from the renewal of the tax extenders, which was contemplated in our guidance.", "The full year adjusted effective tax rate was 17.3% compared to 22.3% last year as we realize the benefits from our global tax structure in European regional headquarters in Amsterdam.", "Looking at the balance sheet we ended the quarter with $4.1 billion of cash and marketable securities, approximately 50% of it now held in the U.S. We also had $4 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter.", "From an asset management standpoint, accounts receivable days ended the quarter at 55 relatively unchanged from last year. Days and inventory finished the quarter at 165, which was an increase of five days compared to last year.", "Turing to cash flow, our cash flow from operations for 2015 were $900 million compared to $1.8 billion last year, but as previously mentioned, we made significant payments earlier this year associated with our rejuvenate and ABG II Recall settlement of $1.2 billion most of which occurred in the third quarter. Approximately 50% of the funding of the rejuvenate liability is being source from OUS cash.", "We also repatriated a total of $1.8 billion in 2015 including approximately $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Capital expenditures were $270 million in 2015 compared to $233 million last year.", "Finally regarding share repurchases in 2015 we repurchased approximately $700 million of our current stock or approximately 7.5 million shares at an average price of approximately of $94.67. We have authorization for another 1.9 billion available for repurchase under our current authorization.", "Based on our strong performance in 2015 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions we are projecting constant currency and organic sales growth in a range of 5% to 6% for 2016 and expect to be at the low end of that range in the first quarter as we are still anticipating impacts of market conditions in the emerging markets especially China and Brazil.", "The foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels. We anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2% consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2015.", "Due to the suspension of the MedTech tax we will also provide some additional visibility to our projected margin rates for 2016. Both gross margin and operating income margins are projected to be at least 50 basis points higher in 2016 in total.", "The benefit from the suspension of the MedTech tax will directly benefit our gross profit rate. However R&D will run slightly higher in 2016 and our SG&A rate will only show modest improvement for the full year as we expect to reinvest the majority of the benefit we receive into this area offsetting much of our cost reductions in '16.", "As such our gross margin rate improvements will be the driver of our operating margin rate in 2016. We expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2016 will continue to be approximately 17% to 17.5%.", "Capital expenditures are expected to be $400 million to $450 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure to support future growth. Based on the current foreign exchange rates, we expect 2016 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12 to $0.13 for the full year and approximately $0.03 for the first quarter.", "This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign exchange on earnings has been offset somewhat by both natural and real hedges, which we continue to layer into our operations.", "Finally our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 is $5.50 to $5.70 for the full year and $1.17 to $1.22 for the first quarter.", "Thanks for your support and we\u2019ll be glad to answer any questions that you may have at this time.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, callers will be limited to one question and one follow-up question. Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Bob Hopkins", "Thanks. Can you hear me okay ", "Katherine Owen", "Hi Bob.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great, hey good afternoon. So first Bill, sorry to see you move on, but good luck with the next chapter. So it will be remised if I didn\u2019t asked a follow-up question on this announcement and may be the way to phrase the question Bill is and for Kevin and Katherine, you guys have been talking about M&A for some time.", "And I\u2019m just curious if this CFO transition suggests any change in strategy or maybe suggested mirror larger deals kind of less likely until after this transition is complete. Just getting curious how this could affect strategy and/or the outlook for M&A and thanks and again congrats Bill for the decision.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, thanks Bob. Look I would tell you right now the company is in very good shape. You can see the way we\u2019re performing. This is an internal transition with somebody who is inside our company. So this not like we're signaling any kind of shift in strategy.", "I would tell you we\u2019ve been very consistent on capital allocation since I've been in the job and even before that our approach is to favor M&A first, then dividends and then share buyback. So there is absolutely zero change to our operating mode and I\u2019m expecting a very smooth transition.", "You can see that we have a whole quarter of overlap and Bill is still going to be around in this community and available to help us as needed. So I would tell you that you should expect more of the same from Stryker and this should be a very seamless change.", "Bob Hopkins", "All right, thank you for that. And then as a quick follow-up also Kevin from a big picture perspective, I was wondering if you could kind of give us your sense for the outlook for hospital capital spending in 2016, what are you seeing from hospitals, you\u2019re expecting any changes?", "Just wanted to get a sense for your view on the 2016 outlook for CapEx especially since you\u2019re launching some new products into the market right now?", "Kevin Lobo", "Thanks Bob. Look we see the market as very stable for capital equipment. You can see in the fourth quarter we had very strong performances on MAKO, selling capital, that\u2019s large capital. We also have a lot of small capital. Our instruments division did very well in the fourth quarter.", "So we look at the market as being very stable. We're just embarking upon our launch of our new camera 1588 with an endoscopy. We had a nice start in the month of December and the orders look quite healthy going into the year. So, we're not seeing really any change, a very stable capital market.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mike Weinstein from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thanks for taking the question. Good evening everybody and Bill my sentiments as well. Thanks for all your help and enjoy your time away from Stryker.", "Let me ask a couple questions guys. So one question is the 5% to 6% constant currency guidance for 2016 obviously, you've by and large have been running above that. Can you just tell us what you have baked in there for the emerging market performance because obviously you're still assuming a challenge in emerging market environment for the year? So I just want to get some sensitivity around it.", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah, Mike in terms of emerging markets which is in that 7% to 8% of our total sales in China and Brazil are the biggest components, although we\u2019ve been seeing nice growth in markets outside of that.", "We've assumed those markets remain challenging for the better part of the year. China as well as Brazil were difficult to predict given the macro issue surrounding them.", "We do benefit from easier comparisons as we get to the back half of the year, but we assume your real market there continues to be a bit of a challenge.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah Mike, I would say the emerging markets for us, we had similar performance in the fourth quarter as we did in the third quarter. So we're slightly negative in terms of growth in our emerging markets, China of course being the biggest drag and for Stryker, we have a capital equipment business especially the Endoscopy division that's quite big in China and so that has a bit more of an impact to the disposables or implants on Stryker.", "So we're expecting that to continue to be difficult and that will be a drag and it's certainly in the year. So we're setting our guidance from five to six. As you saw last year, we moved our guidance up during the year.", "If these conditions don't or are not as severe, you can expect even do the same, it doesn\u2019t change our outlook on our business. We feel very good about our business, but it's early in the year and we know that those markets are going to be challenged and we're just baking in some caution around those markets.", "Mike Weinstein", "Understood. So let me two quick follow-ups relative to the guidance. So one, you started to talk about the cost transformation initiative in greater detail in San Francisco and in the 2016 guidance, you're basically assuming no SG&A leverage and that's part of what you're what about reinvesting back in the business with the benefit of the MedTech packs, helping the gross margin line.", "So can you just talk a little about where you're going to incrementally invest if that will show up in SG&A or will it all show up in R&D.", "And then second, the acceleration of the share buyback and acceleration maybe is not the right term, but you bought that more stock than you had been buying back in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's in your 2016 guidance curve for capital deployment?", "Bill Jellison", "Yeah, so it's couple different questions there. The first one associated with kind of the margin rates and also the SG&A area. We do and expect some modest level of improvement still in the broader operating expense category, but the reinvestment is primarily taking place in both areas, probably about maybe 20 basis points or so of an impact on the R&D related side and the remainder kind of in the SG&A area.", "I would say that with the cost initiatives that we've got in place that you would have seen and obviously better leverage there, but with the reinvestment that will slow that down at least this year, but we should still be showing obviously some very solid gross margin rate improvement and we should be getting good drop-through still into the operating income line for that.", "As it relates to the buybacks, yes we did jump that up to about $700 million in this year. As you can see, our cash has continued to stay very strong. We were able to bring back some additional cash.", "We have about $2 billion here in the U.S. at this point and as far as our guidance is concerned, you should expect that we commented before that we've got the authorization out there.", "We expected to complete that over kind of a two to three year period of time barring any sizeable acquisitions and hopefully as Kevin mentioned, acquisitions are absolutely still our first and foremost kind of attention within that space and we expect to be very active as we move forward, but those are all based on timing situations right. So -- but that is still our number one focus.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rick Wise from Stifel. Please go ahead.", "Rick Wise", "Hi Kevin. Hi everybody. Maybe Kevin to start my first would be on the operating margin outlook. Obviously you're exiting 15% to 27.4% maybe just comment if you would on your aspirational goals here? Is it 30%? Is it 35% over the next two to four and three to five years, but just talk about the magnitude and the durability of this seemingly long-tailed opportunity?", "Kevin Lobo", "So Rick, look we only give guidance out for one year right. So we provided you guidance this year, which shows some pretty meaningful leverage on the EPS line. Coming off the year, we just delivered leverage and we didn't have the 12% to 13% share of negative FX.", "We would be giving EPS in the 10% to 14% range. So that's pretty meaningful leverage on sales of 5% to 6%. So you should expect us to continue to drive meaningful leverage. That's the goal of the constant program.", "We've said before there are significant opportunities in the hundreds of millions of dollars and as we drive those savings, we'll obviously if there is great opportunities to invest, we'll invest some of those dollars and some of those dollars will fall to the bottom line.", "But I don't have a magical number and I think it also depends on as the year's progress, what types of deals that we do and how that affects our margin profile. So I think each year, you'll expect us to give the kind of guidance we're giving you this year, nice robust organic growth and a nice amount of leverage to the bottom line and I think I'll just leave it at that.", "Rick Wise", "Okay. And Katherine maybe for you on MAKO. Can you give us a little more color on your comment you talked about increased demand for the hip indication. It seemed to me you've placed a few more systems than we expected. Can you talk about the placements and the utilization and maybe where you are in the rollout for new indications in software?", "Katherine Owen", "So I think it really is reflective of being complete year two of the acquisition. So working through the integration and really helping the combined sales forces to optimize their education and around the features and benefits of our hip system on the robot-assisted platform and getting out there and really detailing those benefits.", "It's a nice mix of both existing striker customers, but also new accounts that we're able to get into with the robots. We're really pleased with the placement as well as having a number of them outside the U.S.", "I would really just emphasize 2016 is about really working to make sure we are optimally set up for full commercial launch in '17 for the total needs, so we are not expecting any real impact from that this year. We have a lot of work to do to optimize the training protocol.", "We're going to work with key opinion leaders, both on the robotic side as well as KOLs with our triathlon system to make sure we are meshing those observational studies to really fine-tune the training protocol. We then have to train our own sales force do the upgrades of the system.", "So there is a lot work to be done to make sure when we go into full commercial launch, we're set to really optimize that and have a presence at the podium. So we'll continue to drive placements with the existing indications for 2016 while doing the necessary ground work to really ensure when the great position in 2017 to take full advantage of the total knee indication.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "David Roman", "Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I wanted to just start with some of the investment spending that you're committing to through the P&L. Over the past several years, you've been very consistent with investing your business both SG&A and R&D, which has obviously produced this very nice topline growth rate.", "But as you look forward as you continue to invest in the business, do you see opportunities to enhance the topline growth rate beyond what you're performing today and where are the most attractive areas of investment for you?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, I can tell you that I get a chance to travel around all of our divisions over the course of the year and yet to meet and R&D that has enough money to spend on new product.", "So I would say that all the divisions have opportunities. There is clearly some areas that we would focus on a little bit more than others. So you've seen our spine business really start to turn based on focused investments in R&D.", "We've had three great quarters in a row in the U.S. We still have to take a lot of those products outside the U.S. But I would say that will be in area where organic development and spending is really paying off for us. So you could expect more in that area.", "Sports medicine for us is a business that's growing very fast. It's relatively small within Stryker. That's also an area of interest. Neurotechnology as well as extremities, I would say I picked those four right off on top of my head, but I would tell you we have a long list and if my other division president's are listening on the call, I know that they're preparing ideas for me as well.", "And we'll obviously look at all the ideas and determine which ones we think can really provide value for us. We're not going to just spend for the sake of spending.", "In the company as big as Stryker is with the decentralized focus, we're seeing that innovation delivers. And I cited one example of 3D printing where I think we're seeing it to have an impact on two different divisions of striker our knee business as well as spine and we have a huge line up of other divisions with ideas and prototypes to get into 3D printer titanium product.", "So I would say that those are the top of mind areas of focus, but all the divisions are lining up and we'll be very selective as we march through that and we'll share more as the year unfolds.", "David Roman", "Okay. That's very helpful. And then on the capital spending side, the $400 million to $450 million at the end of the high end of the range that would be almost a doubling from where you were I think in 2014.", "Could you maybe just help us go into a little bit detail on where those CapEx dollars are going? How much of that are 2016 isolated in nature and what the implications of this additional CapEx are to the rest of the business down the road?", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. I'd say that there is beyond just supporting the operations in the higher growth level that we've got in the company, there is a couple of areas of specific investment.", "One is on in the ERP transformational area, which is strengthening our global ERPs on a world-wide basis and reducing the numbers that we have. So we're on a more consistent common system there.", "The second one is actually we're building a brand new state-of-the-art 3D printing manufacturing facility this year as well too. So we're spending some dollars I think in some key potential growth areas for us and we might want to take advantage of that this year is a little bit of a blip in comparison to what that normal CapEx would be.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "David Lewis", "Good afternoon. Just a couple of question. One, Kevin, just to start off with the Ortho market, I wonder if you could just comment on 2015 if you think about the underlying momentum in the market and your share position, how much relative share you may or may not taken in '15 and how those dynamics in your mind compare to the outlook you'd see for '16 both in terms of how the [audio gap]?", "Kevin Lobo", "\u2026the last three, four years have been in line with the market or maybe slightly below. And I think we're going to start to see a bit of over-performance there behind innovation and launching new products. So we feel good about our position in those two.", "Trauma, of course as you know has been standout for us about four years and we continue to launch new products and we continue to growth very well. So to us the market seems very stable. We like our position in each of the categories.", "If you conclude spine within your definition of orthopedics, I would say that was an area that had been more troubled for us, but we feel we're on a very good path now.", "So across the portfolio and I just had a chance to spend time at the sales meeting for orthopedics and spine, I could tell you they feel very good about our competitive position in a market that seems very stable. So I think we'll see more of the same in terms of volume growth and we like our competitive position.", "David Lewis", "Okay. Thanks Kevin, and just two quick ones. One, just Katherine, just thinking about MAKO for a second, you're now selling more systems than the target MAKO ever did. And I wonder are you seeing any push back on ASP system around a million dollars.", "And in light of one of your competitors acquiring another competitor specifically in robotics, do you expect to see some ASP pressure in '16 or '17?", "And then Bill, you sparked my interest on the 3D printing facility. Is this is a facility that will be capable of doing 3D printed full total knee and hips or is this more derivative products to the orthopedic process? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "On the capital side, obviously, that's always going to be a conversation. You don't sell a million dollar capital easily, but I will tell you we are million dollar capitals. So those robots are sold. They're not placed.", "I think what we're doing is really leveraging the ability to offer different models and we talked about our flex financial. So giving customers the ability to outright purchase or lease depending on their needs and I think that's how helping and it's really I think the difference between when MAKO with standalone is we have a very large selling organization that over the last two years has really come to understand the features and the benefits.", "And the value proposition has only improved going from the knees then to a hip, then to a hip with our hip system is on it and now knowing that total knee will be coming, I think helps in that sales process as well. But we are selling those robots and I don't anticipate that changing in 2016 related to any competition that might be out there.", "Bill Jellison", "And the second part of your question was around 3D printing. So we've launched over the past few years we've started with part of our knee system to enable cementless knee. So tibia base plate. We have this past year in the middle of the year launched revision cones with geometry that can only be made with 3D printing.", "We have our patella that we've launched that's 3D printed and now we're just about to launch a 3D printed titanium interbody device for spine. So all of the products we've launched thus far that our 3D printer are all innovative new products.", "In the case of the spine product and the cementless product it allows for bony in-growth because they're porous materials and getting very good feedback from our customers.", "For the foreseeable future, at least the next three, four years or so, our focus is really on innovative new products and not replacing our existing products with 3D printed products. The pipeline of innovative new geometries that can't be made without 3D printing is the area of focus.", "So it's not about trying to replace our products and drive down cost. Over time ten years from now that could be the case, but in the near to midterm, it's really focused on innovative new products.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi, can you guys hear me okay.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes we can Christina.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay, perfect. So Bill, I'll reiterate definitely congratulations on your retirement we definitely will miss you. So just a question more strategically, I was just wondering if you feel good about the three main buckets that you have now and whether or not Kevin you feel like there is any need to expand beyond that and get into any other white spaces at this point?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, no Kristen I'll be consistent with I will be saying in the past couple of years and our strategy is to stay within these three segments fee. We like our position in these three segments. We want to continue if you look at all of our acquisitions they've strengthened each of our businesses that we're currently in.", "And I think every year we do a white space assessment and the white space assessment is not as attractive as staying within our segments. There are a significant number of targets within our segment. I know we only completed two deals.", "There is a little bit quieter year in 2015, but I can tell you the activity level was no different in 2015 with a lot of deals being discussed and so I would expect us to continue along our current strategy and don\u2019t expect us to suddenly jump into a white space.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay. And then just with respect to the narrow tech area, are there any notable clinical activities coming up for trial readouts or can you speak to any new product pipelines or just think that we should be aware of that could help growth even though obviously it's been going really well.", "Kevin Lobo", "No, we've been with this -- thanks Kristen. We love this business and I would say our coiling and the ischemic stroke were in great shape and we are growing very well in those two categories.", "The one area for Stryker that is slight gap is the flow diverting stent segment. We are selling that outside the U.S. but we don\u2019t yet have U.S. approval. We have in the process of just completing up a trial and we'll be submitting for that, but we're still -- we still have some time before that\u2019s get approved.", "That\u2019s the one area we\u2019re not in. So we're driving this terrific growth without being in that one segment in the United States. So that\u2019s an ongoing process. We'll update you more towards the end of this year in terms of when that will come to market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jason Wittes from Brean Capital. Please go ahead.", "Jason Wittes", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. It sounds like we should view the total knee coming out next year as sort of a transformational product. If I look into this year can you may be highlight some of the products that we should be focused on that really drive that growth this year?", "Katherine Owen", "I would really look at is across the Board very typical Stryker fashion where its more singles and doubles whether it's Endo launching their new 1588 camera or MAKO continuing to drive indications like Hip with the new BS Stryker brand that we talked about or Spine with their new products that are coming out 3D printed.", "So, it\u2019s really a story about those incremental innovative new products. Usually no one on its own is a growth driver. It's the totality of that offering that really allows us to sustain that organic growth at the high end of MedTech.", "Clearly next year we'll set up for some more impactful products that when you think about MAKO and the total Knee and expecting to be on a clear trajectory of taking meaningful market share as work our way through '17.", "Ischemic is one more of those more transformational opportunities. There is a lot of market development that still needs to take place there around the patient path referral systems, hospital -- inter hospital transfer. So we talked about that being a multiyear process, but clearly seeing some very good growth rates, but off of a still small base.", "But I would really think about this year is the typical Stryker story. We've got a lot of products, a lot of momentum, dedicated sales force with especially -- a specialty focus that\u2019s really helping to drive that 5% to 6% growth we're targeting.", "Jason Wittes", "Okay. Very helpful and just a quick follow-up for MAKO can you give us a sense of how many of these new placements are to existing accounts and how many of these de novo? Just kind of\u2026", "Katherine Owen", "We haven\u2019t broken out -- out of the 31, we haven\u2019t broken out, I would tell you though that it is a combination of both existing Stryker customers as well as new customers where we haven\u2019t had any type of meaningful presence. So we haven\u2019t given it with more granularity than that but there is a nice mix.", "Jason Wittes", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Matt Miksic from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Kevin Lobo", "Hello, Matt?", "Operator", "Matt your line is open.", "Matt Miksic", "Sorry about that guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Super job on the numbers it looks like and I'll pass along my congratulations and farewell to Bill. We will also miss you.", "So on MAKO, just a couple of maybe broader questions on how you're positioning the platform. Robotics has been kind of a market development project for a while. Oftentimes dealing with surgeons and helping them get more comfortable with new technology, maybe changing the way surgeries over the long term.", "But what point does this become or has it already become an opportunity to drive better contracting for you across your implant lines, greater share or utilization multi-line contracting driven by the merits of this system and the technology and I've a couple of quick follow-ups?", "Kevin Lobo", "So Matt, I would say, look we're still in the early stages. Stryker hip brands are now available recently and we haven't launched a total knee yet. So I think those are the big applications and to say that it is impacting contracting yet, I would say it's too early for that.", "Once this becomes a more mature business, which will take a couple of years, then I think obviously having a system that if the surgeons are having a great experience and they enjoy it and they want to use the products, it really does provide us with great differentiation, which will -- and differentiation will show up in many different ways including potentially in contracting.", "But we're ways from that yet. We have a lot of work to do in the next couple of years to really gain more broad adoption of the technology.", "Matt Miksic", "Another on the same topic here, Katherine someone asked earlier about hips and what's changing and how you're improving in performance there? To put that in perspective I remember when hips came out and when you first acquired the system, it wasn\u2019t generally thought to be really where the bank for the buck was with the robot.", "And I guess what's changing, is application getting a lot easier, is people getting -- are they proving out the benefits of the hip? What's driving uptake against what was historically viewed as sort of like not the greatest application for the robot?", "Kevin Lobo", "Okay. So I'll take this question. So look when I tell you the first iterations of the hip software were a little bit clumpy and it requires quite a bit more registration time -- you have to register in the software system. So that's just an extra step that some of the surgeons were a little bit frustrated with.", "Over time both prior to our acquisition and subsequent to our acquisition, we've made some enhancements of the software to make it a little bit more user friendly. That's been one factor for sure.", "I think the most compelling factors is showing the surgeons on the pre-imposed X-rays that they put the hip exactly where they want to put it and I think even though surgeons that had some hesitations when they see pre-imposed X-rays, they're just -- it's a very compelling visual for them to understand -- before they weren\u2019t doing that.", "They weren\u2019t able to get that same type of consistency and that's starting to resonate with a lot of surgeons and now being able to put our implants in addition with easier to use software and to get that kind of outcome, it's like all things that change right.", "Change doesn\u2019t occur to everybody at the same time. Some people are early adopters. Some people frankly will never adopt. They\u2019ll just be set in their ways, but what we're seeing is the middle of the bell curve is starting to shift it's mindset and frankly the more of it robotics has talked about in the community at large, we find that actually a very positive thing because we really believe we have a terrific system and we're obviously continuing to invest in that system going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good evening and thank you for taking the question. I have two questions. The first one has to do with 3D printing. It became quite aware that a couple of years ago, now you're definitely doing a bigger focus on that.", "What does it take for a 3D printed call it hip or knee to become more mainstream, is it manufacturing, is it clinical data? How should we think about this evolving?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well it's a long answer Joanne and the reason I pause is to get into all the technology on 3D printing will take a long time. The quick summary is the 3D printing metal is very different than sort of the way you think about 3D printing plastic having it on a desk in an office and cranking out 3D printed products.", "So metal is much more complicated. It's explosive. It requires a lot of extra programming. You just don't buy a machine and sort off to the race as it's a lot more complicated than that and so we spent a lot of time.", "We've been working on this for many, many years and so we have a lot of knowhow on how to program the machines and optimize the machines and so there is a lot of factors that go into it to be able to create and different types of machines work that are for smaller products than larger products.", "So it's difficult for me to just summarize in a short time. I would just say that its more complicated than plastics or other things that you read about in the mainstream press and that\u2019s why for us, our focus is much more on innovative new products and not necessarily replacing total systems that will be many, many, many years ahead of us.", "Joanne Wuensch", "That\u2019s very helpful. As a follow up, what should we expect at the upcoming AAOS? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes Joanne, I think it will be typical to prior years, clearly there is going to be a big focus around MAKO, as we think about Uni as well as Hip, it\u2019s too early in our initial commercial launch activities to have a big focus on user feedback from total knees although I sure that we have lot of surgeon presence around that as they\u2019re looking to get educated on the features and benefits.", "And we\u2019ll have a tour of the booth as we\u2019ve done previously to highlight new products across all the business from Trauma, Foot and Ankle, Spine etcetera and we'll also have an opportunity while we're there just to sit down and meet with management and have a open Q&A forum.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the Raj Denhoy from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Raj Denhoy", "Hi, good afternoon. Wonder if I could ask a question about the CJR, CCJR program that\u2019s rolling out. I know that you guys have been pretty clear as all the companies have that you don\u2019t think it's going to have much impact on pricing and focus on post acute care, which pretty much mirrors the hearing as well.", "But my question is really around how Stryker interfaces with that model? When you perform at solutions business, you guys were involved in some of the bundle payments initiatives before. Is there an opportunity for you guys to perhaps benefit from the CGR program as it rolls out?", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah, we agree with your comments. We don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to have a meaningful impact. We have seen in past with some of our prior program that really does drive to focus on post acute and patients that are discharged right to rehab given the high cost there.", "We do have a small business our Stryker Performance Solutions that we think can help work with hospitals to help to make them aware of the data. So they can have a sense of what best-in-classes and where some of the cost benefits they can realize whether it\u2019s around infection rates, transfusion etcetera. So it's not a huge part of our business, but it is one that provides insights and does help them as they think about their overall cost structure.", "But clearly we continue to believe based on everything we\u2019ve seen that it's going to be a post acute care. We haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change at all in price between those trial areas as it relates to implant pricing and really the cost that savings they can realize focusing on rehab really do dwarf anything else at this point in time.", "Raj Denhoy", "Right. May be just as a follow-up, but if you think about that service offering if that\u2019s the way to describe it, which Performance Solutions certainly does some of, if we should think about the next several years do you envision that service components becoming a bigger part of the business, offering not just implants to hospitals but perhaps something a bit broader?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, that division is continuing to focus on that. It\u2019s not a huge part of our company. I think we see this CCJR is a terrific example and opportunity for us to grow that business but it's not at a scale of which I really want to start highlighting it.", "I would tell you a year from now I think we'll have a much better idea of the scope of CCJR and whether that can become a broader business for us. So services is not something new to Stryker. Well lot of our MedSurg business provides services to hospitals. We have people in the hospitals that our customer pay for to make sure that all their up time is working on their equipment.", "So we're not against services at all, but we don\u2019t sort of like to get out in front of ourselves. Let\u2019s see how this year unfolds and if the business becomes something that could be scalable, then we'll talk about a lot more, but right now it\u2019s a small part. I agree with you that CCJR does provide an exciting opportunity for that business, but it\u2019s a very small part of Stryker.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want to start with M&A, about a year ago Kevin you said you expected to put the balance sheet to work and I just wanted to confirm if that's still the case and I am asking because obviously you've been relatively quiet on the acquisition front over the past 6 to 12 months which is atypical.", "So is there any reason you haven't pulled the trigger on more deals and I had one follow-up. Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure, I would tell you just deal timing is inherently unpredictable. There is absolutely no change in the statement I made before I still intend to put the balance sheet to work.", "The reason we got the extra share buyback approval level was just in case deals don\u2019t get over the line or drag on, for extended periods of time we would start to step up the buybacks, but you should expect us to continue to be very active acquirer, but you\u2019ve seen in the past right sometimes, some years there is one or two deals another years you see many more deals.", "So, our level of activity hasn\u2019t changed. I still see many exciting prospects out there and so we\u2019re staying the course with the existing strategy. ", "Larry Biegelsen", "And then earlier you said that in Q1, you would expect to be at the low end of the 5% to 6% I think constant currency growth rate because of what you\u2019re seeing in emerging markets.", "And so -- but you expect emerging markets to be relatively weak throughout 2016 I believe. So my question is does getting the growth rate up above that the low range in the range does that depend upon an improvement in the emerging market and if not, how do you get that growth rate up? Thanks for taking the questions.", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah, I would just comment that if you look at the cadence of quarters, last year we had some difficult comparisons in the first quarter as related to emerging markets more of the pressure particularly in China unfolded as the year went on.", "We're going to have easier comps in the back half of the year. We tend to have a seasonally stronger second half of the year particular as it relates to the fourth quarter. So it's more just reflective of how our quarters tend to play out in some of the year-over-year comparisons.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.", "Glenn Novarro", "Hi, thanks. Kevin your U.S. Hip and Knee business had a strong fourth quarter of 6% and 9% respectively. Did you see in the fourth quarter the U.S. Orthopedic market accelerate or pickup a bit or do you think that was more share capture from Zimmer given the integration between Zimmer and Biomet and then I had a follow up question on robotics?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, so look until we see everybody report, it's really difficult for me to say how much of it is the market versus comparative share capture. The Knee number, we're encouraged about. We tend to believe our Knee improvement is more driven by the new products, the revision cones and more of uptick of our cementless Knee offering.", "So we believe that\u2019s more of the issue than let's call it sales force disruptions or any other factors that are occurring at other companies. It's more about our innovation.", "When I talk to our field, the sense on getting is a very stable market. So wasn\u2019t -- a few years ago, we saw this big seasonal fourth quarter lift. We'll now we're seeing a typical fourth quarter. This December was more or less typical. Its more active, but was more active a year ago two.", "So we\u2019re not seeing -- we didn\u2019t see anything or major in terms, from quarter-to-quarter you do sometimes see slight upticks or downticks, but until the report it's going to be difficult for me to comment, but I think you had a second question.", "Glenn Novarro", "Yes, Katherine in your prepared remarks you talked about with the MAKO system podium presentations in 2016. So, can you describe what type of presentations -- I\u2019m assuming these are clinical trials, so what type of trials and when can we see these trials being presented? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah, my comments were that we\u2019re going to do observational studies in 2016. So really looking at key opinion leaders who have extensive experience with robotics to understand how we can fine-tune the training protocol and optimize the rollout.", "We\u2019re also going to be doing observational studies with key opinion leaders who have a lot of familiarity with the triathlon system. So we can mesh those two datasets and really put us in a position to have a presence at the podiums in 2017 not '16.", "So we think mining the full commercial launch and being in a position in 2017 for those initial users those key opinion leaders to talk about their experience and how they were able to optimize both the robot as well as our triathlon will help drive the adoption.", "We\u2019re going to continue to collect additional clinical data, but that is going to take our number of years. This is really focused around observational studies to help optimize the training protocol.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Mike Matson from Needham & Company. Please go ahead.", "Mike Matson", "Hi, thanks for fitting me in. I just wanted to start with the new camera at the endoscopy business, how does this compare with the prior model? Is it more of an incremental improvement?", "And just in terms of the impact on the growth rate there, do you expect that to me more of a step change or more of a ramp in terms of the growth and endoscopy and then I have one follow-up?", "Kevin Lobo", "So no, just the 1588, so each term we have a new version and we call it the classrooms 1488 as you know, now we're calling it 1588. Aim is the name of it. I would say it's meaningfully better certainly 1488 had terrific resolution, but we've improved the backlighting and some of the image clarity for certain procedures like E&T.", "So our products works well in wide variety of procedures, but there are certain procedures where highlighting just wasn\u2019t quite as optimized and we made some nice enhancements there. So across the range of procedures surgeons are all going to have a delightful experience whereas in the past it was not necessarily across every specialty that\u2019s the first thing.", "Second thing is we have ICG built into our light source, which we never had before. So with a press of a button, you can light up the organs just I am sure you're familiar with ICG with the comparative product out there.", "But this is not -- doesn\u2019t require extra piece of capital. It's built right into the existing light source, easy for the surgeons to use, which is wonderful. It also includes another product for GYN that lights up parts of the anatomy. So it's really a safe surgery launch.", "And it enables safe surgery with enhanced visualization and we just launched it in December. So, we don\u2019t a huge amount of sales yet, but I would say the earlier clinical feedback has been very positive. So I do expect endoscopy to have a better year in 2016 than they did in 2015.", "Mike Matson", "Okay. Thanks and then just with regard to this big ERP project that you have, what\u2019s the execution risk there that something gets, some balls get dropped in terms of the inventory levels and things like that causing impact on your overall results for the company? Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, so like with any system of implementation there is always some degree of risk. We\u2019re being very thoughtful and careful about how we go about the project. We're staffing -- we're putting our best people on it. They're in dedicated -- in a dedicated workspace.", "And in fact my former Head of HR who also has run businesses is going to be leading the business component of that and I've appointed a new Head of HR that send a terrific signal through the organization of kind commit more making.", "It will be measured launch. So it will take a number of years before complete and we\u2019re starting off with our instruments division and we\u2019re going to continue to -- we have a steady study march plan that we have an IT leader who is partnering with the business leader who has -- was -- had a previous MedTech company doing exactly this kind of an implantation over the past few years.", "So, we believe it's all of our talent staffing the right people who know our business and we\u2019re going to do our best obviously to mitigate the risk. We had a painful experience in Japan a couple of years ago. I can tell you the approach of this project is radically different to the approach we used in that project.", "And so we feel we'll be in good shape and it's not a big bang launch. We\u2019re going to do division by division, region by region and there will be a steady cadence. So even if something does start to wobble a little bit, it should have very, very little impact.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from Barclays Bank. Please go ahead.", "Matt Taylor", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you hear me okay.", "Katherine Owen", "Yep, we can hear you.", "Matt Taylor", "Great. So I was just wondering if you could just follow up on some of those comments on 3D printing and you talked about the materiality of the contributions in the quarter and what you're expecting out that you\u2019re going to be investing more in this new plan? How big is it and how material could that be.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, so for the moment these are innovative products that are adding I'll call it incremental growth. It's not the core growth. The core growth is our big systems right our triathlon or accolade. That\u2019s where the core amount of our sales comes from.", "But this gives a little extra boost and puts a little bit of jump in our sales force step. Gives them something new to talk to the customer about. So, as an example of our vision business lagged -- our market share lagged our primary business in needs by about five or six market share points.", "So we've been in our Stryker friendly account. Sometimes they would go to a competitive -- a competitor to do the revision procedure. Now that we have it, we consider best-in-class revision cones, not only do we keep that business at certain stages with Stryker, we gain that sales, but they're not something that they can go talk to a competitive surgeon about.", "So I would say it's not a huge contributor, but it\u2019s an extra shot in the arm. So with Robotics and 3D printing, we believe we have the lead on both of those areas and those are things we can talk about that differentiate us from our competition.", "So again not -- even today Robotics is not a huge component of our growth or our actual dollar sales, but we believe they are the ones that are causing that extra piece of growth and in a different view of Stryker for the future.", "Over time, I expect Robotics and 3D print to take on a more important portion of our overall sales and there will be sustainable and sticky if we have something that the competition doesn\u2019t have.", "Matt Taylor", "Okay. Great and just one question on the Transatlantic Model, it seems like you\u2019re making some progress there. Can you talk about where you are and how much that's helped to improve some of the OUS results and where you think that could go?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes so look, Europe has exceeded my expectations. We had -- really our international growth doesn\u2019t look fantastic. So you don\u2019t see it, but Europe had a mid-single digit growth year and it improved progressively from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.", "So, that kind of uptick is frankly ahead of where I expected it to be. It\u2019s been masked a little bit because of the sluggishness out of China. So that has dampened our international sales, but it\u2019s been a really great success. I\u2019m excited about what I\u2019m seeing across our businesses in Europe.", "Some of the divisions took off faster than others like trauma, extremities and endoscopy took off really quickly and now I am starting to see some nice uptick in instruments in spine towards the end of the year.", "So more to come in Europe. We made a number of investments over the course of the year. Those investments are now taking hold and I think you will start to see Europe become a division that delivers better topline and starts to deliver some leverage going forward.", "We\u2019ve added Canada. So those are now directly managed, a division President has direct P&L accountability for Canada, the U.S. and Europe. The other regions we haven\u2019t yet folded into the model, but by eliminating the Group President of international role, we now have them reporting directly to our Business Group President.", "So it just increases speed and connectivity from our regions to come straight to a Group President.", "Over time, we\u2019ll see whether those countries will roll into this model, but we don\u2019t want to run too fast to fully integrate a complete global business units especially with markets like China that are so different or Japan.", "But we\u2019re very pleased with the progress so far, taking out that position puts nothing about cost reduction that was 100% just to increase speed and connectivity of those countries to our business.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Matt Keeler from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Matt Keeler", "Hey guys thanks for taking the questions. Just two quick ones first on Hips outside the U.S. you highlighted the drag from emerging markets, but your Knee growth actually picked up pretty nicely.", "So I\u2019m just wondering if there was a much more pronounced impact from that emerging market to drag on Hips relative to Knees and if there were any other factors that impacted your Hip business outside the U.S.?", "Kevin Lobo", "No, nothing particular. You see this from quarter-to-quarter and sometimes you will see sort of Hips jump in the case of Hips, Canada is an example there was a Hip tender that we lost. So that accounted for some of the Hip growth.", "There is not one overwriting factor. It\u2019s sort of a story by story, country by country and we see this from quarter-to-quarter. Sometimes you'll see Knee -- our business is not as big outside the U.S.", "So you do see a little bit more volatility in our numbers whether its Hips, Knees, Spine. Once those businesses get larger you should expect that there will be less volatility.", "Matt Keeler", "Great. Thanks and just lastly instruments growth was pretty strong in the quarter, but I think you highlighted that business is later on in its product cycle. So just wondering if you think the level of growth we saw in the fourth quarter if that's sustainable going forward and what are some of the products to watch where you are maybe little later on in that product cycle?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes so the Power Tools is the product that we refer to as being late in the cycle. The system setting power tools, which is probably the biggest single product category within instruments but instruments has a lot of other products.", "So they have Neptune. They're launching a new signature line of drills. We actually report that as part of a neurotech, but it\u2019s run by our instruments division, but yes they have the sponge counter as well patient safety company that we acquired.", "So these are different kinds of businesses that can drive growth. It\u2019s a little less predictable in Power Tools. So I think we're very excited by how they finished the year. They finished the year very, very strong and we think they will have a good year, but longer in the cycle sometimes we do see them tailing off a little bit. So I would expect the year that's similar to the year that they had this year overall.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Rich Newitter from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.", "Rich Newitter", "Hi thanks for squeezing me in. Kevin, I was hoping just to get some comments on spine. You characterized the market as stable and you\u2019re clearly seeing some nice uptick in the growth rates there yes into product launches.", "So my question really is has there been any change or can you give us your updated thoughts on how you view external versus internal investments in this division for you, now that things seem to be on better footing?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, so I\u2019m really excited about what we're doing organically. So we\u2019ve re-tooled our R&D organization, some of our marketing organization over the past few years and this business is hitting its stride and we're launching more and more new products. We\u2019re getting into MIS which was an area that we were softer in before, if you look back three, four years ago.", "And so it's great to see the organic growth. Organic growth obviously is much more financially attractive than going out and spending a lot of money on companies. Over time I do want this to become a bigger division and I think it's likely to see a combination of both organic and acquisitions, but it's always better to have a strong organic business.", "And so I do not feel at all that I need to do an acquisition because of the strength in what we've started to build internally, but that's something that will likely happen over time.", "Rich Newitter", "Okay. Thanks, and then just on extremity again your Foot and Ankle growth, I think you said it was 20% that this business continues to truck along. Any comments on the end markets versus potential share gains that we might have seen in the quarter and specially are you seeing any disruptions from recent M&A in the field? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah, I would just say these are markets that continue to be very healthy growing double digits. We do believe we\u2019re taking market share. We\u2019ve got a dedicated sales focus there, some great products. I wouldn\u2019t call it any disruptions that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. I think it\u2019s just continues to be really good execution in a market that has favorable underlying growth dynamics.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Joshua Jennings from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Joshua Jennings", "Hi, good evening. Thank you. Kevin I just wanted -- hoping you touch on pricing. I think recently you had some public commentary about some potential moderation in the pricing headwinds that you've historically been experiencing.", "Any comments in terms of assumptions for pricing headwinds within guidance and any outlook for pricing particularly in Orthopaedics.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, so you saw for the full year our price did moderate somewhat from the prior year and there was a lot of concern as we exit, if you remember as we\u2019re exiting '14 there was a lot of concern that the pricing was going to accelerate in '15.", "In fact it hasn\u2019t it actually moderated a little bit, but it\u2019s modest, right, the moderation is very modest and in our guidance we suggest that the price will be between 1.5% to 2%.", "And so I would say it's a stable market. We\u2019ve continued to have price pressure. It's not going away, but we don\u2019t see any accelerators to that price pressure and that\u2019s why we feel it's going to be pretty stable going into 2016.", "Joshua Jennings", "Great, and just one follow up on MAKO, we haven\u2019t heard much over the last year on the Uni Knee product. Any commentary there in terms of how its contributing to growth in your Knee franchises and just overall growth for that product line. Thanks a lot.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thanks. Obviously the Unit market when its put in the context of overall Stryker its very small part of the overall business and I would say it's just -- it\u2019s a steady contributor but there is nothing remarkable to say about it. It\u2019s a good business, but it\u2019s a very small part of our overall need.", "Katherine Owen", "Are you just talking Josh specifically for MAKO.", "Kevin Lobo", "No, he got\u2026", "Katherine Owen", "So for MAKO it\u2019s the first indication. They\u2019re continuing to drive uptake for that as well as with Hip and as we get additional indication, I think it helped us. It does help drive adoption as some customers were not interested in just the Uni, but as we get more indications, they\u2019re starting to adapt for that as well as the others.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, but I\u2019m just trying to interrupt sorry that Josh got cut off just to interrupt that the growth to 9% in the U.S. that\u2019s spike in growth. It really wasn\u2019t driven by MAKO or Uni. That\u2019s driven more by the broader Knee business.", "Operator", "And next question comes from the Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking questions. Just quickly on MAKO again, the number of systems you placed internationally accelerated here in Q4. Was there anything that you can call out as far as maybe a little bit of tipping point in terms of interest in the robotic system, OUS and maybe that could be an even more meaningful contributor here in 2016?", "Katherine Owen", "No, still the lion's share of the focus and the revenue was coming from the U.S. and get place more systems outside the U.S. and we'll continue to focus on those opportunities particularly places like Australia and certain other markets, but the bulk of the revenue stream has been and will likely continue at least near term to be U.S.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah, it tends to be a country by country thing. So Australia had a terrific year in robot sales. I think within Europe we\u2019re going to see certain countries are going to adopt MAKO much more quickly than other countries.", "So I think each year you'll see the international volume starting to increase, but it might be Italy this year. It might be the U.K. next year, over the next few years, but again to Katherine\u2019s point the market that\u2019s the most important by far is going to the U.S. market.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Okay. And then just to follow-up a little bit on Richard\u2019s question, a little more broadly on trauma and extremities, I think we saw some acceleration here in Q4 beyond what we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters.", "And I\u2019m just curious if that acceleration was specific to any couple of products or geographies around particularly the U.S. and if that level of growth is something that you think is sustainable here in 2016?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well I think you\u2019ve seen our trauma business in the U.S. it's been four years of really terrific growth. So that to me is sustainable when you\u2019re growing at that level. So we\u2019re very pleased.", "We\u2019ve rounded our portfolio completely and so that enables us to do complete hospital conversions something that was impossible with Stryker five, six years ago. Europe really picked up quickly. So as we move to the Transatlantic Model, I was very encouraged by our trauma success in Europe.", "We have not been nearly as successful in Europe as we have been in the United States and we do now have the same products, which are all approved. So I think -- I expect more commercial success in Europe as well as Japan.", "Now some of those products take a little longer to get approved in Japan. So I think that once those products start to arrive, we will start to see more of an uptick in Japan as well.", "But I would say we are in very good position in that business. We have a very, very strong leadership team and we expect to continue to have success in trauma extremities.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. Please go ahead.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good afternoon and Bill just once best wishes I was looking back this afternoon I think it has been 14 years that you and I have overlapped. So thanks for all the conversation, all the help over that time.", "And so Kevin just wanted to ask just question, one follow-up question here just on the phasing or maybe gaiting of some of the MedTech tax savings.", "Is there going to be any timing differential between when the MedTech tax savings start coming and influencing the cost of goods line versus when you start reinvesting those dollars back into SG&A and R&D. Should those match pretty evenly out of P&L or just how to think about the gaiting throughout this year?", "Kevin Lobo", "I think that that\u2019s fair to say Jeff and thanks a lot for your comments. I think that on the cost of goods sold category obviously that will start to write off in the beginning of the year. Our investments as we are targeting right now moving again through 2016, we would also expect to be doing that in reinvestment pretty much consistently throughout the year.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right. That's all I have.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sorry, it\u2019s going to be clean from the beginning of the year, from the beginning of this year to 2017. It starts immediately. There is no lag effect which I think had happened prior with the different companies. So for us it's clean. You will see it cleanly in the two years.", "Jeff Johnson", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Steve Lichtman from Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.", "Steve Lichtman", "Thanks guys. I actually just have one follow-up on ERP, you talked about the investment on the capital side. Are there any P&L impacts that we should expect over the next couple of years as you start to implement ERP and when do you anticipate the system being fully in place?", "Kevin Lobo", "So a couple of different questions again there. So on the ERP side of the equation, from an investment perspective we won\u2019t see the first implementations really for about another year and half or so and then those will be rolled out over the next few years after that.", "As far as the cost side of equation goes, we would not expect that to be a big blip once we get to kind of the stabilized level that we've got in 2016 here, but moving forward and in fact if anything as those systems are implemented we would expect some of the benefits plus with the CTG initiatives that we've got kicked off, those will continue to roll in at different points throughout different years.", "We do have multi hundreds of millions of dollars targeted for that. Keep in mind as well that we have price downs in the $150 million to $200 million range that we need to be working to offset and then as far as the impacts associated with the investment, again that should be pretty consistent as we're moving forward beyond 2016.", "Bill Jellison", "Yes just to add to that, I would say we do have some expense that will be hitting our P&L, but we\u2019re absorbing that within the guidance that we have provided to you.", "Steve Lichtman", "Got it, thanks. That\u2019s all I had, thanks guys.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Kaila Krum from William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Kaila Krum", "Hi guys. Just a couple of quick ones for me. The first clearly you all are still emphasizing M&A as a key priority herein. I am just curious if you can touch on how or if those conversations have changed tone, just with some evaluation pull back specifically that we've seen in recent weeks?", "Katherine Owen", "Yeah, I would say that that shorter time period doesn\u2019t have an impact and as Kevin articulated we continue to be focused on M&A externally. There is going to be periods where it looks or less active depending on timing.", "Internally the teams have never been busier and there is no change in the strategy and the recent market disruption is what it is.", "Kaila Krum", "Okay. And then I guess just to follow-up on an earlier question just around whether or not there is this potential for longer term growth rate to accelerate and then just pairing that with your earlier comments about MAKO and likelihood that 2016 is more of a setup year for 2017, is it fair to assume that overall topline growth could modestly accelerate heading into 2017 from 2015 levels?", "Katherine Owen", "It's always our goal to grow sales at the high end of MedTech and certainly we've got some nice opportunities between ischemic and MAKO, and that's going to be in early stages next year.", "So probably premature to start to push towards higher growth rates in this year, but we feel really good with what we've set up for this year and hopefully can build on that in '17.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yeah and I think we're going to learn a lot. So I think towards the end of this year, we'll be able to share more of the two additional platforms, both MAKO and ischemic drove closer to one, but I think can provide let's call them change of factories and growth for the company.", "Now whatever happens in '17, or '18, or '19 is there are new platforms. So it's not easy to predict, but I think we'll learn a lot over the course of this year and certainly be able to share more with you when we provide our guidance in the following year.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2016 results will be held on April 20. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Baird & Company", "Josh Jennings - Cowen and Company", "Operator", "Welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Stryker Earnings Call. My name is Liz and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with SEC. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "Welcome to Stryker's first quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, who assumed the role of CFO effective April 1, and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call, I will provide opening comments, followed by an M&A update from Katherine. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A. ", "We're pleased with our start to the year, as Q1 organic sales growth of 6.1% came in above our expectations, with strong performances across all three segments: Orthopedics, MedSurg and neurotechnology and spine. The performance was led by continued new product introductions and strong sales and marketing execution. ", "Geographically, Q1 was powered by ongoing momentum in the U.S., with sales growth of 8.9%. As expected, growth was challenged outside the U.S., given the tough year-over-year comparisons in emerging markets, where growth started to slow in the second quarter of last year. Challenges still exist in emerging markets, although the year-over-year impact should ease in the back half of the year. ", "We continue to have good performance in Europe, Japan and Australia. Our strategy of business unit specialization with dedicated sales forces, marketing and R&D continue to be a differentiating factor in the sustainability of our above-market growth. Consistent R&D investment has generated strong internal product pipelines across the Company and we continue to augment them with acquisitions.", "We're thrilled to welcome Sage, Physio-Control and Synergistics to Stryker and believe that the addition of these companies will further strengthen our businesses. Looking at the P&L, we're building on 2015's success and delivered solid adjusted earnings growth of 11.7%, despite modest foreign currency headwinds. This improvement stemmed from the strong top-line and year-over-year gross margin expansion. Importantly, we continue to invest heavily in R&D in both absolute dollars and as a percent of sales.", "Our cost transformation for growth efforts are in the early stages and are multiyear nature and we're starting to realize benefits. Overall, we're confident in our stated goal of achieving sales at the high end of medtech, with ongoing earnings leverage and believe our Q1 results position us well for 2016.", "I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on providing an update on MAKO along with the two larger M&A deals we recently closed on, Sage and Physio-Control. With respect to MAKO, we sold seven robots during the quarter globally which is in line with the same period a year ago. As many of you know, capital sales tend to be the strongest in the fourth quarter and also can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We're highly encouraged by order trends which reinforces the growing interest and demand for the MAKO robotic system, fueled by the expanded indications and planned launch of the Total Knee system, where we continue to target full commercial rollout in 2017.", "There is no change to our launch plans for the Total Knee which will focus throughout 2016 on working with key opinion leaders to optimize the training protocol and gather observational data that will help to frame the anticipated benefits, all of which will ensure a strong podium presence at key orthopedic meetings as we move throughout 2017. In Q1, we're also encouraged by the robust procedure growth in both partial knees and hips using MAKO. ", "Turning to the recent M&A activity, in early April, we closed on both Sage and Physio-Control which will be integrated into our medical division. Starting with Sage, our focus will be to ensure the continuation of strong double-digit top-line growth that the Company has had a long history of achieving. With their market-leading product portfolio, focus on clinically supported innovation, product ease-of-use and strong sales support, we believe Sage can continue to drive both market expansion and share gain in the prevention of hospital-acquired conditions. Given our existing global footprint which includes strong and broad sales and marketing support, we believe that over time, Stryker can help drive adoption of the Sage portfolio outside the U.S., where revenue to date is limited as the Company had historically focused its investment in the U.S. market.", "Regarding Physio-Control, we believe we have significant opportunities over time to drive both sales and earning synergies, given our combined presence in the pre-hospital setting. In the near term, both businesses will operate largely independently, with a focus on their respective 2016 target and planned key new product launches.", "Importantly for both Sage and Physio-Control, we have identified and put in place a highly experienced integration team which, given our BD history, should help ensure a smooth integration. As we move through the first 12 months post closing of both Sage and Physio-Control, we will provide you with the pro forma quarterly growth rates for each to help provide visibility regarding our execution and their top-line contribution. There is no change to our previously announced expected accretion from both these transactions to adjusted EPS in 2016 and 2017 of $0.07 and $0.15 to $0.18, respectively.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Thanks, Katherine. My comments on today's call will focus on the financial results and key drivers of our first quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in the various schedules included in today's press release. As to our overall performance, our constant currency organic sales growth of 6.1% exceeded the high end of our full-year expectations and came in better than our expectations at the start of the quarter. The growth, based on the same number of selling days, reflected strong U.S. volume and mix of 10.2%, marginally offset by pricing which was slightly negative, at 1.3%. Adjusted EPS of $1.24 increased 11.7% from 2015, primarily driven by our strong top-line growth and favorable margin performance.", "Foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.02 per share, roughly in line with our guidance. Looking at our segment highlights orthopedics' constant currency growth was 4.6% which was led by U.S. orthopedics growth of 7.9%, reflecting continued strong sales in our trauma and extremity business which grew 11% and a 9% increase in knees, reflecting continued momentum from our last quarter and the success of our Triathlon products, driven by our Tritanium revision cones, our cementless knee products, as well as new customer adoption of our MAKO [indiscernible] platform. We're now seeing an acceleration in our revision implant sales, where previously our market share lagged our overall total knee share. Partly offsetting the strong U.S. orthopedic performance was the continued challenging markets in China and Brazil which contributed to the negative 1.4% constant currency decline in international.", "Overall, our first quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our orthopedics portfolio. Our MedSurg segment, with constant currency growth of 4.6%, also demonstrated strong momentum, with U.S. growth of 7.6%. Instruments had solid U.S. growth of 10.2%, with good performance in their waste management products. Endoscopy's new 1588 camera which features enhanced visualization that broadens the applicable surgical applications, was a primary driver for the division's solid performance and will continue to be a growth engine in 2016. Lastly, medicals growth which was up against a tough year-over-year comparable, benefited from strong demand for its market-leading stretcher and ambulance cot products which underscored the strength of its portfolio and the overall health and stability of hospital capital budgets that we're seeing in the market.", "As with orthopedics, MedSurg also experienced challenges in emerging markets, primarily China. We expect this to continue as we work through our distributors to drive demand and reduce the buildup of their inventories, recognizing comparisons will also ease as we move through 2016. All in all, our MedSurg businesses saw healthy order growth in the first quarter and should be well positioned to continue their momentum. Turning to neurotechnology and spine, the impressive year-end momentum achieved by this group continued in the first quarter, with 13.1% constant currency growth. Neurotechnology's 21% growth was highlighted by the developing market for device-based treatment of ischemic stroke. While there's still considerable market development required, we're highly encouraged by the potential for this segment and our Trevo stent retriever technology.", "As one of two major stent retrievers on the market, combined with compelling clinical data underscoring the efficacy of these devices, such as the MR CLEAN study, Stryker is well positioned for growth in neurovascular. We also continue to see excellent performance in our neuro-powered instruments business, led by strong growth in their signature drill products released last year. We also are encouraged by the solid showing up for spine, up 5.8% in the U.S. as new product launches, including a limiting launch of our 3D-printed interbody device, are clearly having an impact. Neurotechnology and spine continue to benefit from a new product pipeline resulting from robust R&D investment over the past few years. I will now focus on our first quarter operating highlights, starting with gross margin which on an adjusted basis increased 240 basis points to 68%. Of this improvement, roughly a quarter relates to the two-year suspension of the medical device tax, while the remainder reflects a favorable mix and favorable foreign exchange, partly offset by negative pricing.", "As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation, with R&D at 6.4% of sales which is in line with our overall target spend. On an adjusted basis, SG&A increased to 37.4% of sales versus 35.9% in the prior period which was driven by increased selling activity, anticipated spending related to our new ERP deployment efforts and reinvestment of the medical device tax. Looking ahead, we expect SG&A on a full-year basis to be comparable to 2015. Overall, our operating margin increased 90 basis points, reflecting solid top-line growth and favorable mix and gross margins, offset slightly by higher SG&A for the quarter. Lastly, some financial highlights on the other income and expense. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings during the quarter, primarily to fund our recently completed Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. Net interest expense will continue to be higher than Q1, as our borrowing incurred at the end of Q1.", "Our first quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.4% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure and the permanent renewal of certain tax extenders which was included in our guidance. Moving onto the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, with $7.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 17.2% was held in the U.S. This balance reflects $3.5 billion of proceeds related to our previously mentioned debt offering which is included in the $7.5 billion of debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, $4.1 billion of cash was used to fund the Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash flow from operations for 2015 was $2 billion compared to $4 billion last year, as we made $0.1 billion of payments associated with our rejuvenated and AVG II recall. Approximately 50% of the funding for the Rejuvenate liability is being sourced from O-U.S. cash. Finally, as we have previously announced, we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year. With that, I will move on to our guidance. Based on our first quarter performance, we now expect our full-year organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions in the range of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment we experienced in 2015. Finally, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.65 to $5.80 for the full year and $1.33 to $1.38 for the second quarter.", "Now I will open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first call comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.", "David Lewis", "So a couple of questions, Kevin just first off, just talk about the guidance. Obviously, the quarter was strong and it's a little early in the year, obviously, to raising your organic sales estimate, so obviously you have some conviction in the back half. As I think about the back half of the year, obviously medical comparables are going to get a little easier, emerging markets pressure should also ease. Is there anything else that you see in the business broadly across Stryker that is giving you the confidence in the raise to the organic sales guidance heading into the back half of the year?", "Kevin Lobo", "I would say that I feel very good about the strength of our entire business portfolio. So if you look at MedSurg, you look at neurotechnology and even orthopedics, I really feel like we have balanced strength across our portfolio and that balanced strength is what gives us the confidence, even after the first quarter, to raise our organic sales guidance. So we had indicated previously that the first quarter would likely be closer to the 5% range and we exceeded that. And obviously, the emerging market comps will also ease as we get into the back half. So we're feeling very good about our position as we exit the first quarter and obviously feel confident about raising our organic sales guidance.", "David Lewis", "Okay. Maybe just two quick follow-ups, maybe, for Katherine, one, I know obviously the neuro number was very strong in the quarter. There's a lot of focus on stent retriever, but can you just give us a sense, Katherine, where you stand on pipeline opportunities within neuro, specifically interventional neuro? And secondarily, is there any reason to believe MAKO capital sales get harder into the full knee launch that could be sort of a delayed effect until people see the full evidence and software in the back half of the year? Or based on order patterns, you remain pretty comfortable? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. So within neuro tech, the bulk of the revenue is still from the hemorrhagic side and we continue to launch next generation of the coils, different sizes, different shapes and continue to launch into additional geographies. And we're the market leader in that segment of the market. We do have a flow diverter on the market outside the U.S. It's in clinical in the U.S. We're probably still a year or two before U.S. market launch of that product, but that will clearly be an important product launch, given that they have captured a portion of the coil market where they are applicable. And then continuing to invest in ischemic stroke, although candidly a lot of what's going to have to happen over the next few years in the ischemic segment has more to do with market development, as Glenn mentioned in his comments.", "On MAKO, nothing that I would bring up to suggest that placements will get harder and if anything, the economic and value proposition associated with the robot as we move toward full commercial launch of the Total Knee indication only gets greater. So we expect to see continued strong demand. As we've talked about, this year is really focused on training. So that's going to be to ensure an optimal rollout and to make sure the initial user experience is as positive as it can be, but we would assume continued momentum. And as I mentioned, we're really pleased with incoming order trends.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. You may proceed.", "Mike Weinstein", "A couple quick questions, there were two things that probably surprised us in the quarter. One would have obviously been the gross margin which was well above expectations and recent trends. And I was hoping you could spend a minute on why that was. And then second is just the sustainability of the growth we're seeing in the neurovascular business. We showed no signs of slowing at the U.S. international this quarter. And rather than same development trends from 2015 on the back of the data and the guideline changes, anything else you could add would be helpful.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. Mike, I will start off with the neurovascular and then I will turn it over to Glenn for the gross margin. So certainly, the ischemic market, it's a new market and there obviously are many strokes that hadn't been treated prior. I kind of think this a little bit like the foot and ankle market, you are creating a new market. And when you create a new market, it's difficult to predict the pace of growth, but there's no doubt that the growth will be very significant and that was clearly the biggest contributor to the strong performance in neurovascular but equally pleased with the performance of our neuro-powered instruments which are having fantastic growth.", "Very strong double-digit growth with our signature drills which compete with one of the other major players. And we're taking significant market share with those products as well as our Sonopet product. So very strong performance, both in neurovascular as well as the neuro-powered instruments and even our craniomaxillofacial business, the third of our neuro businesses, is enjoying double-digit growth. So across the neuro portfolio, we're really performing very well. I will turn it to Glenn for gross margin.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes, I think if you look at our gross margin, we really benefited from a positive mix relative to U.S. and international. And then even relative to newer products over some of our older products, if you look at the 1588 and the signature drills that were sold, those sell at largely premiums. And then finally, we also continue to see sort of our stalwart product, knees, trauma, our ischemic stroke and coil products continue to sell fairly robustly, too which help lift the overall margin up.", "Kevin Lobo", "And price was also more moderate than we've seen in the past.", "Mike Weinstein", "Right. Glenn, it also looked like your inventories were up a lot this quarter from the end of the year. Any expectation on those trending down? So what I'm asking is any of the uptick in gross margin here one time or do you want us to view it as sustainable?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "No, I think the inventories up were just -- it's reflecting what we're planning for the rest of the year in making sure that we're able to satisfy customers. And as far as the gross margin goes, we expect that we will continue to see this kind of trend throughout the year.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed.", "Bob Hopkins", "So the first question I wanted to ask is on the business outside the United States. Specifically, could you comment a little bit on the performance of your knee business outside the United States which was the one slightly weak spot within the ortho business? And then also, Kevin, I was wondering if you could just comment on Europe broadly from a capital equipment perspective because we've seen some other healthcare companies that sell capital equipment into Europe talk about a tough environment. I was wondering if you could just offer a broad comment on Europe from a capital equipment perspective and then also on the O-U.S. knee business. Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure, Bob. So on both businesses, I would tell you we don't have significant businesses, as you probably know. In capital equipment in Europe, our market share is quite low. And even for knees, if you look at last year, we had a pretty good comp. We had a plus-5% in knee. And quarter to quarter, given that we don't have very large businesses for both capital equipment in Europe and knees, we do tend to see fluctuations.", "So I would call this sort of the normal fluctuations that we get quarter to quarter. And we're not really seeing a lot of difficulty with capital equipment. That market for us in Europe, given that the bulk of our capital is not the large capital, we're not really seeing any new pressures. And we see the Europe market as being fairly healthy, at least for our businesses. Keep in mind, though, that we do have very low market shares and we have significant room to grow within both Europe as well as O-U.S. knees.", "Bob Hopkins", "And then on emerging markets, I think the last couple of quarters, the business has been, as you expected, down about mid-single digits. Was that the same sort of growth rate that you saw this particular quarter? And can you just give us a little more color on the math and rationale for the expectation that perhaps in the back half, things get a little bit better?", "Kevin Lobo", "So Bob, the emerging markets actually was -- the decrease was even more pronounced in the first quarter, so it was negative high-single digits in the first quarter. And that didn't surprise us because we had a very strong first quarter last year. Things really started to tail off starting in the second quarter last year. So that really contributed to the softness in our international sales was the negative growth in emerging markets and we do see that starting to taper and obviously the comps will ease as well. Inventory bleeds will eventually bleed out. It's hard to predict exactly when, but as I stated I think on our last call, we expect around midyear would be sort of the bottoming out period and we should start to see improvements in the second half of the year.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. You may proceed.", "Rick Wise", "Kevin, you've been very pointed in focusing us on the potential for more operating leverage in the P&L. We saw it this quarter with 90 basis points of positive leverage. When I look back at the last couple of years, you've had a couple of quarters where we have seen 100 basis points year-over-year improvement, but then it's not sustained. How do we think about this performance in the first quarter? Is it sustainable, is there more to come and is that the right way to think about the 2016, 2017 direction in terms of driving leverage?", "Kevin Lobo", "I would tell you that if you look at our earnings guidance, it's pretty clear that we're driving leverage. So we've updated both our top-line guidance. We've also updated our bottom-line guidance. And this is the third time since the beginning of the year that we've raised our earnings guidance and we won't be able to deliver that type of earning guidance unless we drive operating leverage. So I'm not going to promise that is going to be 90 basis points every single quarter, but we're committed to driving leverage at the operating income level. And you will see that this year and you'll see that when we provide guidance for you in 2017.", "Rick Wise", "And just following up on the knee performance which was really excellent clearly, I know there are multiple pieces here, Triathlon is doing well, revision. Maybe remind us of your current mix of revision versus primary knee, that mix. How does it differ from industry averages or aspirational norms? And is the story in knees, at least in part, the new products you showed us at AOS are going to drive us toward those norms? Or how should we think about it? Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure, yes. There are multiple factors that contribute to the knee performance. We had a great fourth quarter, with around 9% growth in the U.S. and another 9% in the first quarter. And certainly revision is part of it. And we've launched these new 3D-printed cones in the middle of last year and cones are a very important part of the procedure. They don't generate huge revenue by themselves, but you get the pull-through of the implant when you use the cones. ", "Our market share was roughly 6 share points below what it was in primary knees and revision. So we did sell in the revision market, but we didn't maintain the same level of market share that we do with our primary knees, roughly 6 points. So we're really excited about being able to gain those 6 points back and then potentially even grow beyond that. Because we really believe we now have the best-in-class cones for revision procedures. We also have cementless knees which is growing and that is through a launch of our 3D-printed Tritanium baseplate. The baseplate portion of our knee system, that's a second factor.", "A third factor is really great sales force execution. Marketing programs and sales force execution. So it's hard for me to describe which of those three is the greater. I would say all three contributed to a very strong showing in knees and it's the second quarter in a row. And I really believe we're building momentum and that will continue to perform well in knees through the course of the year.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of David Roman with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.", "David Roman", "I was hoping you could talk about the trauma business in the U.S. and Kevin, that's a franchise that you have mentioned in a couple different public settings that you weren't convinced that you could necessarily outgrow the market to the extent to which you have over the past several quarters. But that does look like it is continuing here, especially in the U.S. Can you maybe just help us think through some of the drivers that are supporting the sustainability of growth in that franchise? And how we should evaluate that on a go-forward basis?", "Kevin Lobo", "Look, I'm thrilled with the performance of our trauma business and it's been a multiyear success story. We posted this plus-11% against a comp of plus-18% in the prior period, so we really are clicking on all cylinders within our trauma portfolio. It took us years to build out our portfolio, frankly, on the plating side of the business. We've always been strong in nails and then of course the launching of our foot and ankle business was tremendous a few years ago and that continues to grow above the overall trauma growth rate. It was midteens growth again this quarter. And very strong performance from the STAR Ankle as well, so I would say it's rounding out our portfolio and then terrific sales force execution.", "And again, it's been a three-year story. My only caution on trauma is really being able to maintain 15%, 16% growth quarter after quarter for years is just challenging. The law of numbers at some point you would think would start to catch up with you and just moderate the growth rate. But I have every confidence we will continue to grow above market and we demonstrated that most likely in the first quarter. Of course, not everybody has reported yet, but we feel that's a very strong showing.", "David Roman", "Maybe just a follow-up on the cash flow side for Glenn, if I look at the operating cash flow and free cash flow numbers that you've disclosed for the quarter, it looks like quite a bit of capital deployed toward operating items and you are not converting all that much of your net income to free cash flow. Are there any one-time factors that may have negatively influenced Q1 that would reverse themselves through the balance of the year, whereby you can start growing cash flow in line with adjusted net income?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes, the biggest thing that we really we can't necessarily control the timing of is really the Rejuvenate payments that we made related to the recall. So we made a payment of $0.1 billion in Q1 and don't expect that based on what we've seen in the past that that could necessarily repeat itself throughout the year.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. You may proceed.", "Richard Newitter", "I was hoping start off with spine. Kevin, can you give us any color on -- you've had two quarters now or three quarters of improving growth there above the market. I know you have some new product launches and a nice pipeline and that is I'm sure helping. Can you break out for us at all is the acceleration that carried over into the first quarter volume related, mix related? Are you getting share or is it just purely you have new products and you are getting premium pricing?", "Kevin Lobo", "I would say it's mostly volume. There is obviously some mix when you launch innovative products. We just had a limited launch of our 3D-printed interbody device and we're getting fantastic feedback on that. And that obviously sells at a price premium. So there is a mix of components as well, but I would say it's mostly volume. And it is volume coming from the products that most of which we launched last year.", "We launched a slew of new products and those are being well adopted in the marketplace. I would say price continues to be pressured. Spine is the most pressured pricing division within Stryker and we believe that our price is roughly in line with the market. So the fact that we're growing above market now I think is four quarters in a row is really driven by a renewed focus on launching products and having great sales force execution. So I believe we will have another strong year just like we did last year in spine in 2016.", "Richard Newitter", "Okay. And then just one more on bundled payments. It's officially kicked off now that we're in April. Just wondering if you had any updates on ways or areas where you are working with or partnering with hospitals or how you are leveraging something that is unique about what Stryker can do in terms of partnering? Is there anything that you are doing more aggressively or hearing from customers that is resonating or allowing you to potentially differentiate and gain share with this new dynamic that's playing out in the market? Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. So we have a division within Stryker called Stryker Performance Solution which has consulted with over 100 hospitals the past three years to improve service line performance, including areas directly impacted by bundled payments. So through these engagements, we've developed deep insight into the profitability and opportunities that hospitals have within orthopedics. We were also granted convener status by CMS last year as part of the bundled payment BPCI program. And we're actively taking risk with five institutions across multiple hospitals on the payment bundling, managing over $55 million in episode spend.", "With CJR, third parties like us are not allowed to operate as a convener anymore with the Medicare program. But our Stryker Performance Solution is still providing consulting services to hospitals to help them address the challenges of managing the bundle. So we have a lot of experience. We're continuing to help and consult with our customers. And what I tell you is the initial focus is really much more on the post-acute care. That's where the majority of the cost of the procedure is and the biggest opportunity in the short term is addressing post-acute care. But having this division which is headquartered in Chicago, has been a key asset for us. We have a lot of insights into the economics of the orthopedic service line and how to help our customers address this new world.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. You may proceed.", "Matt Taylor", "I was wondering in the last couple quarters, you've actually had better pricing or less declines. Has there been any change in the market where you would really call a trend, whether it is consolidation or new products broadly that have helped on price?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I would say obviously pricing is still negative. It is modestly less negative coming in at 1.3%, but we're still very close to the 1.5% to 2% range. So we wouldn't call out anything significant that is indicative of a change in the overall pricing dynamic. Typically consolidation helps, but again it's still negative. We have seen it vary quarter to quarter. Sometimes it's trended above. Fortunately, more recently, it's been trending on the lower end. I would say the outlook seems very stable and really no new dynamics that we see putting further pressure on pricing.", "Matt Taylor", "The other thing people talk about with CCJR is just more procedures moving to outpatient or just getting people out in the hospital quicker or moving to lower acuity settings. So I guess you mentioned your consulting division, but how else are you positioning yourself or is your product portfolio positioned to capture that trend or be competitors in that kind of vector?", "Katherine Owen", "I really think the way we're best positioned to help our customers is going to be through some of the insights that we've had, having this division now for a number of years within Stryker and understanding the economics. And the focus on post-acute care, given that eats up the bulk of the cost when you are looking at an episode of care. So we're able to work with them in that regard. But I wouldn't say there is a unique product offering that facilitates or is advantageous in the post-acute setting, if I'm understanding the question correctly.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Just to follow up a little bit on Matt's question on the CJR, I am curious if there's been any kind of either disruption from that program going into place earlier this month, be it with MAKO. Or potentially here in Q2, maybe seeing a little less volume as a result or if maybe some hospitals as they were preparing for it started to do more cases in Q1 and there was a benefit, specifically in Q1, in anticipation of that program going into place.", "Kevin Lobo", "No, I wouldn't describe any of the change in Q1 to the CJR. Keep in mind that CJR is not impacting a large portion of the procedures, at least in the short term. It doesn't include Medicare Advantage, it doesn't include Medicaid, it doesn't include commercial payers, it doesn't include the hospitals that were already signed up for the BPCI program.", "So it's obviously certain MSAs that are required to participate, but it's very small and there aren't any penalties in the short term. So I wouldn't get overly concerned about this. It's not a new thing. Bundled payments have been around for a while. They are not brand-new. It's now mandatory in certain MSAs, but I don't really see that as a catalyst to changing behavior in any meaningful way, at least not in the short term.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Okay. And just to follow-up on that, Kevin, was there any slowdown potentially on the MAKO system side that was I think down year over year, just in anticipation of CJR? Hospitals trying to figure out how that program is going to play out. Maybe some of those facilities deciding just to pause on it?", "Kevin Lobo", "No, I would say no. I think our order book is really strong for robot sales and our procedure growth was very robust, both in UKnees and in hips. And that's not new, the hip procedure growth was very strong in the back half of last year. So no, I would not say that there was some kind of change in behavior. We're really seeing continued growth and I am very bullish on our MAKO business.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Okay. And then as my follow-up, just on the domestic performance again, this quarter was extremely strong. I am just wondering with Q1 typically being a seasonally soft quarter and the strength that we're seeing here, obviously comping on ACA, it just seems interesting to me how strong everything has been.", "Can you just talk about volume price, mix, share taking, what's driving all that strength domestically? And then should we think about things in the U.S. slowing down in the back half, with OU.S. picking up and then exiting into 2017 hopefully with both of those segments starting to realize more normalized type growth?", "Kevin Lobo", "I think we're going to continue to see strong performance in the U.S. Obviously, this was a very big quarter, but the real genesis of this is fantastic product pipelines. We have across our businesses, very, very good condition of our pipeline with many new launches that are just starting, launches that started in middle of last year.", "So having healthy product pipeline is always great and that leverages our best asset which is our sales forces of Stryker which really know how to execute. And we have health across our divisions. And that wasn't the case a few years ago. We had a few divisions that were a little bit softer. We now have strength in our endoscopy with our new camera. We have strength within our neuro-powered instruments. We have the human stroke market taking off, we have a strong pipeline within spine. You are seeing the 3D-printed implants taking off. So really across our portfolio, we have very strong pipelines.", "So that isn't a one quarter thing. I think we will continue to see strong performance through the course of the year. And we continue to spend very robustly in R&D, so we have a cadence of new products that will continue. And so I really believe this is sustainable. We will continue to perform very well in the U.S. It's not a one quarter thing.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Company. You may proceed.", "Mike Matson", "I guess, Katherine, I just wanted to ask about the Sage and Physio-Control acquisitions. Should we expect the growth rates to continue this year at the historical levels, so sort of double-digits at Sage and mid-single digits at Physio-Control? Or is there a risk that the growth tapers off a little bit while you are integrating those companies?", "Katherine Owen", "Recognizing there's always integration that has to happen, so I don't want my comments to be construed as exact targets for every quarter. But overall, Sage has a long history of sustaining very strong double-digit growth. And our goal, as I mentioned, is to make sure we do everything to continue to support them and over time unlock more of the opportunity outside the U.S. Physio-Control is embarking this year on a hefty new product launch cycle that will go for the next two years.", "So I think your estimations are a good place to be thinking about and again, we will be very transparent. We're going to give pro forma revenue performance for each business, respectively, for the first 12 months. So you will be able to see very clearly how they are growing relative to the prior-year base.", "Mike Matson", "And then just with regard to the emerging markets and I guess China more specifically, can you just talk about the differences in what you're seeing with regard to the implant markets and the procedurally driven products versus the capital equipment markets? Do you have any sense as to whether or not the actual end markets for procedure volumes have slowed down? Or is that just steady and there's just some destocking going on at the distributors?", "Kevin Lobo", "So I break it into three categories. I would say that the slowest impact and the greatest negative impact to us has been in the capital equipment. Then next would be spine and trauma which is -- a lot of that is tendered type of business where we've seen the distributors really had loaded up and are bleeding their inventory. And then the least negatively impacted would be in the hip and knee category which has a lot more cash pay and so the cash pay market is the least impacted. So I put it in those three buckets and obviously, it's all negative with varying degrees. With capital being the most negative, spine trauma second and then hips and knees last.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.", "Larry Biegelsen", "First, I wanted to ask about trauma and extremities and then I had one on M&A. So Kevin, trauma and extremities has obviously been a stellar performer for you guys for a long time, but the two growth areas that you are not participating in are relatively small and are shoulder and cervical disc. So could you give us an update? I know you launched your shoulders a year or two ago. Give us an update there on what you're seeing and the outlook. And then second, how attractive is the cervical disc market to you and how important is it to have a cervical disc market? And I had one follow-up.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. So shoulder, you are right. We're a relatively small player, but we're very pleased with the launch of our primary shoulder and our reverse shoulder which we launched just over a year ago. That has very nice growth, albeit from a small base, so we really believe we have the right products to be able to win in the market. It's going to take time. This isn't like foot and ankle, where we're approaching new surgeons.", "We have to be able to take share. But I was very encouraged by the growth the last two quarters in our shoulder business. It doesn't really make a big impact in our overall business, just given the size, but I feel that we now have a very good portfolio and shoulder will become a growth area for us going forward. What is the second question?", "Larry Biegelsen", "On cervical disc, how important it is to have a cervical disc.", "Kevin Lobo", "We would normally report that if we had a cervical disc which we don't right now. That would be reported in our spine business, not in our trauma and extremities business. And right now, our spine business is doing really well. We're launching many, many products. We don't feel that we have to have a cervical disc at the moment to be able to drive growth. It's something we will look at, but at the current time, we don't see that as an impediment to having strong growth in our spine business.", "Larry Biegelsen", "And my apology for wrapping that into trauma and extremities, sorry about that. So Kevin, you spent $4 billion on two recent deals. So my question is how does that impact your ability or willingness to do more deals right until you integrate those two? Thanks for taking the questions.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. We still have significant capacity to do extra deals. So we had a one-notch downgrade from both S&P and Moody's and if you look at S&P, we went from an A plus to A rating. We're committed to maintaining investment grade, but there's obviously a large gap between A rating and the low end of investment grade. Keep in mind that the vast majority of the deals we do are small tuck-in deals. That will continue to be the case for Stryker. That is where we drive the most value and we find great technologies that we can give to our fabulous sales forces to drive.", "So you will continue to see -- those will be the majority of deals, but we still have significant capacity to do more M&A and I would say all of our businesses have embedded BD people. We have not told them to slow down at all, so they are continuing to scour the market to look for opportunities that will add value. And we won't hesitate to pull the trigger on new deals if we believe they will be value-creating for Stryker.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.", "Matt Keeler", "I guess just to start on Sage, you highlighted the potential to build that in Western Europe. And I was wondering if you could help us think about that market opportunity. Is that a market similar in size in Western Europe to the U.S. and Sage just has a smaller market share or is that a market that you will be building from scratch?", "Katherine Owen", "This will be much more building the market, much the way Sage did in the U.S. They really were -- is a driving force behind the innovations that allowed solutions to many of these hospital-acquired infections. These very elegant, easy-to-use solutions with demonstrated clinical data that shows when they are routinely used and they can significantly limit the occurrence -- the same conditions, hospital-acquired pneumonia infections, are prevalent around the world. It just was not an area they focused on, given their initial investment in the U.S. market.", "So this will be market development. It will be using the sales force as they do to help drive that, but it's -- very much the same conditions exist, but it will be much more about market expansion which is why we say over time, this is the value we look to unlock and it's not something that's going to occur suddenly in 2016. This will be a multiyear process to really start to drive awareness and adoption.", "Matt Keeler", "And my follow-up, last quarter, you shared some margin targets for the year. Just wondering if you will give us an update on what those will look like with Sage and Physio-Control.", "Katherine Owen", "So we provide top-line and earnings guidance. We don't provide specific margin guidance, although as Glenn noted on the call, while the magnitude of the year-over-year increase in gross margin won't continue, we should continue to be at the Q1 levels for 2016. But we haven't given specific guidance. We do expect margin expansion that is inclusive of the deals as they closed in early April, but beyond that and the -- upward to the targets today, there is nothing additional.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.", "Glenn Novarro", "Two questions, one, U.S. knees and hips for Stryker came in better. Yesterday, J&J also reported a much stronger U.S. and knee/hip number. So the market is likely coming in better. But Kevin, I just wanted to see what your view is on the competitive dynamics. Zimmer and Biomet sales forces have combined as of last year. But I'm just wondering, are you still possibly seeing disruption in the marketplace associated with Zimmer and Biomet? And could that be helping your results as well as J&J's results yesterday? Then I have a follow-up.", "Katherine Owen", "So we're really pleased with our result, particularly our U.S. performance, in both hips and knees. At this point, with the largest player having not yet reported along with other competitors in the market, it's very difficult to make any kind of call with conviction around market growth. So clearly, we will have a much better sense as additional numbers roll in where the overall market growth is, but we feel very comfortable in the U.S. that we grew at the high end, if not above the market, but we will have to wait to see how numbers come in to get a general sense of whether there's been any type of acceleration. Keep in mind in recon, you really have to look at rolling four quarter trends because growth rates can vary quarter to quarter. So I wouldn't want to read too much into an uptick in growth to the degree we see one in the first quarter, because it may not be indicative of a trend line.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay. And then one last follow-up on CJR, one, of the pushback that we get is there is a thought out there that surgeons will start cherry-picking patients, that they may not do the more challenging cases and then they may fall through the system. Our due diligence does not suggest that will happen, but I just wanted to hear your opinion.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, this is obviously gotten a lot of focus of late. I would tell you we do not believe that CMS's intent is to reduce utilization. It's really rather to ensure that each patient has access to their most appropriate care. There has been the speculation, but of some type of step-function reduction in volumes as higher-risk patients are increasingly denied surgeries. We believe that it's unlikely. We do think based on all the work we've done through SPS and obviously our presence in recon that surgeons are going to continue to look to optimize treatment for higher-risk patients. They do that today and this will include managing their post-acute care which can vary.", "So they have and are going to continue to treat all types of patients. The data clearly shows hip and knee surgery has a very high long term success rate and significantly improves quality of life. And that's for all patients, not just the healthiest ones. So we're not expecting some type of significant change, but rather we do believe they are going to look to find the optimum ways to treat these patients, including the post-acute care regimen.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. You may proceed.", "Kaila Krum", "So a follow-up on Rich's earlier question on spine. Just to dig in a bit further, you mentioned that you are seeing an increase in volume. Can you give us a sense for where you believe that increase in volume is coming from? Is it more market-related or do you think that you are taking share? And if it is the latter, I'm curious as to whether or not that share taking is coming from the bigger players in that segment or from some of the smaller pure plays.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, we think overall, the market might be modestly improving. But again, it is very difficult today because we're one of the earlier companies to report results. So we will have to see how all the numbers come in and it is also is going to vary by company which segment of the market more of your products are weighted towards. So overall, we've been launching a number of new products, we've talked about the investments we've made over the last couple years in the R&D pipeline and we think this is mostly indicative of us gaining more market share back.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, we've seen in the spine market, whether it is small players or larger players, innovation drives growth. And innovation is what takes market share. And our innovation engine is alive and well in our spine business and that's what's caused us to grow above the market.", "Kaila Krum", "Okay. And then I'm just curious if you guys had any differences in terms of selling days in the quarter that may have impacted growth in the quarter? And if so, that estimated impact. Thank you.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes, no. Selling days are equal between last year and this year.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.", "Kyle Rose", "Just had one question on MAKO, you've talked a lot about refining the processes in the workflow over the course of 2016 to prepare for the launch in 2017. When you think about that, how do you think about the optimal time of a procedure and the trade-off of being potentially time additive? And I guess the real question is when you come to market with the MAKO Total Knee, what percentage of that market from a volume basis do you think the system will be time neutral to your high-volume or to your medium-volume search? What is the real market segment that the MAKO is really targeting here?", "Katherine Owen", "Sure. So much of the data you are looking for, we're going to be able to track once we go into full commercial launch. And it is going to vary by surgeon. A really high-volume surgeon doing hundreds of knee replacements a year is going to -- this is going to be time additive. For the lower-volume surgeon, they are going to get much closer to time neutral. But it's also why we wanted to spend our time on the training protocol to really look at ways that we can optimize this with this first-generation product. The other key is this is not just about time.", "We believe we're going to truly improve the patient experience. We're going to have a more reproducible surgery, because there tends to be tremendous variation, particularly with lower-volume surgeons. We think we can improve muscle disruption and things that add to the fact that close to 30% of knee patients are dissatisfied with the procedure. So it's really not just about time, it is truly about having an experience that is better for the surgeon, better for the patient and over time, we believe the outcomes data will support that.", "Kyle Rose", "And then just another question on the robotic side, we've heard a lot of thoughts and rumblings about robotics in the spine market. In particular, more of a play on navigated pedicle screw placement. Just your general thoughts on that, given your overlap in the spine, as well as presence from a capital equipment side and navigation and then how does, if any is the MAKO -- your robot play a factor in those plans moving forward.", "Kevin Lobo", "So certainly, we have a terrific navigation business unit. That is within our instruments business and so we're very well aware of how that procedure gets done, whether it's with navigation or not. That continues to be a growth area for us, both the neuro and spine market. But we're in the next few years really focused on hip and knees with MAKO. We have a lot of work to do to get the Total Knee.", "We think that is a killer procedure. I think if you look down the road, five-plus years, certainly spine could be an area of interest. Hip arthroscopy could be an area of interest. Shoulder could be an area of interest. So there are many areas -- I think robotics will be a growth area for many, many years to come. But first things first, we really have to focus on hips and knees and that's where our attention will be for the next few years.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. You may proceed.", "Amit Hazan", "Maybe just start on hip and knee side, U.S. volumes. I want to maybe take a big picture market view for a moment. When we look and analyze the market models, some of your competitors' data, it seems pretty clear that hip width and volumes have been really strong for a couple years now, maybe up in the 6%, 7%, 8% range for the market as a whole in the U.S. That would be well above the 10-year plus average for volumes. So I'm wondering what you think has been the driver of that over these last couple years. And perhaps more importantly, the extent to which you think that is sustainable on the volume side.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, no, we're seeing a very stable market. Just look at demographics, every day in the 10,000 people over 65, more and more people are talking to friends that have had hip and knee replacement. The results are fabulous. People want to be active. So actually, we're seeing a lot -- certainly we see this with the UKnee with MAKO. We see a lot of young people going in for surgery, that wasn't happening before. You are seeing unemployment is a great proxy. When we see unemployment come down, we tend to see a lot more joint replacement, specifically knees.", "So hips really hurt, even when you lie down at night. Knees, you can defer and so we see that as a very good proxy. That is much more of a proxy than anything to do with ACA. So we really believe we've got a stable market that will continue to be stable for not just the next quarter, but for the next year or two years. And demographics is a key part, patient awareness is a key part and people wanting to be active. A lot of people want to be active and so we don't really see -- from a demand or volume standpoint, we don't see any headwinds right now. And frankly, the lower unemployment is a little bit of tailwind.", "Amit Hazan", "And then kind of back to MAKO and bundled payments, maybe just kind of asking a question in a different way to throw it out to you guys. What is the sales pitch for MAKO in a bundled payment environment? Essentially, how does MAKO fit into a 90-day [indiscernible] care better -- in a better way than what's being done here traditionally, such that it would have added value to the hospital?", "Kevin Lobo", "So we really believe MAKO is going to improve outcomes. If you have consistent, reproducible product placement, less soft tissue damage, you need less rehab for your patient, they are more satisfied -- that's going to win in the market. So it's irrespective of the type of payment, whether it's a single-payer system, like in France, a two-tier system like in the UK or whether we're now -- it's a bundled payment system.", "So the method of payment is less interesting to us, frankly. If we deliver value and prove that value, we will win in the marketplace. And frankly, when you look at a bundle, again, the implant price and even with the robot, if you factor in the robot. And that is still not the majority of the procedure cost. So there's a lot of room to optimize beyond just the implant and we really believe if we deliver that excellent experience and they have better outcomes that we will be able to win in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Jeff Johnson with Robert W Baird. You may proceed.", "Jeff Johnson", "Katherine, now that we're into April, on the MHLW price reset, can you just confirm now it's probably going to be, what, no more than 20 basis points, 25 basis point impact to your Company-wide pricing?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, that's a good approximation.", "Jeff Johnson", "And then Kevin, I guess a question for you. I heard the comments on the ankle performance in the quarter. It sounds like that was strong. When ITPS proposals came out the other night, the question -- I hadn't really thought of it until just staring at some of the rates the other night. But with us not getting a carveout on a total ankle replacement code which I don't think anybody really expected that we would again this year.", "But as you look at the episode of care cost on ankles being higher than hips and knees, but being reimbursed at those same rates and as we go into this bundled payment environment, you think there's any bias or any kind of skew away from ankles that hospitals would maybe take, just as their costs are higher, but reimbursement is the same with -- being paid under those hip and knee codes?", "Kevin Lobo", "So first of all, we're just starting with hip and knee in bundled payments. And I think Medicare is going to be looking at high-volume procedures and moving them into the bundle. Total ankle is a very small part of the total market. Fusion is still the standard of care. Ankles are growing very fast, but from a very small base. So I really don't see this hitting the radar screen, at least not for few years for Medicaid. They've got a lot of other procedures they are going to focus on. I do believe bundled care and bundled payments will increase. It's a good thing for the overall healthcare system, it will address a lot of costs that need to be reduced.", "Frankly, in the case of hip and knee procedure, there is an over-prescription today on the post-acute. There's a lot of costs and we've seen when we work with hospitals on their service line profitability, that is the area that we tend to focus on the most. So I think we're a long way away from bundled payments having a big impact on total ankle. And frankly, it's a better outcome. So fusion is -- was standard of care in some of the joint replacements a long time ago and that's been replaced by total prosthesis and total ankle will be a better outcome. Of course, like everything in healthcare, finding payments and getting procedures reimbursed always goes through its ups and downs, but if you have a better outcome, eventually, it will get paid. So I don't really see a headwind for that, at least not in the next few years.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.", "Josh Jennings", "I just was hoping you could clarify -- it looks like there is a step-up in CapEx in Q1 from the normal run rate. And just the driver behind that. And just linked to that question is any major product launches across the major divisions that you would call out that are going to help with this 5.5% to 6.5% organic growth trajectory? Thanks a lot.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes, in Q1, we started some of the spending that is going to be required for our deployment of our new ERP system. And so that is the big thing that kind of stuck out in the cash flow.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. And as it relates to product launches -- so we have a number of products that we've talked about, like the signature line of neuro-powered drills that haven't had a full-year impact. But we do have our -- a Neptune 3 launch that is upcoming which is the main waste management product within instruments. That is coming in the middle of the year. That will be a contributor to growth, but I would say it's just a continuation. The camera launch was December. It really was mid-December of last year, the 1588.", "We're getting great customer feedback, so that will continue going into this year. Sports medicine is launching a number of products. Spine -- the 3D-printed implant -- the interbody device, great feedback, but a very small number of surgeons put those in in the first quarter. So we will expand that launch over the course of the year. So I wouldn't point to one single product. It is just typical of Stryker. We tend to have our growth spread across a wide variety of products, but there are a number of products that will contribute to the growth rate. And obviously raising after one quarter, we have confidence that we will be able to sustain this level of growth.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the second quarter 2016 results will be held on July 21. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Andrea and I will be your operator for today's call. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker CFO; Tim Scannell, Group President, MedSurg and Neurotechnology; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today's call I will provide opening comments, followed by Tim with an update on our two recent acquisitions, Sage and Physio-Control. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.", "With Q2 organic sales growth of 6.6%, we continue to demonstrate the strength of Stryker's diversified revenue base, which is allowing us to consistently deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech. This quarter, our growth was powered by robust performance in MedSurg and Neurotechnology, while Orthopaedics was in line. Our decentralized business model is enabling us to drive innovation and strong sales and marketing execution.", "On a geographic basis, organic growth was led by US, up 9%, while sales outside the US were up 2%, which is continuing to be impacted by ongoing challenges in China. Beyond the top line achievement, Q2 was highlighted by strong operational expense leverage that reflects our focus on driving cost transformation across divisions and geographies. As previously mentioned, we have a significant opportunity to deliver greater SG&A leverage on a multiyear basis with initiatives such as indirect spending, product life cycle management, and the optimization of our IT systems.", "As we are starting to see the impact from these initiatives, it underscores our conviction of delivering leveraged earning gains. Based on our first half performance, we now look for full year organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% and adjusted per share earnings of $5.70 to $5.80 a share. I will now turn the call over to Tim.", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "Thanks, Kevin. Good afternoon. I'm excited about participating in today's call and providing you with perspectives regarding our recent acquisitions of Sage Products and Physio-Control. I will begin with Sage Products and reiterate the strategic rationale which drove this acquisition.", "As we articulated in February, Sage complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative ICU and MedSurg products with disposables targeted at reducing never events. It also provides access to an important adjacent market that expands our hospital product offerings and improves our mix of single use versus capital products.", "Sage's approach to innovation focuses on demonstrating superior clinical outcomes which underscore the benefits of their products, driving customer adoption and loyalty. These innovation efforts have resulted in unique and highly trusted brands, which are an essential part of nurses' daily interactions with patients in hospital ICUs and med-surg units. Sage is number one in all the segments it serves, and we believe that in North America alone, Sage's products address a segment totaling approximately $1.4 billion.", "Turning to the financials for Sage, given that we closed the transaction on April 1, we are able to share a full quarter of sales results. Sage's performance was strong in Q2, with sales growth of roughly 9%. This performance was achieved while contending with an unexpected supply interruption during the quarter that was one-time in nature and has been resolved. Without the supply interruption, Sage's growth in Q2 would have been approximately 14%.", "Sage's success has been fueled by their commitment to innovation, which has resulted in the long history of successful new product introductions, including the recently launched AirTAP product. Using proprietary air-assisted technology, AirTAP enables caregivers to provide exceptional care by aiding in the turning and boosting of patients while the patients remain in bed. AirTAP enhances caregiver safety as it requires 80% less force to boost patients, versus a typically used draw sheet.", "With respect to integration, plans are underway to expand our manufacturing capacity beginning in 2018 to support expected growth. Moreover, our businesses are working to coordinate activities to accelerate revenue in areas such as key account and brand strategies. Our international focus will begin with Europe, where Sage has experienced some initial success in Canada, where they have done very well. Beyond these markets, we are working to prioritize countries which value proven clinical solutions that eliminate never events. We are excited by the cultural similarities and positive chemistry between Stryker and Sage, and expect double digit revenue growth in the second half.", "Turning to Physio-Control, I would like to also reinforce the strategic rationale that led us to acquire this company. As we described in mid February, Physio-Control complements Stryker Medical's portfolio of innovative and differentiated pre-hospital and hospital products, as Physio-Control is the leader in the development, manufacture and sale of defibrillators and monitors, AEDs, and CPR-assist devices.", "We are excited by the synergistic benefits and market strength that resulted from the combination of Physio-Control with our medical division. Importantly, the vast majority of Physio-Control sales call points overlap with our medical division call points. Physio-Control holds the number one or number two share position at every major segment it serves. We believe that on a global basis, Physio-Control's products address segments totaling approximately $1.7 billion.", "With Stryker's market leading powered cot and power load lift system coupled with Physio-Control's suite of defibrillators, monitors, and related products, our solution set is extensive. Our existing EMS franchises enjoyed tremendous success in recent years, with growth significantly higher than the market and Stryker as a whole. Physio-Control's business has an attractive mix of 60% capital and 40% recurring business, compared to our EMS business which is nearly 100% capital.", "In addition, Physio-Control has an impressive enduring competency in a robust pipeline of products that have recently begun to launch, with additional product launches slated for the next several years. We expect this refreshed product portfolio and the combination of our organizations to result in continued strong sales momentum and greater profitability leverage in the future.", "As a reminder, we closed the Physio transaction on April 5. Pro forma Q2 sales grew roughly 9%. On the integration front, our teams are focused on determining the optimal organizational design that best serves our common EMS and hospital customers. In addition, Physio has a significant international structure, and our medical division is assessing opportunities to drive growth by leveraging Physio's international market knowledge, strength, and operational infrastructure. We expect high single digit growth from the Physio-Control business in the second half.", "With these two acquisitions, the medical division is now bigger, stronger, better diversified geographically, and has more base business. Encouragingly, medical had a strong organic Q2 growth result while integrating these two acquisitions. This concludes my overview commentary on Sage and Physio-Control.", "Glenn will now discuss our Q2 financials in more detail.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Tim. I will focus my comments today on our financial results and key drivers of our second quarter performance. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today's press release. For the quarter, our organic sales growth of 6.6% exceeded the high end of the range of our full-year expectations despite a tough year-over-year comparison with growth of 6.9% in the year ago quarter. The quarter included one additional selling day compared to prior year and consistent with our previous communications, the additional selling day equates to approximately 1% of additional growth. Pricing in the quarter was down 1.3% from the prior year, trending modestly better than we expected.", "During the quarter, we continued to see strong US sales with organic growth of 8.6%, while international sales posted organic growth of 2%, reflecting continued destocking challenges in China. Our adjusted EPS of $1.39 increased 15.8% from the prior year, primarily driven by our strong top line growth, including the impact from the acquisitions completed in the quarter. Interest related to the recent bond offering unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.05 per share and foreign exchange unfavorably impacted EPS by $0.03 during the quarter.", "Looking at our segment highlights, Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%. The top line was led by US Orthopaedics gains of 5.9%, highlighted by a 9.5% increase in trauma and extremities and a 6.8% growth in knees, as momentum continued for our 3D printed Tritanium revision cones and our cementless knee products. US hips posted low single digit growth due to softness in the revision market.", "Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency growth of 2.9%, led by a strong performance in our European knee business. Lastly, we placed 17 MAKO units during the quarter. Overall, our second quarter results continue to reflect strong momentum across our Orthopaedics portfolio.", "Our MedSurg segment's constant currency growth was 34.2%, including the impact of the recent acquisitions of Sage and Physio. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our MedSurg business posted organic growth of 8.5%. Our US MedSurg business continued their strong momentum with organic growth of 11.1%. Instruments had solid US growth of 8% with strong performance in our power tools business, highlighted by double digit gains in our Micro Power tools. Endoscopy continued its momentum from Q1 with US growth of 10.8%, driven by continued success of our 1588 AIM video platform. Excluding the impact of the Sage and Physio acquisitions, Medical had US growth of 16.9%, driven by continued performance of its Power cot products as well as solid performance of our bed business.", "Internationally, MedSurg organic sales were down 0.5% for the quarter, reflecting ongoing challenges in China, primarily related to distributor destocking. We expect this to continue throughout 2016 as we work with our distributors to drive end customer demand and reduce the buildup in their inventories.", "Neurotechnology and spine posted constant currency growth of 9% and organic growth of 7.5% with continued strong momentum our neurotech businesses, which increased 14.4% while spine was up 1%. As with our other businesses, US neurotech growth was robust at 15.6%, which reflects the continued strong demand for our neurovascular products, the Trevo stent retriever and Target coil, our neuropowered instruments and our craniomaxillofacial fixation products.", "Our US spine business grew 4.8% despite experiencing product supply issues, but continues to see good demand for our newer 3D printed Tritanium products. We expect these supply issues to remain into the fourth quarter. Internationally, neurotech constant currency growth of 12.3% reflects the broader market momentum for the Trevo stent retriever and Target coil products. Spine's international growth was dampened by the aforementioned product supplies issues and continued challenges in China.", "Moving on to general operating highlights, our gross margin on an adjusted basis was roughly flat at 66.2%, down 180 basis points sequentially. We had another quarter of strong impact from our focus on operational efficiencies, including improved productivity and absorption. This was offset by the full impact of our recent acquisitions, including certain accounting reclassifications between gross margin and SG&A to align to Stryker policies, sales mix, and negative pricing.", "As for our operating expenses, we continue to focus on internal innovation with R&D spending of 6.4% of sales. On an adjusted basis, SG&A for the quarter was 34.9%, which was favorable by 120 basis points as compared to the prior year. The improvement reflects the favorable impact of SG&A leverage from our recent acquisitions, the previously mentioned reclassification of certain expenses, our sales mix, and continued focus on our operating expense improvements through our CTG program. For the quarter, acquisitions contributed roughly half of our SG&A improvement. Combined, these factors drove a 100 basis point year-over-year increase in our adjusted operating margin to 24.8%.", "Lastly, I will provide some highlights on our other income expenses. Other expenses increased due to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter. We anticipate that future quarterly interest expense will be roughly $30 million, which is consistent with this quarter. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 17.6% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure partially offset by the impact of higher US based income from our recent acquisitions.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.5 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 38% was held in the US. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter was $7.6 billion. Turning to cash flow, our year-to-date cash from operations was approximately $671 million. Finally, as we had previously announced at the end of Q1, we suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of the year.", "In terms of guidance, based on our second quarter performance, we expect our full year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% for 2016. If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate net sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% for 2016 with negative pricing being in the range of 1.5% to 2%. Lastly, our guidance for adjusted net earnings per diluted share in 2016 now stands in the range of $5.70 to $5.80 for the full year and we expect the third quarter to be in the range of $1.33 to $1.38.", "And now we'll open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Just want to get your thoughts on a couple of items. So number one, understand the guidance update for the year. One of the questions people are asking is just the third quarter is a little bit below where the Street was modeling, so I don't know if as you looked at Street models if there was anything in particular you thought the Street was off on relative to your expectations.", "And then second, the mix of growth was a little bit different this quarter if I look at Orthopaedics and MedSurg within those different businesses. Maybe there's a couple you want to comment on. There's a few that stick out to me, but I would just love to get your thoughts. Thanks.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. I'll take the first one. So as we look at Q3, seasonally Q3 is usually our softest quarter. I think if you look at our guidance, it's very consistent with our Q3 guidance that we've provided in the past, especially when you look at year-over-year growth.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And as to the second question, Mike, this is Kevin. I would say that from quarter to quarter you see this kind of change at Stryker, and we've seen this for the past few years where in the first quarter Orthopaedics had a more robust performance. This quarter was led by MedSurg. From quarter to quarter we see those variations. But what's encouraging to me is if you look at our growth versus the market, we continue to perform very well, especially if you look on a rolling four quarters basis.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And maybe just a couple more, Kevin, just to comment on. If I look at within different businesses, maybe some that were a bit surprising was maybe international spine, which you made some comments relative to the Orthopaedics business. There was some surprises like US hips was less than what we thought. Knees was pretty close. But there were some, relative to what we saw in the first quarter, there were some pretty good swings within the business model.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah so Mike, look, I'll just finish by saying in China we've had issues and challenges, and we've highlighted those in the past. That affected spine. That affected our endoscopy division. That affected our trauma division. Spine had some product supply issues which affected both our US spine business as well as our O-US spine business. And hips, as you pointed out, was a little softer this quarter, but we've led the market certainly in the US for multiple years in our hip business and it's just one quarter. So there's for me no concern there. We see these changes from quarter to quarter. And as you've seen, the resiliency of our top line quarter after quarter over the past three or four years has been very steady. So yes, there were a bit of swings this quarter, but nothing that causes me any reason for concern. We have very, very strong divisions across the company.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thanks and good afternoon.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Hi, Bob.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Bob.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Bob.", "Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So just a couple things to follow up on. One, just a little more color maybe on the US hips, recognize that you've been strong and it's just one quarter. But Kevin, you mentioned that you felt it was a soft revision market. So you feel like there was something going on with the revision market this quarter. So I was wondering if you could just give a little bit more color there.", "And also now that we're one quarter into CJR, maybe any thoughts from the field in terms of what you're seeing, client reaction, thoughts on how things are developing there. Thank you.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Hey, Bob, it's Katherine. Just a couple points. I wouldn't look at the quarter and say something particular was going on in revisions versus primary. Overall, it was a bit softer than we've seen. And much like the first quarter, it was a bit stronger than we typically see, but we're not hearing anything from the field, from our customers, that suggests something's changed. It really reinforces why you've heard us say over and over we're really focused on rolling four quarter trends, because we see this quarter to quarter variability, that taken as a whole when you look back, doesn't mean anything significant in terms of changes in underlying fundamentals. And we're not seeing anything different in this quarter other than it was obviously a weaker than normal versus Q1 being a stronger than normal quarter.", "In terms of CJR, as you know it went into effect April 1. We haven't seen any impact. I think it's simply too early. As you know there's no penalty until after the first full year. So it's just simply too early, but nothing has played out yet in terms of a significant change or impact on the market.", "Robert Adam Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then two other things I wanted to touch on. One was just maybe comment on gross margin. In Q1 we talked about thinking about 68% for the rest of the year and just would like to understand some of the moving parts that you were highlighting in the prepared comments.", "And then lastly as it relates to the deals, sounds like things are going well, Tim. Previously you guys had suggested that $0.15 to $0.18 of accretion in 2017 was a good preliminary estimate. I was wondering, from what you see today, is that still a good preliminary way of thinking about things? Or is that perhaps a conservative estimate? Thank you.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hey, Bob, this is Glenn. First of all, if you look at the sequential drop in margin Q1 to Q2, roughly 180 basis points, I mean Q2 was really impacted by mix especially, but not just sales mix but by adding in the acquisitions. It's early and our acquisitions are off to a solid start, but that's going to impact gross margin for the rest of the year, and it impacted more than just product. We made some reclassifications to harmonize Sage and Physio accounting practices with our accounting practices. And this essentially shifted some SG&A expenses up to gross margin in order to align them with how Stryker does the accounting. It's pretty common that we do that, and we don't get a chance to really see it until we really climb into the integration work. So that's one of the things that came out.", "And then on top of that, I really just need to reiterate that there's a lot of other things that make our margin move around. Not just price, but FX, geographic mix really impact it. And all of those are pretty hard to forecast to sort of a single point estimate. As I think about for the rest of the year and what you should maybe think about for your model, I think we'll be in the range of this 67% range, but understand that it could trend above or below that based on all those factors that I just mentioned.", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "And Bob, on the deals, this is Tim speaking. The accretion assumptions you cited look good. We're on track, and we would expect you could assume those to be good moving forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, just to I guess go back to Bob's question on the accretion from the deal. How should we just think about I guess that accretion? Should we think about that as flowing through? I realize it's still very early compared to, think about next year, but should we think about that baseline growth? I know we've talked about this in previous calls. Or should we think about that as still a little too soon to dial in accretion above what has been generally a double digit baseline growth for you?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Hey Kristen, I think it's very consistent with how we've messaged before. This is obviously going to be one of the variables that gets factored in as we go through our 2017 budgeting process. But clearly, it's incremental accretion above and beyond the normal earnings power of the businesses as they stand. How much of that flows through to the bottom line, how much of that we reinvest as we think about the opportunities in front of us, all of that will get factored in and will be evident when we give the range. So I wouldn't want to say it's a one for one, just throw it on all top of a normal earnings number because we have to look at the opportunities for reinvestment, recognizing obviously it's also incremental accretion and so some portion of it is likely to play out at the bottom line as well.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay, and then just generally on the market trends. I was curious from a competitive standpoint now that we've had a couple quarters on which I guess Zimmer is through with its integration of Biomet, and we've seen J&J come pick up its momentum within hips and knees. I was wondering if you guys could just comment broadly if you're seeing I guess what other companies are saying in terms of them getting their momentum back. Any particular changes that have been affecting you? And perhaps on the hip side, is this a reflection of some of the other companies getting their steam or is it just simply you feel just the revision market softening?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, I would say again it's just a quarter that was incrementally weaker versus quarters like the first quarter where it felt stronger, but we couldn't point to any discernible change or inflection point that suggested we had a new higher growth market. The only ones that reported are us and J&J so we have pretty limited visibility until everybody else reports, but we're not seeing or hearing anything that suggests that you're seeing some dramatic market share shifts. It's generally not how things play out in the recon market. So again, we're not seeing anything that would suggest that there's anything different than the normal quarterly variability that we see play out. Obviously it's more fun when it's Q1 and it's incrementally stronger. But again, that's why we focus on the rolling four quarters.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Just a few questions maybe starting with Kevin. Kevin, just with the extra selling day here in the second quarter, and thinking about the easier comps in the back half of the year, by our math, your guidance for the remainder of the year implies stable comp adjusted growth for the back half of the year. Is that just kind of roughly how you see the business stability on an underlying basis into the back half of the year? Or are there chances for acceleration or deceleration?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So David, since the beginning of the year, this is the second time we've moved our range upwards. And we've been delivering very strong growth throughout the year, yes. In China, and even all the emerging markets our comps will ease in the second half of the year, but we also have some challenging comps in some of our other businesses that were growing very robustly in the second half of the year. So it's a big business that we're managing, and I think if you're growing north of 6% organically while you're integrating acquisitions, I think you're doing pretty well.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. We would agree. Glenn, I think you've gotten questions on margins. But I think this particular quarter, it's sort of the mirror image of first quarter, where growth's a little weaker, SG&A control's a little better. I know you had some announcements on the ERP integration during the quarter. Can you just give us an update on where you are and sort of the ERP planning and what's the opportunity for savings for shareholders on the ERP, and when we may get an update on that number? And I have one quick follow-up.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, David, on ERP is one thing that we're focusing on relative to our CTG program. It has several facets. I would say we're in the pretty early stages of our ERP program. Obviously, when you're implementing a new commercial global footprint, it's a multiyear journey. And we're in the early stages of that. So we'll definitely keep you guys updated as that project moves forward. I think the more immediate term things to think about are indirect procurement and those parts of the project that really can have more of an impact as we roll forward in the next year.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, David, what we've been signaling on our cost transformation is this is really the engine of being able to sustain leveraged earnings year after year. And so in the earlier years, you are going to see more of that savings coming through from indirect procurement and in the later years you are going to see more of that saving coming from product life cycle management and coming from the ERP benefits. But I would say it's been a real rallying force for the company, to have everybody, all the different divisions of Stryker, working on a common system which is going very, very well. And it's a shift to SAP from a company that has really no SAP today. But I'm very encouraged with the early progress and I'm very optimistic about the implementation.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then Katherine, just one last quick one here. The neurotech number, obviously very, very strong and obviously the driver partially is the ischemic market. I feel like in the last couple of quarters, you and your competitors have shifted away, and they're much more focused on market development from here. I wonder if you could just share with us what specifically is Stryker doing on the market development front to drive that market. And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah David, we have been for some time been messaging around the market development. But with Tim here who runs that business, I'm going to pass it over to him.", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "Yeah, there was a variety of initiatives out there where we're simply partnering with systems, healthcare systems, hospitals, to drive patient flow to the right centers where they're performing these procedures. It will be a multiyear process and hospitals all vary in their level of maturity, but it's a very real and big challenge to get these patients to the right centers. But our efforts surround largely education, trying to assist, trying to ask the right questions, trying to connect people with the right consultants, things like that, and make sure their stroke centers are properly operating and they're getting the patients from the ER to the cath or the interventional lab to treat these patients. So it takes many forms. It takes many years, but I think what we're seeing is steady progress chipping away, but it's going to be years and years and years of efforts here.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.", "Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good evening, Kevin, and hello everybody. Maybe starting off with MAKO. In an oblique way you talked about you had solid US knee numbers. Where are you in the total knee rollout from MAKO? You didn't call out MAKO as a positive factor driving knee volumes in the US. Is it a factor? Just remind us where you are in those timelines with commercialization and papers and what's next for MAKO?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah thanks, Rick. This is Kevin. So, today MAKO is not a huge driver because we're really in the knee business, just using it for unicompartmental knees. We do have a limited launch, and the accent is the word limited. Just a small number of surgeons who are doing total knees. Early feedback has been very positive, so we're encouraged. But the reason for the limited launch is to make sure that we work out all the workflow and define training protocols and also be able to have some publications and podium presentations. The full launch in the total knee is not until next year.", "Rick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "So you know, maybe turning to Tim and Physio. Tim, you talked about high single digit second half growth for Physio, but you also underscored the pipeline and the products coming. Can you give us any more color on the pipeline? What do we expect? When do we see it? And does that accelerate or sustain that kind of high single digit growth pace for Physio? Thank you.", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "Rick, I would say it would sustain that high single digit growth rate. I think what I said after the deal was announced was that it would be accretive to Stryker's sales growth rate. And I would expect over the next several years to see next generation products in each of three main categories, defibrillators and monitors, AEDs or automated external defibrillators, and circulatory assist devices. This market is now turning into a PMA market in the United States, and so these launches will be global in nature and vary in timing by market. So we're not going to be overly specific about it, but I would say we expect, again over the next four to five years, to have a consistent stream of new products which would drive that accretive sales growth out of the Physio division versus Stryker.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks and congrats on the quarter. I had a couple questions on Sage. First, can you give us some more color on the supply disruption in the quarter, what happened there?", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "On the supply disruption, from time to time each of our businesses may have some issues. In this case it was one transient in nature. It's over and that's about as far as we're going to go in terms of sharing details.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. And then what's the timeline to build out Sage's presence internationally? You talked about a little bit in Europe and Canada initially. With the rest of the business, can you drop those products in your bag internationally and start to see some synergies in the next few quarters? Or is this going to be a protracted process where there are regulatory and tenders that have to go through before you really start to see that?", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "I think it will be a longer term process. As we've seen with all our international initiatives, it does take time. And so we do have a foothold in Europe and Canada as we talked about. Areas like Australia may be fertile ground but will take a while. Other areas like Japan will take even longer in terms of regulatory pathways. So we see great opportunity, but it's going to be a multiyear journey for sure.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just one quick one, if I could, on China. Do you guys have any visibility at this point where inventory levels stand and what your underlying growth in that market might be, excluding these drawdowns? Just to give us a sense of how close we might be to seeing a turn there.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so what we've been saying now for the past few quarters is we did expect this to be a very soft quarter in China, so it was in line with our expectations. We do expect sometime in the back half of the year that we'll start to reach bottom and that we'll return to growth. We don't have the precision, just based on having multiple tiers of distributors, we don't have precision to be able to identify that exactly, but you should see signs of improvement. Certainly while we exit the year and going into next year, we should bottom out sometime in the second half.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Keeler with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. First on the ex-US knee performance, you mentioned strength in Europe. Can you give us any more color around that? Was that market strength? Are you taking share?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "I think at this point it's just tough to know until everybody reports. We add up the numbers similarly and get a better sense of share shift at that point. So there's nothing specific that we would point to. We obviously have better execution now under our TOM model, which has helped a number of our businesses. But we'll know in a couple weeks if there's anything more beyond market growth versus share shift.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, it's important just to note that we have a few of our businesses that are really underrepresented in Europe, our endoscopy division, our instruments division, and knees, where the market shares that we have are certainly much lower than they are in other parts of the world. So when we produce a good growth number, it's really just sort of getting back towards what we would consider our fair share. And it's a very encouraging sign and we're pleased with some of the hiring that we've done in Europe and starting to build that business.", "Matt J. Keeler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, thanks. And then just a separate question on neurotech. Growth is very strong in the quarter but it slowed versus last quarter sequentially. Can you give us any color on the sub-segment growth rates in neurovascular and CMF and what drove that slowdown in growth?", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "There would be nothing I would point to. I think, as Katherine has talked about in some other areas, the growth rates can vary. It could be based on comps or different countries that did better or worse, or what have you. I think if we dug down into the numbers, CMF might be up a smidge and neurovascular down a little, but nothing that would point to any dramatic shift. I think in general we've had very, very strong performance and to me the good news is that that continues.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. It's important to know all three of those groups, so neurovascular is of course the biggest one, the neuro powered tools as well as CMF. They're all double digit growers. And so from quarter to quarter, as Tim mentioned, some are a little higher, some are a little lower. We had a 20% comp almost in the United States from the prior year and we continue to grow strong double digits on top of strong comps.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just with Tim in the room, I'd love to hear a little bit more about the MedSurg strength in the quarter. As you were integrating Sage and Physio, did you get any kind of benefit, either from a sentiment perspective from hospitals about adding those businesses? And then as we think about things going forward on an organic basis, now that you can bundle all of these things together, can you still deliver this mid or even upper single digit growth out of MedSurg going forward?", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "Well, to add a little bit of color, first I would say we're delighted with the performance of our medical division in the quarter, that they delivered strong core growth while dealing with the challenges of these two large integrations. Their EMS business did particularly well and they performed nicely in their core bed and stretcher business. Endoscopy is having an excellent year. Their core visualization business is performing exceptionally well with the 1588 camera. The communications business is doing well and the sports business is doing well there as well.", "I would point back to a couple deals we did in 2014, Berchtold and Pivot. These both are kind of in the mainstream now of being integrated and our team is fully in line with their products. So the Berchtold lights, booms and tables have sold well this year. The Pivot products have done very well in our hands as well. And over at Stryker Instruments, this has been a steady, strong performer over time. Their personal protection and fluid waste management businesses were real highlights in the quarter. We do expect a strong second half there as they'll be launching their Neptune 3 fluid waste management system in the coming days.", "So, I think across the board we were strong. I would also frankly note the sustainability business had a strong quarter and they've done well with recent product launches. And importantly, reprocessed products from Stryker have been embraced as a high quality solution by our hospital customers despite the fact that that's a challenging and difficult market. I would tell you no, there wasn't really any sentiment in favor of Stryker as a result of these deals, but importantly, we've had strong execution across the board, good new product flow, and we're optimistic about the rest of the year.", "Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Helpful. And then just shifting over to the trauma and extremities business. Still solid performance there, but on a two-year stack basis, that growth rate did decelerate here in Q2 versus the last few quarters. Is there anything going on there competitively of note that could prevent you from sustaining this share taking position you've been in for a while and getting, still outperforming the overall market growth rates, or should we expect more market growth rates from you from trauma and extremities?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Well we feel really pleased with the performance for both trauma and extremities businesses, but obviously the extremities base has gotten much bigger now. So you're looking at more challenging comparables that's still growing very solid double digits. And trauma we continue to see strong performance for that business as well. There hasn't been any meaningful change. We still feel good about the way those businesses are positioned. But obviously the law of large numbers sets in and the comps become more difficult. But beyond that, no. There's nothing we'd really point to.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Keep in mind, we did have a 18% comp in the United States in trauma. So we had a really huge growth in the prior year and still strong growth. We still believe this is going be a growth business for the company. So, and it's just one quarter. It did decelerate a little bit, but certainly a very impressive number nonetheless.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good evening everybody, and thank you. In looking at your spine business, that accelerated a little bit last year, it seemed through innovation and some better execution but slowed down a little bit this year, year to date. How are you thinking about that in terms of internal versus external development?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "You're right. We have invested a lot, in terms of the pipeline, in launching new products. As we mentioned, we did have some supply disruption that will continue into the second half here. As you know, we prioritize M&A across all the businesses, but we also invest in those businesses in order to be able to deliver results based on internal innovation and R&D. So don't think about that business any differently than other areas where we look at opportunities. As you know, we have BD people in all the divisions looking at targets, but also assessing that around opportunities to invest internally and grow the business organically.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would also, I'd just like to repeat what was mentioned earlier that we did have some product disruptions in the quarter in our spine business. The underlying business is in really solid shape. I feel great about the leadership team, the new products. We have some supply challenges and that will continue in the third quarter and then it'll start to improve in the fourth quarter.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Thank you. And then just to turn back to the gross margin moment, is there a way to peel this apart a little bit to understand the impact of some of the acquisitions or the recategorization may have had on that? Thank you.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I think if you think about the sequential change from Q1 to Q2, acquisitions in total were roughly sort of half of that change. And that should continue through the rest of the year in terms of the total growth, impact on the total gross margin.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Just keep in mind, when you get that hit at the gross margin, those are also lower SG&A businesses, so part of that big impact, the big SG&A decline as a percent of sales in the leverage is the flip side of that, where you're seeing the benefit both from a product mix as well as the reclassifications.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions on Ortho. First, Ortho pricing down 2.2% in 2Q, versus down 1.7% in 1Q. Is there anything unusual happening there, or is that just quarter to quarter fluctuations? And then on robotics, you sold 7 in 1Q, up to 17 in 2Q. Maybe talk about the momentum there with these outright sales and what's the pipeline looking like in terms of robotic deals in the back end of the year? Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yes. So to take the first question, no I wouldn't read anything into 1.7% versus 2.2%. It's within the normal variability that we have historically seen, much like total pricing trending less negative, but still within the range of that 1.5% to 2% that we think about. Yes, very pleased with the robot placement and the fact that we have the early observational studies underway in the limited launch. The order book looks strong. We're excited about the outlook there as we prepare, as we talked about, to going to full commercial launch in 2017.", "Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "And then quick follow-up for Glenn or for you Katherine. You had the extra selling day in 2Q. Is everything normal for 3Q and 4Q?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yes. So if you think about it, there was no difference in selling days in the first quarter, whether you look at it US, O-US, worldwide. Second quarter we had one extra selling day, which equates to 1% impact overall in our businesses. And then Q3, Q4, there's no difference in selling days US, O-US, or worldwide.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good afternoon. Couple questions if I could. So the spine product issue you had in the quarter, perhaps you could provide a little bit more about that. Was that related to the 3D products that you've rolled out or was that something different?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "No. We're not going to get into too many details just for competitive reasons. We do have a supply disruption issue and some supply challenges. We'll work through those in the third quarter. We did highlight the Tritanium product, and a lot of momentum around that, excited about what that product will do for that portfolio. But not going to go into additional details other than to say you should assume the impact lingers into the second half of this year.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. And then just for my second question, Medtronic obviously made some noise in June about coming into the orthopedic market. Curious if you've seen anything, one. And two, if you have any thoughts just around what Medtronic would mean for this market.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "No, we haven't seen any impact and they'd obviously be better positioned to talk about where they are in the launch or signing up customers. So today, no, we don't see any impact. Obviously we believe in the value of the rep and as well as innovation in this market and we're really going to focus on just that and the MAKO total knee launch, which we think has the opportunity to be truly disruptive in the reconstructive market.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mike Matson with Needham & Co. Your line is now open.", "Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess I just wanted to start with MAKO and thinking through the total knee full launch next year. I guess to what degree do you think the need to sell the very expensive capital equipment or the robots will limit the growth or limit the rate at which you can take market share in the knee market? And is there anything you can do to potentially speed up those placements in order to capture more of that knee implant share?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, so we're selling the $1 million robots right now. We did 17 this quarter, and that's before we've gone into full commercial launch for what we think is the biggest driver in value with the MAKO opportunity. And moreover, we've been selling very expensive capital in our MedSurg businesses for literally years and years. So we understand how to sell capital. It is fundamentally different than selling implants or disposable, which is why we have a separate dedicated salesforce.", "We also have for a number of years now had a flex financial group within the Stryker organization, and our MAKO group is using that to leverage their expertise to offer different options to our customers whether they want to buy outright or lease. And so that expertise that's been developed for a number of years through MedSurg is clearly enabling a different type of discussion with customers than was possible when MAKO was a standalone. So we feel really comfortable in our ability to sell capital and the value proposition that's driven by the different applications that will exist on the MAKO robot.", "Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC", "I guess what I was getting at is, if you came out with a new type of a knee implant, you could walk into an operating room and the doctor could switch to that new implant on day one, whereas if they're going to switch to MAKO, they've got to convince the hospital to buy a really expensive robot first. So that's going to kind of slow down the ability to take knee market share, is it not?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, to be able to do a robotic knee, you have to buy the robot and it will be a closed system and can only use our knee. So that's part of the value proposition. We go in and we have that discussion and articulate the benefits here. So this is very different than just simply coming out with a new knee and not having to buy capital. Yes, that's correct. But it's also very different in terms of the value that we think we'll bring forward and will start to get evidence of as we do these observational studies and look at benefits around less tissue disruption, improved alignment, a number of different factors that we think will help support the value proposition.", "Mike S. Matson - Needham & Co. LLC", "All right, thanks. And just if international growth were to improve, what would that do to your gross margin?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Generally international flows through gross margin at roughly the same rate that we're experience on an average here. It would roughly flow through at about the 67%. It really depends sort of where internationally, as well too, because certain emerging markets are better. European pricing impacts are usually higher. But up and down from the 67%, that's roughly a good ballpark estimate.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. Your line is now open.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One spine question and then one on the medical business. First, I mean, what are you seeing sort of in the spine market broadly from a competitive perspective? And really I'm curious about your thoughts on sort of that multiyear robotic movement that now several companies are talking about in that space specifically.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we really like that many companies are talking more and more about robotics. I think that provides a real good tailwind for MAKO. We believe we have certainly the best system with haptics and really terrific intellectual property. And so the more that robotics become a positive word out in the medical technology community with our customers, I think that provides a real good tailwind for us on MAKO. We're not seeing anything new in the spine market. It's a tough market with many competitors. We like our ability to win in the market based on the innovations that we've been bringing forward over the last two, three years. We did have our own challenges, as we've mentioned a couple of times on the call related to supply disruption, but nothing really new from a competitive standpoint.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on the recent acquisitions in the medical business. I mean, just looking at the pro forma growth rates you gave us in the quarter, understanding we're obviously early in the integration process, but with that in mind, I mean how do you expect those pro forma growth rates to trend in the coming quarters? I mean should we expect modest dislocation before an acceleration or just consistent growth with typical seasonality in Q3 and Q4?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I'd say, I guess my answer would be consistent growth in Q3 and 4 tied to that, those numbers we cited of high single digits and double digits.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. First, international. Kevin, I think you said last quarter emerging markets were down in the high single digits in the first quarter. Was it similar in Q2? And by our math, Europe was also a little soft in Q1. How was Europe in Q2 and what's the outlook there? And I did have one follow-up.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I'd say emerging markets, it was a very similar story in Q2 as it was in Q1. It was just as bad a quarter. As it relates to Europe, Europe had a mid single digit growth in the second quarter, so we were actually very pleased with the second quarter performance. There was a little bit of softness in the first quarter and it got back on track in the second quarter.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "That's helpful. And then for Tim on the ischemic stroke market, could you talk a little bit about how that market has been developing in 2016 versus a strong 2015? In terms of patient numbers treated in the US, it was probably up 30%, 40% from about 12,000 to 16,000, 17,000 last year. Is 2016 looking like as strong a year just from a ischemic treatment, endovascular treatment of ischemic stroke? Thanks a lot.", "Timothy J. Scannell - Group President, MedSurg & Neurotechnology", "Yeah, I think the growth trends have been similar this year to last year. And certainly further to this law of larger numbers and what have you, the growth rates arguably would diminish with time. But it continues to be a very robust market with very significant growth opportunities lying ahead of us.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Newitter with Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.", "Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. I have two. The first one, just to follow-up on the robotics question and the competitive landscape. Just specifically with respect to spine, can you talk to us a little bit about what your view is of spine robotics technologies in light of recent investments that others are making there? And then I'm more just thinking if and when you potentially adapt a MAKO solution to spine, what area or in what capacity do you think that could add value to the procedure? Then I have a follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, I think it's just early right now. There's been a lot announced, but there hasn't been a whole lot launched. And so I think we're just going to have to wait and see, and do they truly facilitate making the procedure easier or enhancing the outcomes. We do believe there's opportunity for robotics when we look at MAKO in spine, but it is not the focus right now. We are completely focused on the opportunity in recon, and particularly gearing up for the total knee launch. So it's certainly something that we're going to evaluate, but near term it is not the focus.", "Richard S. Newitter - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then just a second one, someone asked a question earlier about Medtronic getting into hips and knees eventually. I guess my question to you is Medtronic talked about a risk-sharing model. Can you talk a little bit about what, if anything, Stryker is thinking about doing and potentially going at risk with the hospital in an episode-of-care payment situation?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, we have done that. We've had our Stryker Performance Solution group within the company now for a number of years. They go at risk. We've got convener status. Under the prior program, we're able to share with customers. So this is something that through that SPS, we've got a lot of institutional knowledge. We obviously have a very deep understanding around the reconstructive procedure, what the value drivers are through the entire episode of care, both in the acute and the post-acute setting. So given our long history in ortho, we think we're well positioned on top of the expertise we developed over recent years through our Stryker Performance Solution to really go in and partner with customers, and sometimes go at risk and at others construct models that help them maximize the value chain.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We just haven't talked about it a lot since it's not an enormous part of our business, but we have the capability. We're already doing it and we certainly are having more and more conversations with customers as the CJR rolls into effect.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good evening. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. I just wanted to follow up on, Kevin, your comments on Europe and stronger growth in Q2 from Q1. And I think this is the second quarter post annualization of the Transatlantic Model Initiative. Are you beginning to see more benefits in Q2? And do you think we should, should we think about your European business continuing to potentially accelerate or at least continue to get, receive benefits from this Transatlantic model? I just wanted to see if there was an update there.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So first, rather than just focus on the first quarter, I think we had a very successful year last year in the first year of the Transatlantic model, but it wasn't across every business. And we still have a number of businesses that have good growth in front of them. I highlighted knees. I highlighted instruments, and even part of our endoscopy division still has significant growth. So to us, we look at Europe as being a growth market, just given our relatively lower market shares, and we see it as a growth market for the next several years. So regardless of what's going on with Brexit or anything else, our relative low market share creates a big opportunity and this model that we've implemented we feel is contributing to the growth that we're experiencing and will continue to deliver high growth or higher than we've experienced over the past decades in Europe. So it continues to be a growth market.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Great. And I just had one follow-up on, with pricing, in the press release you called out a 1.3% headwind in Q2. And I was hoping to just get your thoughts on what you're seeing in the market. I know there's a lot of different sub-segments within your business, but I guess from a high level, how should we be thinking about the sustainability? Is this a new level? Is there anything to call out in the quarter? And just what you're seeing out in the market from a pricing standpoint. Thanks a lot.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, if you look in the \u2013 we break out the pricing and it tends to be more negative in Ortho versus MedSurg, but there's been no real change. Yes, it's trending slightly better or slightly less bad at 1.3% versus the 1.5% to 2% range that we forecast. But we've also seen quarters not too far back where it trended a little bit worse and came in north of 2%. So it's within tens of basis points at the range we're targeting. And there's so many variables between mix, both product as well as geographic that play in there that I wouldn't view this as indicative of some new trend line. I think 1.5% to 2% is a good number to focus on.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan with Citi. Your line is now open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, this is Lee Preston (59:38) on for Amit. I wanted to touch on two things from mix. It seems like some of your competitors' data for product mix has been pretty much ceased to be a positive tailwind. It's pretty much flat now. I know you guys used to talk about it in that kind of positive 2% range, and it was offsetting price headwinds at about the same level. I realize you might not want to throw out a specific number, but directionally are we still in the same ballpark with the product mix that we had been in the past several years, around that positive 2%? And what are your thoughts on sustainability of positive product mix going forward? This is for hips and knees specifically.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Okay. So when we report price, and I know some companies do it one way, some companies do it the other, we report pure price and then the other number is volume and mix together. So price is negative, pure price negative, in Ortho, and it is offset obviously by volumes and to a lesser degree by mix. There hasn't been a big change in that in recent years, in terms of the overall impact of those items.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And then I have one follow-up. If you think about CJR next year, do you expect your mix of standard versus premium implants to change at all within your CJR customers for hips and knees?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "I think it's early. We'll see what happens next year when they start to go into the penalty phase. Again, we really believe based on all our research that the focus there is going to be much more in the post-acute setting since 50% to 60% of the costs lie there for the total procedure, and there's tremendous opportunity to take cost out when you look at the post-acute setting and the number of patients who get discharged to a rehab facility versus home care. That's where we think the biggest focus is going to be, because that's where the biggest dollars are.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Can you hear me okay?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes we can.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. I was wondering if you could just comment reflecting on the first half, just on utilization more broadly. Are you seeing anything different in the US market, it would be a little bit stronger than you would expect? Or you guys are seeing good execution and product updates (61:48)?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah, there's been no real change in utilization. Obviously hip utilization was a little bit lower in the US in the second quarter, but no, there has been no overall change in underlying demand across the businesses. It does vary bit to bit. Obviously the demand is going to be greater in something like ischemic. But no, there's been no fundamental change.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And once you get through the drawdowns in China, what kind of growth do you expect for your businesses in that market? Or what visibility do you have on the end markets there?", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "I think we'll have a better sense once we get through that. We're focused right now on really getting to the appropriate inventory level, and getting a much better sense of end user demand, because there is this distributor layer there. So it's difficult to predict right now. The comps get easier in the second half, but beyond that, we just don't have the visibility to say what true end market demand is going to be. As we start to get better visibility into the channel, we'll be able share that with you, but it would be premature to throw a number out.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And the area that's sort of the most hard to predict is capital equipment. I think on the disposables and the implants side of the business, we see that sort of, that's still, those markets are actually still fairly healthy and we expect that to continue going forward.", "Matthew Taylor - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Great. Thanks for squeezing us in. So I had one follow-up on orthopedic growth from Q1 to Q2. And I guess when we do the math on J&J's numbers, let's let you look at knees in the US, and adjust for selling days, adjust for price, it was a deceleration from Q1 to Q2. And you clearly, A, you've accelerated and B, you're also just growing at a higher rate. But I'm curious, is that feel in the marketplace to you like share gains in terms of accounts or mind share somehow? Or do you get the sense at all that there was, you know what the overall market was like? I know this is an (63:54). Just love to get what your perspective is on their deceleration and your sort of call it modest acceleration after adjusting for days.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so this is really our fourth really good performance in these, fourth quarter in a row of really strong performance. And we tend to attribute that much more to the launch of our cementless cones and the cementless knee business are really picking up. So our 3D printed products. We really believe that that's a big part of this and we also get a bit of a MAKO halo impact. So not specifically just the volume that's coming from our unis, but also wherever we put MAKOs, we tend to drive a higher mix of our business. So rather than comment on one particular competitor, I would just point out that our business has really picked up, and it's been multiple quarters now in a row of strong performance, really linked I believe to new products and the halo impact of MAKO.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And then just one follow-up, if I could. And I have a feeling the answer is going to be it's early around bundled payments. But speaking to folks in the field and working at some of these hospitals, either through BPCI or starting to consider how to tackle CJR, there is some thinking that there are centers that are just going to look at this and say we don't do enough of these procedures maybe to keep doing hips and knees, and maybe start shifting those procedures elsewhere in the network or upstream somehow. Again, I know it's early, but could you give some perspective on how you think that may play out in the market, because it's so much of the volume in orthopedics in the US is done by sort of lower volume centers.", "Katherine A. Owen - Vice President-Strategy & Investor Relations", "Yeah. It is early, so it's an accurate comment. Could we see in some hospitals a shift? It's possible. But I think it's too early to say that that's going to be a discernible enough trend or how it impacts the volumes of hospitals where it shifts to, to make any big comments on it. I'm sorry. We just don't have more insights yet given the early stage combined with the fact that there's no penalty in the first year.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the third quarter 2016 results will be held on October 27. Also, our analysts meeting and product fair will be held on November 9 at our Orthopaedics headquarters in Mahwah, New Jersey. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Amanda, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, all participants will have an opportunity to ask one question and one follow up question.

Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during the conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the Company\u2019s most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures.

You may proceed.", "Kevin Lobo", "Welcome to Stryker\u2019s fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker\u2019s CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations. For today\u2019s call, I will provide opening comments followed by Katherine with an update on MAKO. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before we open the call to Q&A.", "We achieved quarter\u2019s organic revenue growth of 6.7%, we delivered on our stated goal of achieving sales gains at the high-end of med tech. And despite tough year-over-year comparisons, Q4 represented our highest growth quarter, reflecting continued momentum throughout the year. Overall, it was another strong year for the company. We have shown remarkable consistency of top-line performance over the past four years. We continue to complete value creating acquisitions, our globalization efforts are bearing fruit, and we are also building capability to deliver consistent leveraged earnings.", "All of this is enabled by an outstanding team of high-performing leaders. Our sales growth was balanced across our three groups: orthopedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, once again underscoring the competitive strength of our diversified revenue model. On a geographic basis, the U.S. was up 6.3% organically while sales outside the U.S. posted a solid 7.7% increase, driven by another strong performance in Europe as well as year-over-year gains in emerging markets including China, which returned to growth due to soft comparisons.", "We would also note the performance of our acquisitions, particularly Sage and Physio, which posted adjusted growth in Q4 of 11.8% and 7.4% respectively. As a reminder, these two deals will begin to positively contribute to our organic growth in Q2 as they anniversary. With a strong top-line performance along with ongoing efforts around cost transformation for growth, adjusted per share earnings increased 14.1% to $1.78 a share, which represents the high-end of our $1.73 to $1.78 range. These results were achieved while maintaining a healthy investment in R&D to continue to drive future growth.", "As we look ahead to 2017, our sales and earnings targets reflect our continued commitment to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech and leveraged earnings. With the strength of our diversified model, our dedicated business units and sales teams coupled with our innovative product pipelines, we believe we are well positioned to deliver on these commitments.", "With that I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments on today\u2019s call will include an update on MAKO. We completed 2016 achieving continued success with MAKO as we installed a total of 32 robots globally of which 24 were in the U.S. For the full year MAKO installations totaled 86, an increase of 14 year-over-year, which brings a total number of robots globally to 381 with 333 in the U.S. During Q4, we expanded the limited market release to include additional sites, which will serve us training centers as we move towards full commercial release at the upcoming AAOS meeting.", "It\u2019s also important to note that in addition to installing new robots, during Q4 our MAKO capital specialists also begun upgrading existing robots, to enable the total knee application. This includes additional capital as well as software. Going forward our MAKO specialist will continue to focus on new robot installs as well as a multi-quarter process of upgrading existing robots.", "The revenue associated with the upgrade is included in other ortho revenue along with new robots, bone cement, and SPS related sales. Given the measured pace of the limited market release, we feel well-positioned to move into the full commercial launch, with a training protocol that will optimize outcomes for surgeons. We continue to focus on knee market share gains as the best barometer of the success of MAKO, and believe we will see evidence of its impact as we exit 2017.", "We look forward to the upcoming AAOS meeting, whereas you can imagine, MAKO will be the primary focus. We will host an investor event with members of our senior leadership team, along with a MAKO surgeon, to help answer your questions. We will also host a booth tour as we\u2019ve done in prior years, which will include a MAKO segment, along with other key new product launches. We hope you will be able to join us at the meeting.", "And with that I will now turn the call over to Glenn.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Thanks, Katherine. Today, I will focus my comments on our fourth quarter financial results and key performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today\u2019s press release. Our organic sales growth was 6.7% in the quarter with no difference in selling days. This was slightly above our full-year organic growth of 6.4%, which was at the high end of our latest outlook range of full year expectations of 6% to 6.5%.", "Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.5% from the prior year while foreign currency exchange had an unfavorable 0.6% impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. sales continue to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 6.3%, reflecting solid performances across our portfolio, especially in MedSurg and Neurotech. International sales grew 7.7% organically highlighted by gains in Europe, Canada and Australia and as we expected, a return to growth in China as prior year comparables eased.", "Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.78 increased 14.1% from the prior year reflecting strong sales growth accretive acquisitions and good operating expense control. Our fourth quarter EPS was negatively impacted $0.03, by foreign currency exchange.", "Focusing on our segment highlights for the quarter, Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 5.7% and organic growth of 5.3%, led by the U.S. with organic growth of 5.9%. These gains reflect continuing momentum in U.S. Trauma and Extremities at 8.4% and Knees at 5.7%. Underlying this growth is strong demand for our 3D printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio, and our MAKO platform, which installed an additional 32 units in the quarter including eight outside of the U.S. Orthopaedics International delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 3.9%, led by our European businesses.", "MedSurg posted strong gains across all businesses in the quarter, with constant currency growth of 32% and organic growth of 8.3%, which included a 7.4% increase in the U.S. Instruments, which grew U.S. sale 6% organically maintained good momentum with its waste management business and the newly launched Neptune 3.", "Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic growth of 5.9%, which underscores the strength of this product portfolio, including its video products, which includes the highly successful launch of the latest generation 1588 AIM camera generation platform, as well as communications, booms and lights products, and its sports medicine business.", "The Medical division had U.S. organic growth of 11.1%, driven by growth of its core bed, structure and power cot products. On a comparable basis, Medical\u2019s Physio business was up 7.4% and it\u2019s Sage business grew 11.8%. Both Sage and Physio continue to be accretive to Stryker, and our integration efforts are progressing as planned.", "In 2017, we continue to expect double-digit growth from Sage, and for Physio to be accretive to Stryker\u2019s growth rate. However, there will be pronounced seasonality with Physio, as they switch from a March 31 year end to Stryker\u2019s calendar year end, resulting in a soft first quarter, and stronger Q2 through Q4.", "Internationally MedSurg had constant currency growth of 29.4%, and organic sales growth rate of 11.4% which reflects strong European and Australian sales and some easing of the MedSurg comparables in China.", "Neurotechnology and Spine continues to drive above market performance with constant currency growth of 8.6% and organic growth of 6.7%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted growth of 11.4% in the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our neurovascular products, including our Target coils and AIS products, CMF products, and our neuro-powered instruments.", "Our spine business in the U.S. continued to see some supply issues, offset somewhat by strong demand for our IVS and 3D printed interbody Tritanium products. We expect these supply issues to continue into the first quarter of 2017.", "Internationally, neurotechnology and spine had constant currency and organic growth of 11.6%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia. Spine\u2019s International growth was also impacted by the aforementioned supply issues.", "Now I will focus on the operating highlights in the forth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3%, was down 90 basis points from prior year. Gross margin was favorably impacted by absorption and productivity gains, which was more than offset by unfavorable mix, including the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange.", "Our adjusted SG&A of 32.6% of sales was a 110 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. This improvement reflects favorable leverage from our continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program, cost containment efforts and business mix, including leverage from our recent acquisitions.", "Meanwhile we continue to invest in internal innovation with Q4 R&D totaling 6% of sales and full year totaling 6.3%. In total, adjusted Q4 operating expenses were 38.6% of sales which was 110 basis points favorable to the prior year quarter. These results continue to reflect our focus on leveraged growth.", "In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 27.7% of sales up 30 basis points from the prior year quarter. Our full year operating margin was up 60 basis points from prior year. This performance reflects the positive results from our various CTG programs, continued cost control, and favorable accretion from acquisitions offset by business mix, pricing and foreign exchange. We remain confident in our ability to deliver on our commitment of driving 30 to 50 basis points improvement in our operating margin annually.", "Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses increased due primarily to higher net interest expense related to increased borrowings at the end of the first quarter partially offset by the repayment of $750 million of debt in the third quarter.", "Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.7% reflects the benefits of our global tax structure, partially offset by the impact of higher U.S. based income from our recent acquisitions.", "Moving onto the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $3.4 billion of cash and marketable securities of which approximately 84% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the year was $6.9 billion.", "Turning to cash flow, our full year cash from operations was approximately $1.8 billion. Finally, while we previously announced that we have suspended our share repurchases for the remainder of 2016, we have lifted that suspension for 2017. We expect to repurchase approximately 250 million of shares, essentially, to offset the impact of dilution in 2017.", "And now I will provide our 2017 guidance. Based on our momentum from 2016, and our assessment of the current economic and market conditions, we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 5.5% to 6.5% for 2017. There is one less selling day in 2017, as compared to 2016.", "As you update your quarterly models, please note that Q1 has one more selling day, both Q2 and Q3 have one less selling day, and Q4 has the same number of days. Additionally, you should expect to see the relative proportion of earnings by quarter in 2017 to be similar to what you saw in 2016.", "If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be negatively impacted by approximately 1% in 2017. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1.5% to 2%, consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2016. In addition, we expect our CTG program and other cost containment measures to add 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2017. As required, we plan to adopt the new accounting guidance required by ASU 2016-09 on stock compensation. If our shares remain at the current levels and stock option exercises remain at historical levels, we expect the change in accounting for excess tax benefit to positively impact net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.7 to $0.9 in the full year, about half of which we expect in the first quarter.", "Including the impact of the aforementioned new guidance related to stock compensation, we expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate in 2017 will be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $450 million in 2017, as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure to support future growth. This level compares to $490 million of capital expenditures in 2016. Based on the current foreign currency exchange rates, we expect 2017 to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.10 to $0.12 per share for the full year, and approximately $0.02 to $0.04 per share in the first quarter.", "This negative impact is largely driven by the translational component of foreign currency exchange, which we do not hedge. The transactional impact of foreign currency exchange on earnings is mostly being offset by our hedging program, which we continue to layer in to our operations.", "Finally, for 2017 we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $6.35 to $6.45 for the full year, including approximately $1.40 to $1.45 in the first quarter. This guidance includes the aforementioned impact of FX, as well as accounting for stock compensation.", "And now I\u2019ll open up the call to Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. You may proceed.", "Mike Weinstein", "Thanks for taking the questions. Really, I think everything, as you\u2019ve laid it out in San Francisco, looks very consistent here. Kevin, just want to get your $0.02 on a couple of items. Number one, as you look at 2017, and you think about the potential for the MAKO momentum, benefiting at least your U.S. knee business and your capital sales and the orthopedic business, is there anything you see in 2017 that might not do as well? I would think the instruments business has a stronger year, and the spine business has the potential to recover. What\u2019s the offset that might keep you at the lower end of your 5.5% to 6.5% range? Obviously, we all see the potential for you to move to the higher end.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thanks Mike. Obviously you\u2019ve seen the last two years we have grown organic sales greater than 6%. We exited the year with very good momentum across our portfolio, except for spine. So spine had a tough year this year, issues will continue into the first quarter. We expect spine to improve starting on the second quarter. We also have tough comparables. You\u2019ve seen the type of growth we had in the fourth quarter, we grew 6.7% on top of the 6.4%.", "So tough comparisons and the unknown, right. So things can happen in the marketplace that you don\u2019t anticipate. And so that\u2019s why, I think bracketing 6% shows consistency, and we feel very good across our businesses. As the year unfolds, we\u2019ll see. MAKO is something we\u2019ve never done before. It\u2019s a very big launch. We were the fastest-growing knee in 2016 without a big impact from MAKO, but there\u2019s a lot of unknowns as we do this launch.", "So I think it\u2019s prudent to put the range in that, we\u2019re certainly leaning into start the year with 5.5% to 6.5%. It certainly a stronger position than we\u2019ve had the last few years.", "Mike Weinstein", "Just one follow-up, here. Are there any geographies in particular? You\u2019ve gotten through your tough comps, if you would, in China and Brazil. So, that obviously looks better going into 2017. Europe is coming off of a very strong 2016. Any geographies that you are concerned about, or you want to highlight?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, I think the macroeconomic uncertainty is the big in foreign currency right now. Obviously foreign currency doesn\u2019t impact our organic growth. But those are the two sort of things we worry about. Macroeconomics, there are elections that are going to be going on in Europe that could create uncertainty. Brazil seems to be getting, improving, but it\u2019s always so volatile.", "And China, we are not out of the woods, yet. Certainly, we have low comparisons, but we have a lot of work to do to improve our business in China. So I would say the areas of the world that concern us are the same that we\u2019ve had in the past, primarily related to emerging markets. And in Europe, there some macroeconomic uncertainty, with a number of elections happening in the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi, I just wanted to go through the guidance and make sure I\u2019m understanding this. The $3.65, the $6.45 does include the change in stock compensation, correct, of $0.07 to $0.09?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes that\u2019s correct.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay. And then how should we think about the incremental acquisition \u2013 accretion kind of falling through? Are you reinvesting all of that? Or, should we just think about the impact from the stock compensation is basically offsetting the larger headwind that you\u2019re expecting from FX this year?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes I think\u2026", "Kristen Stewart", "Or the benefit to reinvest the accretion from last year as you\u2019re talking about through 2016.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, first off on the accretion we still maintain that that will drop through based on the guidance we provided of $0.15 to $0.30 [ph]. As far as FX, right now given where currencies are, for the most part offset by stock compensation. But, I can\u2019t necessarily forecast where that will fall out for the whole year. Will continue to provide transparent guidance relative to translational risk on FX.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. You may proceed.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great. Thanks very much. Can you hear me, okay?", "Kevin Lobo", "We can Bob.", "Bob Hopkins", "Great. Good afternoon. So first question Kevin, is for you. I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more on the strength you are seeing in your growth rates outside the United States. I mean especially in hips and knees so maybe just some color on where is that coming from? Are you gaining share, is that market expansion? So just some color on the really strong U.S. growth we saw on fourth quarter. And then I have one follow-up.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. Thanks Bob. So we\u2019re really pleased with our performance in Europe this is the second year in a row that Europe is growing north of 6% and really very strong performance from our joint replacement business in Europe. Canada also had a very strong Q3, Q4. So as you know, we rolled Canada into our Transatlantic operating model at the beginning of 2016. And they had a very strong finish to the year. It took two quarters to sort of get Canada going but really had terrific performance and then I would say across the board we had good performance is in many of our regions. We have a significant MAKO presence already in Australia and we placed a number of machines outside the United States. And that\u2019s even if they are not yet doing total knees, it is a catalyst to provide growth. So really a strong performance but the countries that really stand out, I would say, would be Europe, for sure, where some recovery in China and Canada, as well those are the main markets.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay, great. And then for a follow-up, I want to ask you a question on kind of MAKO/capital spending environment. So on MAKO, if you could give us a little more color on maybe how that training is going? Any other metrics you are willing to share on training and how we should think about the rollout in 2017 in terms of placements? And then I was wondering, it\u2019s early, I realize. But are you seeing any signal at all from the market that hospitals might be more cautious in terms of spending on capital because of the political environment we are in and the risks around ACA? Are you seeing anything, at this point, on that front?", "Katherine Owen", "Hey Bob, it\u2019s Katherine. I will take that question and I\u2019ll start with the second part and a short answer is no, we haven\u2019t seen anything related to ACA concerns. You saw really strong growth in our medical organic business on top of the acquisitions as the strongest Q4 business. So right now, there\u2019s no evidence that there has been any impact and we feel good about the capital environment as well as our momentum in that market, overall.", "In terms of MAKO, we do think we are really well positioned since we did take a very deliberate, limited launch to really get the training protocol optimize. And as you heard at our analyst meeting, we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve seen so far. We\u2019ve continued to expand the training sites. We\u2019ve got roughly 50 surgeons trained. And it\u2019s important that they\u2019ve done sufficient volume because they\u2019ll serve is the training centers as we go into the full commercial launch, which we continue to target at the Academy meeting.", "So we\u2019ll continue to report on installs going forward, we just also highlighted though, that they\u2019re also going to be upgrading some of the fleet that\u2019s already out in the field. But again, we feel really well positioned and think as we look towards exiting 2017 we will start to see a clear indication that the total knee application is helping us drive meaningful share gains.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.", "David Lewis", "Thanks and good afternoon. Just a couple of quick ones, here. Maybe starting with you, I mean the top line guidance was better than we expected by at least 50 basis points. And I think about the bottom line, your currency was pretty in line. You\u2019re obviously better on the top line and you obviously had a couple more pennies on stock comp than we thought. Are there any select investments I appreciate your bracketing consensus. But there any select investments you are choosing to make here in early 2017? Which is why maybe some of the top line benefits not dropping through or it\u2019s just a conservative tacked on currency, perhaps, kind of early on in the year? It looks like the bottom could be a little better to us based on that very strong top line.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, David, I don\u2019t necessarily think there\u2019s anything that sort of warrants pointing out. I mean there are the obvious investments we talked about, especially our MAKO launch. But other than that, we are continuing to invest in our CTG program but that\u2019s really a continuation of things that we started last year and then we will continue to maintain sort of our kind of robust R&D spend as well, internally.", "David Lewis", "Okay. And then be just two quick product questions, maybe one for Kevin and one for Katherine. Katherine just on MAKO, this quarter MAKO system numbers in line with our number, probably a little below the streets and its all tied to that, de novo placement versus upgrade dynamic. Does that play out throughout the balance of the year, Katherine as we get to the second half of the year should we start seeing a greater reliance on de novo system placements versus upgrades?", "And then for Kevin, just neurovascular, that business sort of slowed a little bit and sort of the latter half of this year, obviously on very, very strong comps. You sort of talk about the outlook for neurovascular 2017, 2018 any key product launches we should be focused on that business which has been kind of a key growth driver. Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, David in terms of the MAKO, you were going to continue to install new robots and as I mentioned we\u2019ve got a lot of robots out in the field, a significant portion of which we expect to upgrade to the total knee over a multi quarter period. Exactly how that plays out, you were only a quarter into upgrading, I think we are going to just have to wait and see how that plays out over the course of the year but it will be a mix, obviously, if new robot placements with the same capital salesforce, MAKO capital specialists also doing the upgrades.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, as it relates to neurovascular, David, we still feel very bullish about the market you saw on Q3 both our results and the other major competitor, had a bit of a softer Q3 and then a nice bounce back in Q4. If you look at the full year, certainly in the U.S. our growth was 14.5% off a base of 15.6% the year before and so last year\u2019s fourth quarter was 16.7% this year\u2019s fourth quarter 12.8%, so you are talking about pretty good double-digit growth. There was one little blip and I think we are going to see that with the ischemic markets. So the ischemic market which is the very, very robust growing market. It\u2019s going to be a little choppy from quarter to quarter as new sites get established, new complete stroke centers get established. Getting that care pathway defined but we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects and I continue to expect double-digit growth we\u2019ve had since we\u2019ve acquired that business, every year, they had double-digit growth and we can expect that to continue in the future.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic from UBS. You may proceed.", "Matt Miksic", "Hi. Thanks for our question. So one follow-up on MAKO and then I had one kind of broader question for you, Kevin, if possible. And Katherine, to put \u2013 make sure we understand this process. It sounds like you\u2019re getting your training sites up to a level of volume where they\u2019re going to start doing more significant training. And that won\u2019t really happen until sort of the end of this quarter, just to put a finer point on it. Is that sort of when we expect training to really start kicking in?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. So when we say we go to full commercial launch at Academy that means we will have sufficient number of surgeons trained on sufficient volumes of procedures and located throughout various locations, geographically, that they can meet the demand for additional surgeon training going forward. That\u2019s exactly how you should think about it.", "Matt Miksic", "Okay. So then training starts kicking off. We got those folks trained and they try some cases and towards the end of the year we start hopefully seeing the result of all that.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. What we really try to underscore is that it is a measured launch. We have to continue to install new robots, they have to get trained, they have to go out and have their OR staff trained and start to do the procedure. It\u2019s not a light switch. It will continue to build throughout the year as we get more robots installed, more systems upgraded and continue with the training.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.", "Katherine Owen", "Sorry, operator. I think we cut off the prior caller. So if you could put him back in the call, I think he had a second question. Thanks.", "Operator", "One moment.", "Kevin Lobo", "I will put him back in the queue.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Katherine Owen", "Operator, maybe just go ahead with the next call and we will put him back in once he\u2019s redialed in.", "Kevin Lobo", "We got him.", "Operator", "Okay. Here we go.", "Matt Miksic", "Hi, can you hear me?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. Sorry about that Matt.", "Matt Miksic", "No, thanks so much for calling me back in. Sorry to hold up the show there. So Katherine, I was going to ask, just to make sure I don\u2019t get bumped off again, one just quick clarification. I did want to ask you a question Kevin. So the clarification just on the knee volume, you are seeing \u2013 you are taking share here right now today in the fourth quarter, the last couple quarters in knees. I\u2019m just wondering, putting MAKO aside, is there anything else that we can attribute that to, or what else do you think is driving that?", "Katherine Owen", "It isn\u2019t a huge impact other than what we\u2019ve talked about the halo effect from MAKO because obviously we don\u2019t have a lot of folks using the total application. But we\u2019ve also launched new products that have really helped on the knee side. We have our revision cones and sleeves which we introduced, those are 3D printed and they are really helping us gain share in the revision market for knees where we were below our rightful share, if you will. And we\u2019ve also launched some additional 3D printed products, or cementless 3D tibial baseplate \u2013", "Matt Miksic", "Right.", "Katherine Owen", "That\u2019s help driving a really meaningful shift and the percent of our knees that are done cementless now. So those are probably two couple of the products that we would highlight in addition to some of the MAKO effect that we get when we go into customers who are more open to hearing about our track online.", "Matt Miksic", "Great. Kevin?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes.", "Matt Miksic", "So the question I wanted to ask you is just one that we get a lot and think about a lot is sort of the range of scenarios that we\u2019re looking at here in the first half with actions coming out of DC. I\u2019d love to hear just if you are thinking about \u2013 you must be thinking about sort of planning around variability or uncertainties to way things could go and what could happen. I\u2019d love to think about how you are positioning the business or if you feel like you need to position the business for any variety of scenarios that might unfold, whether ACA or tax or anything else.", "Kevin Lobo", "Well, thanks for the question. I don\u2019t think this earnings call is going to be a great time to sort of go into this, Matt. I mean, there\u2019s so many different scenarios that we\u2019re looking at, whether it\u2019s around tax reform, whether it\u2019s around propeller replace. And all I can tell you is we do have a lot of those scenarios, but I think in the interest of time for this earnings call, I don\u2019t think this is really the best time to get into this because it will take me 10 minutes to kind of go through all of that.", "Matt Miksic", "Fair enough.", "Kevin Lobo", "I\u2019ll apologize in advance for that. And I think we will find another [indiscernible] where that would be a better place to go through those scenarios. But all in all, I can tell you we are not overly concerned. I mean, we feel that\u2019s a progral policies in general are probably a net positive for us. But there are a lot of other uncertainties that we\u2019ll have to see play out.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is coming from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.", "Glenn Novarro", "Hi. Good afternoon guys. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes.", "Glenn Novarro", "Great. Kevin, I wonder if you can just broadly comment on the knee and hip volumes in the U.S. in the fourth quarter. And the reason I\u2019m asking is, your numbers came in better than we expected, so did Zimmer, and J&J numbers too were fine. So I\u2019m just wondering, when we add up the fourth quarter, do you think there was like greater seasonality in the fourth quarter? In other words, this trend of patients holding off into the fourth quarter, was that greater than expected or some people have asked us, is there a possibility that we have seen a pull forward of procedures because individuals are worried about their insurance for 2017? I just wondered if you can comment on what I just said and may be any trends that you saw in the fourth quarter. I had a follow-up on the extremities.", "Katherine Owen", "Glenn, I\u2019ll take the first question. We haven\u2019t seen anything with our mix of businesses to suggest that there was some type of effect tied to ACA or changes in Obamacare. The nature of our procedure really don\u2019t lend themselves to it. The election was in November. So if you think about people who get hip and knee procedures specifically going into their primary, getting referred to a surgeon, scheduling that and then the holidays, it\u2019s just not something that we saw where there was a big rush of procedures.", "What we saw and all the evidence as we\u2019ve looked at this as you can imagine, so just it was normal seasonality. We\u2019ve seen a multi-year trend now of Q4 seasonality, more a function of rising deductibles than anything else. But there was nothing that we would point to as a stand out in Q4 to suggest that that trend was different, accelerated or indicative of greater than normal pull-through. And then I know you had a second question.", "Glenn Novarro", "Yes. Just on extremities, Kevin or Katherine, could you talk about the foot and ankle growth in the fourth quarter and the trends your businesses seeing? And then can you comment on shoulders? I know that\u2019s an area that you\u2019ve got a lot of new products coming out that you\u2019re excited about. Then maybe comment on foot, ankle and shoulders. Thanks.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure. So our foot and ankle business continues to perform extremely well, strong double-digit growth, so north of 15% growth in the fourth quarter and that just been a continuation of what you\u2019ve seen over the past four or five years, really pleased with the performance of that business. As it relates to upper extremities, we\u2019re still a relatively small player and we\u2019re starting to grow nicely. We have a both the total shoulder, the reverse shoulder and now we have a new fracture system, as well. So the only thing we\u2019re missing is just the partial, that\u2019s one product left to have a complete portfolio. But we have the main products that are needed to really be able to drive improved growth. And so I do expect upper extremities to be a positive for us. Although we are small and it\u2019s not a market growth story like it is in foot and ankle, we\u2019re going to have to take share, so it will probably take us a little longer than it did in foot and ankle to post those kinds of numbers. But we are encouraged. We have most of the portfolio cover now and we\u2019re well-positioned to start to grow in upper extremities.", "Operator", "Thank you. And next question comes from the line of Rick Wise from Stifel. You may proceed.", "Rick Wise", "Good afternoon, everybody. Let me start with capital priorities for 2017. Does the share repo just likely not much incremental M&A in 2017? You\u2019ve done Sage and Physio, et cetera. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate, right now with the MAKO launch, et cetera. So we should think 2017 might be less likely to see more M&A?", "Kevin Lobo", "You should definitely not read that in to it. $250million is a pretty modest amount of share repos and that\u2019s just offset dilution. We continue to be actively looking across our portfolios for acquisitions and we have the financial capacity to do more deals. Obviously if the deals don\u2019t materialize over a period of time, then we may want to do additional share repurchase. But our capital allocation strategy and velocity has not changed at all prior to as acquisitions and we have the capacity and the willingness to do more deals. Certainly, medical had a terrific year. Organically, while integrating two big acquisitions, but our other divisions all have bandwidth to be able to take on acquisitions.", "Rick Wise", "Okay. And Kevin just a follow-up, Europe, strong performer in your words, obviously you\u2019ve done a tremendous amount of positive work over the last several years, reestablishing, refocusing the European franchise. How much more opportunity is left, for I guess \u2013 for one of a better phrase that\u2019s a catch up growth. How do we think about the right growth they are over 2017 and beyond?", "Kevin Lobo", "So this Europe, we expect to continue to be accretive to Stryker\u2019s overall growth rate. And this is a multi-year platform for us. Its \u2013 Europe is only about 11% of our sales. And so if you look at most other med tech companies, it\u2019s a much larger proportion of their sales. We are really just scratching the surface with some of our divisions, if I look at endoscopy, if I look at instruments. We have huge growth potentials in front of us. Trauma, we already have a pretty good size business, but even as you saw in the fourth quarter, with our hip and knee business, we are very underpenetrated in Europe versus other markets.", "So I expect this to be a many year story and very excited about the progress we\u2019re making. Even divisions we\u2019re making spin are starting to turn around after years of being underrepresented. So expect this at least five years, five plus years you should expect Europe to continue to be a really positive story for us as we \u2013 as you say catch up to the market shares that we \u2013 should be having in those regions.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen. Your line is open.", "Josh Jennings", "Hi good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. I was hoping to first start off, Kevin and Katherine, about the MAKO halo effect. I know you\u2019ve seen some benefit from some of the installs over the last couple of years with MAKO under Stryker\u2019s roof. I wondered if you could give details in terms of what units you\u2019re seeing benefit from these MAKO installs to date, and whether the halo could get bigger and broader as we get into the total knee application?", "Kevin Lobo", "So I think the initial halo that we are seeing is really more limited to our joint replacement business. So if they buy a robot, even if they\u2019re not doing total knee is with Stryker with our triathlon knee they know that application is coming and they will start to get familiar with the implant. As 40% of those robots are in competitive accounts. So, that\u2019s part of the halo effect, and they start to get to learn about our company, they meet our salesperson, they understand how good our service is. I would say at this point that the Halo has really extended into the other divisions of Stryker. That usually takes longer, but that\u2019s what I would characterize as immediate Halo effect.", "Josh Jennings", "Great. If I could jut follow up with my understanding is you have a global hip cup launch early this year. Is that going to be at AAOS? And how big of a deal should we be thinking that could be? Is this similar to the 3D tibial plates and revision cones? Or, a more moderate impact? Thanks a lot.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes thanks. We are excited about this launch of [indiscernible] a modern 3D printed version. It\u2019s not as much of a game changer as the tibial base plate because today, all hips are being done without cement, and this cup, even though we really like it, it\u2019s very streamlined it has some very nice features, it\u2019s not causing you to change the way you do the procedure. Our 3D printed knee has enabled people to not use cement anymore and that\u2019s much more of a game changer, over 15% of our knees now are done without cement.", "So I wouldn\u2019t look at as explosive launch as the 3D printed product for knees, but still saw very nice addition, we had terrific innovations over the innovations over the past four or five years and are stems and now this is a really nice innovation in our cup. But I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a big game changing launch. It\u2019s a nice addition to our portfolio and hopefully that will help our sales force maintain some him focus on hips. As you know, they are very excited about Mako and so same sales force selling both knees and hips. But I\u2019d say it\u2019s a nice launch but more of an incremental launch.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor from Barclays. You may proceed.", "Young Li", "Hi, this is Young Li in for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess, first question, on 3D printing, we have a lot of 3D printing capability and expertise. It could be a more sophisticated manufacturing process. I was wondering if you can maybe talk about some of the areas of focus, in terms of maybe using it to introduce some new implants in orthopedics or spine?", "Kevin Lobo", "Right now, we are actually just trying to build capacity. The demand for 3D printing has been really explosive. You\u2019ve seen the growth that\u2019s been generated through our knee franchise. We\u2019re seeing same kind of growth in spine with the interbody device, we\u2019re going to launch more products, and frankly, we\u2019ve been capacity constrained in the spine area. So we have a series of innovative products and I would say our primary focus is really in joint replacement and in spine.", "And we\u2019re just building \u2013 we built a whole entire building that\u2019s going to be housed with only 3D printing machines in Cork, Ireland, and we are in the process of filling that building with machinery. We are not looking to replace any of our core products. We have the global hip cup that\u2019s going to be 3D printed.", "So, we think of it as launching new products, creating new innovations and really, it\u2019s focused on those areas. For now, trauma really has some ideas about some thoughts, but nothing really on the immediate horizon.", "Young Li", "Okay. Great. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess, MAKO, I was wondering if you can maybe provide some comments on your utilization trends, on a per robot or per doctor basis? Just wondering how much that\u2019s changed since you bought it?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, it\u2019s probably not a level of detail we are going to get into. Obviously, the value to the customers continue to increase as we\u2019ve layered on new indications, as well as being able to put power brands onto the robots. We are really pleased, and we\u2019ve been very thoughtful in terms of making sure whenever we place a robot, the surgeon champion is there to make sure these are utilized to their full capacity. So, again, we are pleased with what we\u2019ve seen since we acquired it, but we\u2019re probably not going to get into that level of detail.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum from William Blair. You may proceed.", "Kaila Krum", "Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Just thinking about large joint pricing, and you enter 2017 and recognizing a lot of pressures that are out there. But I\u2019m curious if you would see an opportunity, potentially, for more favorable contracted implant pricing just with the total knees, as surgeons become more dependent on you and the robot, and then just how that dynamic, specifically, might be incorporated into 2017, guidance, if at all?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, we assume a pretty stable pricing environment in ortho as well as for Stryker overall, as you heard Glenn referenced that 1.5% to 2% negative pricing that we are anticipating contemplates that. We don\u2019t assume any dramatic change in either direction and that dynamic regardless of the Mako launch.", "Kaila Krum", "Okay. Thanks. And then in your spine business, you mentioned a lot of the supply issues will continue into Q1. Can you just give us a sense for your level of confidence that those impacted customers will ultimately return in the second quarter, and just look gives you that level of confidence?", "Katherine Owen", "I just think given the strength of the portfolio overall, we\u2019ve launch some new products including 3D printed that have been really well received. And while it\u2019s never good to disappoint your customers, I think the strength of our sales force, their focus on the customers and their ability to go back with some differentiated products, I think they have work to do but we have confidence that they will be able to address those customer concerns.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, one thing I was really pleased about, I mean, our spine leadership team has managed through a very tough year, when you have these kind of product challenges, and the sales force, I was at our spine sales meeting recently. The mood was really terrific, we were able to retain our sales force something five, six years ago, I\u2019m not sure we would have been as successful. A lot of that is really the plans around 3D printing and other innovations. We have a pretty good pipeline coming. We have weathered the storm, and I think we are feeling we are in a good position, and will start to see that fruit in the second-quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch from BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good evening and thank you for taking the questions. There are two of them. The first one is, you\u2019ve been very good at keeping our expectations tempered for the MAKO ramp in 2017. But how, do we think about this in 2018 and beyond as sort of a continuously arcing adoption, or a multiplier effect? Or how do you internally think about the impact of your new product launches?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes, I think as it relates to MAKO, first of all, we\u2019ve never done a launch of this magnitude in something where we are fundamentally changing how orthopedics joint replacement is done and that\u2019s a way of saying there\u2019s a lot of unknowns. We feel really terrific about the limited release, taking the time to optimize the training protocol, to contemplate the needs of both, surgeons who have a strong understanding of robots, as well as those who don\u2019t. And as we talked about at the analyst meeting, that all went really, really well.", "So with the 50 or so surgeons trained we feel great about going into full commercial release, I\u2019m sure we learn a lot as this year unfold. But based on everything we\u2019re seeing and hearing, admittedly a lot of that\u2019s going to be anecdotal for now. We believe this is a game changer. So we would expect to continue to build on that momentum in 2018 and I think this is going to be a multi-year rollout and process of gaining market share as we not only continue to install new robots, but also the utilization of the coming up on 400 globally, and then the bulk of which were in the U.S., as those are all robots are upgraded to the total knee.", "So this is much more than a 2017, 2018 story. This will be a multi-year rollout.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you. And my follow-up is in terms of sales forces build? You commented that you\u2019ve been able to retain your spine sales force but thinking across orthopedics, where are you in terms of net ads?", "Kevin Lobo", "So, as it relates to MAKO, the ads are not so much in the sales force the ads are much more with the MAKOplasty specialist. So we have this clinical person that\u2019s in the operating room, helping the surgeon really make sure that that they can do the procedure. And our sales reps will have more room to hunt. So, the ads that we\u2019ve made obviously our extremities business has been growing very robustly and we\u2019ve been adding in the extremities sales force. Our sports medicine business has been strong double-digit growth. We\u2019ve been adding the sales reps in our sports medicine business.", "So, if you look at the areas of the business that are growing, I mean you are growing strong double-digits in a number of areas those are the areas where we continue to believe specialized sales forces drive growth", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. You may proceed.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Hey, good evening guys. Thanks for taking the question. So, one neurovascular one MAKO. So, Katherine, it looks like the surpassed U.S. trial was completed in December 2016. When are we going to see that data? When do expect U.S. approval? And can you remind us of the size of the U.S. flow toward market and I have one follow-up.", "Katherine Owen", "So, the one-year data, I\u2019ll follow-up on specifics but you are probably looking at late this year, or sometime at the beginning of 2018 and we\u2019re looking for a launch in the 2018 timeframe, probably the latter part.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Got it. And then on MAKO, Katherine, are you willing to share with us metrics for example, over the next five years representing total knee volume you think MAKO will represent? What percent of the installed base do think it will add the total knee application? And lastly, what percent of MAKO total knee procedures do expect to come from competitor surgeons? I know you\u2019ve given a metric like 40% of new system sales or to competitor surgeons. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. I think we need to get into the full commercial release. Again, this is new territory for us. I think we\u2019ve done everything we can to optimize our positioning ahead of the full commercial release. But it would be a level of specificity in detail we just don\u2019t have. So, we\u2019re really pleased that we have, as you mentioned, 40%-plus of the installs they went to competitive accounts. I think that speaks to how appealing this processes for a variety of surgeons.", "And as we get into the full commercial release we\u2019ll look and see what additional data make sense. But candidly, five years out, all I know is that if we\u2019re successful in the execution here we\u2019ll have captured meaningful market share. But it\u2019s premature right now to put out specific targets as to where we expect to be.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale from Guggenheim. Your line is open.", "Chris Pasquale", "Thanks. Kevin, now that you\u2019ve anniversary the tough emerging markets comps and you started to see some growth again. How do you back on offense there? I know, you\u2019ve said it won\u2019t be quick. But do you have what you need internally to get that piece of the business where it needs to be? Or do you need to think about supplementing that with some local assets or expertise?", "Kevin Lobo", "I think for us, our challenge is largely being more of people challenge than a product challenge. We are very small, we\u2019re subscale, we haven\u2019t necessarily made the investments like other companies have made with bricks and mortar training. So we really have \u2013 we\u2019re in the process of recruiting a new leader for China. I\u2019m happy with our India business. That\u2019s been really performing well over the past few years.", "But we\u2019re starting from a small place. Latin America has gone through a lot of challenges for us. We still have work to do, same in Turkey. So for us, its just a question of \u2013 we\u2019re subscale. And we are subscale attracting the best talent is really challenging. So, I would say for the next couple of years our focus is much more on talent and making sure we do the right kind of investments in training and education. That type of offense. We actually have very good products. In fact, I\u2019m very excited about some of the products we\u2019re launching that are lower priced. We\u2019re launching a new power tool called System G, which is getting great feedback it\u2019s a very new launch. We\u2019ve never done this before. A made for emerging markets product, we have the low-priced bed that\u2019s made in Turkey at our Muka facility.", "And then we have Trauson in which we \u2013 we had a good start with Trauson, but I would say with all the other challenges going on in China, that has been more challenge in the last year or two. So its really one of those stories, right. I think unlike Europe, we could see that if we just put a bit of spending behind Europe in specialization, we could turn that on very quickly because the business model is very similar to what we experience in Canada, the U.S., Australia, other markets where we\u2019ve been successful.", "Emerging markets requires a different kind of offense. And I don\u2019t want to over invest and really have the money go up in flames. So we\u2019re going to be a bit more measured. And the first step is to really make sure we have the right talent, which is frankly the key to our success in other markets. And that will be our first focus.", "Chris Pasquale", "That\u2019s helpful. And then can you just comment on the recent Lifepak recall and what impact that has on the Physio business? Is that a headwind for you? Or could you actually benefit from it, to the extent it encourages customers to think about upgrading?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. I would say right now it\u2019s premature on that front. We do have a limited ship old right now it is on an older generating AED product and we\u2019re working through that. We don\u2019t expect it to be a material issue. And I would also note it\u2019s not related to the competitor issues that are out there recently. So, we feel good about our pipeline of products and our ability to manage throughout this recall.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from SunTrust. You may proceed.", "Bruce Nudell", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, my first question, forgive my ignorance. But, what is the basis for product superiority of 3D printed products in cementless knees and revisions. And how does that potentially over the long run tie in with robots?", "Kevin Lobo", "So, there are two main benefits I would say, one is porosity. So you can really have a tremendously strong, so for titanium it\u2019s very strong but it is very porous, which enables the bone to grow into the implant. That\u2019s one, so porosity and geometry. I\u2019m not an expert, so engineers probably have five other things that they would tell you. But those are the high-level hop-to things. So geometry are the shapes of our 3D cones, you cannot make those shapes unless they are 3D printed.", "And they\u2019re beautiful for the surgeon to be able to drop in. It saves them a lot of time, fits the anatomy really well. The porosity, that\u2019s the reason why we can do cementless knees, is the bone grows in beautifully. We had a claim from the FDA for our spine interbody device that our device promotes bone in growth, unlike peak devices that obviously bone does not grow into the device. So it\u2019s porosity and it\u2019s geometry.", "Bruce Nudell", "Perfect. When you think about \u2013 it sounds like the MedSurg products, the core MedSurg products, are well configured for European demand. But could you contrast the size of the U.S. core MedSurg market versus that in Europe, and your relative shares?", "Kevin Lobo", "Well just at a very high level, and this is very high level I would say our market shares in Europe are about half the markets share we enjoy in the United States. Just to give you round numbers. That\u2019s actually the area where we have the most upside and those are the same competitors that we compete with in the United States. We have a long way to go in power tools. A long way to go on cameras. A long way to go in beds and I\u2019m really excited about the potential. Our emergency power cuts we\u2019ve done extremely well in Europe, but rest of the MedSurg portfolio we have significant runway given it\u2019s not like we\u2019re five share points low, we are about half our marketshares in many of these spots.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O\u2019Brien from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just to focus on gross margins for a little bit. Saw a pretty big step down after Sage and Physio. Q2 of last year, as you anniversary those, get more favorable mix, especially from neuro. Should we expect gross margins to start kicking higher in Q2, and throughout the course of the year?", "Kevin Lobo", "Matt, if you remember from Analyst Day we provided guidance around operating margin and top line. So we\u2019re not really going to provide additional guidance around the details of gross margin. I will say that \u2013 keep in mind \u2013 as you think about mix of our business is. As you think about MedSurg having slightly lower margin and Orthopaedics having slightly higher margins, a lot of that gets made up in term of the SG&A mix as that slows down to the operating margin line. So I think that\u2019s probably all we will guide relative to gross margin this year.", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Okay. Moving over to the MedSurg side of the business and endoscopy, one of your competitors is readying to launch there with some new visualization technologies. I\u2019m curious as far as how you feel about your position in the market from a technology perspective, and whether or not you need to upgrade some of your visualization capabilities? And if you\u2019d be even interested in doing something externally to help you out there?", "Kevin Lobo", "When you say upgrade do want to be more specific please and what you mean?", "Matthew O\u2019Brien", "Specifically philosophy and imaging there and your technologies, and if there\u2019s any improvement that you are expecting from new technologies over the next year or two, or if you look at external, to augment your capabilities?", "Kevin Lobo", "So we are not going to talk about the external areas that we\u2019re going to focus on. And we\u2019re also, not going to talk about product pipeline beyond what we\u2019ve indicated. We are really thrilled with our camera it operate extremely well. I\u2019m not sure if you are referring to \u2013 for open surgery DACs \u2013 XO scopes am not sure, I\u2019m really non sure what you are referring to every division has identified their pathway and their pipeline for innovation. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re talking about 3D. I\u2019m not sure if you are talking about what specifically you are referring to. What I tell you is the 1588 is only a year into the launch and it\u2019s getting fantastic feedback and I would expect that endoscopy continue to have terrific growth with 1588. They are on the lookout constantly for improvements to the product portfolio but we are going to talk about that until we end up consummating that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy from Jeffries. Your line is open.", "Raj Denhoy", "Hi thanks. I know it\u2019s late. Maybe two quick ones. Pricing, I think you gave us the metric for orthopedic pricing, and it did worsen a bit over the course of the year. I think it was 1.7% in the first quarter and now it\u2019s 2.5%. Is there anything to read into that? I\u2019m guessing you will say no, but I thought I\u2019d ask anyway.", "Kevin Lobo", "We haven\u2019t seen any big change. It does move around quarter-to-quarter and it depends on the timing of launches in selling days and no more quarterly in year-over-year variability, but I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that.", "Raj Denhoy", "Okay. Secondly, Sage and Physio-Control, I think you gave the growth rates there, 11.8% and 7.4%. Both doing quite well, and that\u2019s close to $1 billion in annual revenue that\u2019s about to move from your acquired into organic. Is there any reason to think that those businesses will slow in 2017? How do we think about the outlook there?", "Kevin Lobo", "No. As we said, we expect them, I think Glenn in his prepared comments, as we anniversary those in the second quarter they will be accretive to organic growth rate. Obviously we\u2019ve got a big base but those I sizable businesses. We continue to target double-digit growth for Sage and the types of gains we\u2019ve been seeing in Physio, that parts rolls out new products. I would underscored Glenn\u2019s comments regarding the first quarter the seasonality shift that will skew the year-over-year comps for Physio. That\u2019s really comparable basis. The underlying business as you\u2019ve seen in the three quarters we\u2019ve owned it, it looks terrific and we look forward for it to be another driver of organic growth.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "I would like to add this medical division of ours, to create deals of those sides and delivers for the full year in the U.S. almost 10% growth on the base business is really a terrific performance. To have that much business and still deliver that kind of growth on the base business is really outstanding.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Amit Hazan from Citi. Your may proceed.", "Lee Preston", "Hi, this is Lee Preston on for Amit. Two quick ones. For hips and knees, are you modeling any negative impact in your 2017 guidance for bundled payments at this point?", "Kevin Lobo", "We\u2019ve talked about bundled payments for the last couple of years and at no time have we ever said that bundled payments is going to be causing a problem to our growth. It\u2019s been around for five years on a commercial paying side and was CJR you\u2019ve just seen we\u2019ve come through year and the entire market had CJR in effect on the markets doing very well. Short answer is bundled payments is not a headwind for our hip and knee business. Not just for Stryker, but for the entire market.", "Lee Preston", "Okay. Got it. On Neurotech and spine, the segment operating margin was up a good amount in 2016. To what attempt is that sustainable?", "Kevin Lobo", "Neurotech and Spine?", "Lee Preston", "Yes.", "Kevin Lobo", "I\u2019m sorry.", "Katherine Owen", "So, we don\u2019t model out the individual op margin by the division, neuro, those are high-margin businesses for us. But we don\u2019t model out or provide guidance for the specific segments. We give that total company op margin 30 to 50 basis points target and that\u2019s one of the contributors to that.", "Kevin Lobo", "That\u2019s certainly, the Neurotech and Spine business are profitable businesses and they see in high grow business. So that\u2019s certainly that mix has helped the company.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the Richard Newitter from Leerink Partners. You may proceed.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, good evening. This is Robey in for Rich. Can you hear me?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. We can.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi, great. Thanks, for taking the questions. Just a couple. One on Mako and one on the longer-term strategic view. In the near term for MAKO, I know everyone is talking about four to five years \u2013 just curious. Can MAKO upon ramp or next 6-12 months driver of growth rate up \u2013 beyond this sort of nice mid-single-digit, high-single-digit level you\u2019ve come to into the double-digit territory? Are should we think of it more as sort of maybe cannibalizing some of your non-robotic is? And then secondly, just in terms of helping us engage risk around manufacturing, it sounds like you are working on this 3D printing plant in Ireland. How do we sort of factor in some of the comments at the administration is making around manufactured in America. As it pertains to Stryker\u2019s production and where your products are made? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Maybe I will just start with the first question. I would say we continue to anticipate, as we launch the total Knee, that it will help drive meaningful market share gains starting as we exit 2017, we are not assuming any cannibalization there will be those customers who continue to use triathlon traditionally and as you can see there\u2019s an strong demand as we continued to install and upgrade robots to the new knee application", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. As it relates to the second question, we have a very global manufacturing environments, which includes significant manufacturing in United States. We do have 3D printing machines here in United States as well is in Ireland. Obviously, we decided to have a purpose building and we are scaling up that manufacturing and then we also make implants here in United States and most of our MedSurg products are made in the U.S. So I think compared to other big multi-nationals of our size, I think we\u2019re actually pretty well-positioned regardless of \u2013if we have more attached or some type of offset to the lower corporate tax rate. I think we will be in pretty good shape.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thanks. And then maybe if I could squeeze one housekeeping question. I might\u2019ve missed this earlier due to some connection issue. What was the selling day impact in the quarter? Where there any extra fewer selling days in 4Q?", "Kevin Lobo", "Fourth quarter, there were no change in days. Same day as the year before.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Johnson from Robert Baird. You may proceed.", "Jeff Johnson", "Thank you. Good afternoon. Kevin, I will go back to your comments there just on the U.S. manufacturing. Is there any numbers you can give us \u2013 are there any number you can give us at this point on what percentage of your U.S. revenue is generated by products manufactured in the U.S.? It sounds like the answer is yes but you have some flexibility. I would assume you could move that around if you needed to from a quarter tax standpoint?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes. Jeff, this is Glenn. Right now, there\u2019s a lot of ambiguity around details of the specific broader tax. But as you look at our manufacturing footprint and when you look it, what we bring into the U.S. the sale, that might be made outside the U.S. We are roughly around a 50/50 split in terms of the impact to us.", "Jeff Johnson", "All right. That\u2019s helpful. And Kevin, maybe on guidance. Going back to the Analyst Day, 9% is the floor is the floor is the floor. If I adjust for FX and deal accretion in the ASU adjustment bring your 2017 guidance, I\u2019m closer to 7% to 9% EPS growth in your 2017 guidance. That\u2019s a lot of moving parts, I understand. But shall I just view that as a reason that kind of views, as assume your guidance is conservative here or there anything changed since the Analyst day? Just kind of how I think about that 7% to 9% \u2013 versus 9% being the floor?", "Kevin Lobo", "No. I think we can help you with that math that we can get offline. We are definitely not delivering a number below 9%. So I think there is something in your math that we can talk to you offline. We\u2019re definitely there is no change at all in our stands and this guidance firmly reflects. I think there might be something in the deal accretion that you might have off in your model. We will be happy to take that offline.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose from Canaccord Genuity. You may proceed.", "Kyle Rose", "Great, thanks for fit me in. I just had one quick question on the MAKO side. I appreciate not wanted to give significant long-term guidance. But just from a near-term perspective, just why don\u2019t you just give any color related to the amount of robots that have been upgraded to the knee application to date. How should we think about it with the 50 trained surgeons? I mean should we think about it as 50 sites or multiple surgeons at one site? Any insight there. And 86 robots year-to-date and great year-over-year growth just when you think about 2017 and balancing the upgrades to the knee application as well as seeking out some of the new placement. Did you thinking continue to grow the new placements at the rate that we saw year-over-year from 2016 versus 2015?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes. We are probably not going to get too specific in terms of outlook for robots installed obviously, we would look to continue to grow that. But keep in mind it is going to be balance between that and upgrading existing robots, as we mentioned. So it will be both of those drivers and we\u2019re not going to get into the level of detail around system upgrades and then you like it\u2019s probably getting down into the weeds a bit too much, particularly relative to the total size of the company.", "But we are really pleased with how the limited launch has gone. That\u2019s not only the training, the training protocol, the outcome of the experiences surgeons had as well as the training sites we\u2019ve been able to bring on board. We are in a great position for Academy. We will have roughly 50 surgeons trained. We have done a significant volume of surgeries that they will be well-positioned to help start the training and as we go through the year we will continue to give you data points that we think are relevant and we\u2019ll look to see how the year unfolds. So yes, expect more robots to be placed but probably too soon to start talking about exactly how much bigger year-over-year given this new dynamic of upgrades.", "Kevin Lobo", "What I would say is I\u2019m delighted with the MAKO capital sales force. They\u2019ve done terrific job selling these robots and in the fourth quarter doing upgrades and every quarter we will continue to tell you how many robots we\u2019ve sold.", "Kyle Rose", "Great, thank you very much.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. It just wanted to ask one housekeeping. The $250 million that you had mentioned you are going to be doing going forward, in the stock repurchases, is that included in the guidance, or is that something that you would continue to do on a one-off basis?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Hi, Krist. This is Glenn. It\u2019s included in the guidance.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay. Perfect. Just one other thing. Anything we should look at beyond AA West this year, in terms of either procedures or any other clinical meetings that may come up in terms of the Neurotech business, or endoscopy, or anything else?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. We will have a presence at a number of meetings. As you\u2019ll recall, in 2016 we had a presence at SAGES and NASS and the like. So as we get to Academy we will switch gears and start thinking about some of the additional meetings and what segments will be highlighted.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes. I wanted to say Kristen, we are starting to show up in a lot of these specialty meetings more and more. You talked about the extremities society. There\u2019s a whole series of those societies that we are showing up in sports medicine meetings. These smaller societies where we have very, very fast growth, with those big tend to be a lot more impact full. There\u2019s a large ACS type of meetings. We really large specialized business units with specialized sales force are more and more going to specialized conferences, something like SAGES for our endoscopy division. We\u2019re starting to see it\u2019s kind of shift where are these society meetings be specialized ones are much more impactful ever use of our time and money and we get great insight and new technologies. We get to just shows our surgeons or innovations and that\u2019s going to continue to be an engine of growth for us.", "Operator", "Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2017 results will be held on April 25. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Welcome to Stryker's second quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Katherine, who will discuss our pending acquisition of NOVADAQ and an update on Mako. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results before we open the call to Q&A.", "Our momentum continued in Q2 as we delivered organic sales growth of 6.7% in spite of one less selling day, which impacted total sales by approximately one percentage point of growth. All of our segments, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, delivered strong top-line gains and growth was well balanced graphically with organic growth of 7.2% in the U.S. and 5.5% in international. We continue to be pleased with our results in Europe and Canada with our Transatlantic Operating Model.", "Our first-half results reinforced the strength of our product portfolio, commercial execution and globalization effort. This has enabled us to exceed our original sales and earnings targets and is reflected in today's revised financial outlook for the year. We continue to deliver on our goal of achieving organic revenue growth at the high-end of medtech as we are gaining market share across the majority of our division and we continue to make investments to help drive growth longer term, while still delivering leveraged earning gains.", "The strong top-line and operating margin expansion contributed to an adjusted per share earnings increase of approximately 10%, topping the high-end of our range at $1.53 per share.", "As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are excited about the pending acquisition of NOVADAQ, which will add a key growth driver to our high-performing Endoscopy division. And despite the product challenges that we have had with Physio-Control and Sage, the latter of which we recently received a warning letter related to last year's recall, we remain on track with the EPS accretion for both deals as their growth will accelerate through the remainder of the year.", "Our full-year organic sales growth is now targeted at 6.5% to 7% and EPS of $6.45 to $6.55 per share. This excludes dilution from the NOVADAQ acquisition that Glenn will cover in his section.", "I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on the recently-announced plans to acquire NOVADAQ, along with an update on Mako and the Total Knee launch. Starting with NOVADAQ, as you know, in June, we announced the planned acquisition for approximately $701 million, net of cash totaling roughly $47 million. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood vessels and related tissue perfusion in a variety of procedures, including cardiac, general, colon and plastic surgery.", "The company, which is headquartered in Canada and was founded in 2000, aligns with Stryker's focus on enabling our customers to see and do more by enhancing cross-specialty surgical visualization. NOVADAQ's technology uniquely complements our portfolio of visualization technologies and will allow us to further build upon the highly successful launch of our latest generation 1588 Camera by expanding into new surgical procedures, including open surgery where we do not currently compete.", "Further, we believe NOVADAQ's SPY technology will help reduce post-procedure complication rates as well as the cost of care for a broad variety of surgical treatments. With our specialized sales force, we will be able to broaden the reach of NOVADAQ's technology as we look to leverage our highly complementary customer bases. We expect to close the transaction during the third quarter", "Turning to Mako, during the quarter, we installed a total of 26 Mako robots globally, an increase of over 50% year-over-year and reflecting 20 new robots in the U.S. Of note, we continue to see solid uptake for Mako upgrades, which remain on track and should position us to largely compete (05:37) all U.S. system upgrades during 2018.", "With respect to the new robot placement, approximately 40% continue to go into competitive accounts, where we have no to well below our normal market share. These placements are helping to drive our overall knee sales as our surgeons begin to use Triathlon Total Knee System in anticipation of Mako adoption. Moreover, we are able to introduce our broader knee portfolio to these new customers, including our highly successful 3D-printed tibial base plate and revision augments.", "Training on the Mako Total Knee continues at a solid pace with over 400 surgeons trained to-date, helping to drive Mako Total Knee surgery since launch to over 5,000. We are particularly pleased as we look at utilization rates, which have increased meaningfully for the Mako Total Knee, as well as the total hip application and is supporting the growth we are seeing in both franchises.", "On the clinical front, we are continuing to collect data comparing the Mako Total Knee to a traditional knee surgery, both utilizing Triathlon. These studies are looking at a number of standard outcome measurements, including hospital stay, return to work, range of motion, stability, discharge to rehab and patient satisfaction. We expect to begin to see some of the data at key orthopedic conferences starting in 2018 and beyond as we track these patients over time. As we look ahead to the remainder of 2017, we have strong order demand and continue to see mounting clinical interest. We believe this will help drive ongoing knee market share gains in 2018 and beyond.", "And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Katherine. My comments today will be focused on our second quarter financial results and the related performance drivers. The detailed financial data and results have been included in today' press release. Organic sales growth for the quarter was 6.7%. As a reminder, this quarter included one less selling day, which has the impact of reducing growth by roughly 1%.", "As previously stated, selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses. Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1.5% from the prior year, while foreign currency had an unfavorable impact of 0.8% on sales.", "In the U.S., we continue to see good momentum with organic sales growth of 7.2%. This strong growth was evident throughout several of our key divisions within our Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology segment.", "International organic sales growth of 5.5% was highlighted by solid performances in Europe and Australia. Our growth in emerging markets continues to recover, but also benefited from favorable year-over-year comparable. Both geographies were impacted by one less selling day.", "Our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.53 increased 10.1% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales growth, accretive acquisitions, operating expense control and the previously discussed benefit from the change in accounting guidance for tax benefits from certain stock compensation expenses now included in our tax provision. Our second-quarter EPS, as anticipated, was negatively impacted $0.04 by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates.", "Now, I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 6.5% and organic growth of 6.2%, including organic growth of 8.4% in the U.S. Our U.S. performance was highlighted by growth in knees of 7% and trauma and extremities at 10%, reflecting strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our foot and ankle portfolio and our Triathlon knee.", "Orthopaedics international delivered organic growth of 1.8% and included steady performances across all developed markets. MedSurg continued to have strong results in the quarter with constant currency growth of 6.8% and organic gains of 6.7%, which included a 6.9% increase in the U.S. instruments had U.S. organic sales growth of 4.2%.", "During the quarter, instruments executed its sampling plan for its newly launched System 8 drill and began several customer trials. We expect System 8 shipments will gain momentum into the third and fourth quarters as we have now shifted to full commercial launch. Endoscopy had another strong quarter with U.S. organic sales of 15.2%. This reflects continued strong demand for our 1588 video platform, booms and lights and sports medicine products.", "Medical had U.S. organic growth of 2.3%. This growth primarily reflects the impact related to the timing of shipments of our core bed, stretcher and power cot products. As you are aware, our core medical business is all capital and can be impacted by the timing of customer orders and the related shipment. We continue to see strong order growth in the core medical business.", "Our Sage business momentum improved during the quarter, following the previously discussed product recall. We are actively regaining customers that had switched during the recall and we are seeing solid performances in the other key products in the Sage portfolio. Subsequent to quarter-end, Sage received an FDA warning letter, which relates to an inspection last September shortly after we closed on the acquisition. We have already taken many steps to address the items outlined in the warning letter and will continue to work with the FDA toward resolution.", "This year's (11:04) results were impacted by continued supplier issues took earlier in the quarter in a tough quarterly comparable. Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 6%, which reflects strong Canadian, Australian sales and an easing of the metrics comparables in China. Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 7.9%. We continue to see strong global demand for our Neurotech products, which is somewhat offset by softness in our Spine business.", "Our U.S. Neurotech business posted growth of 10.3% for the quarter, highlighted by continued strong demand for our hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke products, CMF products and our neuro-powered instruments. Our U.S. Spine business continued to see softness as it recovers from supply issues early in the year, partly offset by high demand for our 3D-printed titanium products. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 13.1%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia.", "Now, I'll focus on operating highlights in the second quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.3% was up 10 basis points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting a favorable mix, offset primarily by price and foreign exchange related to certain businesses. R&D spending was 6.4% of sales. Our adjusted SG&A was 35% of sales, which was up 10 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This reflects favorable leverage from business mix and continued focus on operating expense improvements through our cost transformation for growth program. This favorability was offset by planned investments in our selling organization, including samples and sales rep adds, our CTG program, including our ERP implementation, and continued investments in our Mako TKA platform. In total, adjusted operating expenses were 41.3% of sales, which was flat compared to prior-year quarter.", "In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 25% of sales and 20 basis points better than the prior-year quarter. Our operating margin reflects good leverage, offset by key investments related to drive future operational savings and product growth platforms. We continue to remain confident in our ability to deliver our full-year commitment of 30 basis point to 50 basis point improvement in our operating margin.", "Lastly, as it relates to our full-year operating margin improvement, NOVADAQ is anticipated to be approximately 20 basis point dilutive to our operating margin for 2017, which would partially offset the expected 30 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement.", "Now, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other income/expense decreased from the prior-year quarter primarily due to increased interest income. Our second quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.3% reflects a larger-than-anticipated benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses. In the second half of the year, our tax rate will benefit from certain other geographical and operational changes that, combined with the aforementioned change in accounting, will result in an anticipated effective tax rate ranging from 16% to 17%.", "Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $3.7 billion of cash and marketable securities; of which, approximately 89% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.4 billion. Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations was approximately $801 million. Also, we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter.", "And now, I will discuss our third quarter and full-year guidance. Based on our past performance on our outlook for the remainder for the year, we now anticipate annual organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7% for 2017. As a reminder, the third quarter will have one less selling day as compared to 2016 and the fourth quarter will have the same number of selling days. The full year has one less selling day.", "If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the third quarter and full year to be negatively impacted by approximately 0.5% and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be negatively impacted by $0.02 in the third quarter and approximately $0.10 in the full year.", "For 2017, our adjusted net earnings per diluted share is now expected to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.55 per share, which excludes any anticipated dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ technologies. Based on the third quarter-end close date for NOVADAQ, the dilution is estimated to be approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per share.", "For the third quarter, we anticipate that adjusted net earnings per diluted share will be in the range of $1.50 to $1.55, which includes the aforementioned investment, foreign currency impact and the impact of the accounting change for stock compensation. Our third quarter range does not assume any dilution related to NOVADAQ. However, if the deal closes earlier than September 30, there will be additional dilution during the quarter.", "And now, we'll open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Your first call comes from the line Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. You may proceed.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Good afternoon and first off congratulations on another excellent quarter. Let me start with Mako, because I imagine it's probably topic one for people. Could you just talk a little bit about the upgrade process? I think when we last spoke probably on the topic, you had a pretty good backlog of centers requesting upgrades to existing systems. Could you give us a sense for what that backlog looks like today? And talk a little bit about kind of the obstacle, if you would, to installs and upgrades over the balance of the year. Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, Mike, thank you. And in terms of the upgrade process, we're really pleased with the pace of it. I think, as you know, the sales force is having to both sell new robots while also upgrading existing customers and we have a pretty sizable number of robots in the field. And based on how that's tracking, we feel comfortable, we'll be through that process next year.", "I think the biggest gating item right now is our ability to identify, hire and train the Mako specialists, who are critical to ensuring that not just the surgeon, but his entire OR staff is prepared to have a really successful experience as they start to adopt the Mako robot. So, that's really one of the key factors that we're continuing to hire those folks, who are probably looking right now if you wanted a total Mako knee robot today, the issue isn't us being able to build and get you a robot, the issue is getting you in the queue and getting you trained and through that process as we hire additional Mako specialists.", "So, you're probably looking at something late in Q4 before you are able actually to be in a position where you had it and you were good to go. So, that's not unexpected for us. That's why we really talked about this very methodical launch and we're really pleased with the pace of that that we're seeing right now.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So, essentially this is a five-month waiting period, if you would, if you ordered one today?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Roughly, approximately.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "That really depends, Mike, on where you're located in the country, if you already have a MAKOplasty specialist. So, that's sort of an average. It does vary based on where you are in the country and where the MAKOplasty specialists are. But our team is working very hard. We're obviously investing and Glenn talked about that in the first quarter and again this quarter. We are prioritizing investment to make sure that the waiting list is not too long for our customers and that we're pacing things appropriately. But so far, extremely pleased. Most importantly, the people who are using the total knee, the over 400 surgeons are having a very good experience and were getting very favorable feedback on the performance of the system.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And let me ask this if I could about two other businesses and then I'll let some others jump in. One, the Endoscopy business is obviously having a phenomenal year. It's year two of the launch. If you could just kind of update us on kind of where you think you are in this upgrade cycle for that business. Obviously, very strong first half of this year.", "And then, second, your U.S. spine business was a little light this quarter and one of your competitors announced a light quarter this evening as well. We had a number of data points kind of suggesting that the spine market was light, not only in the first quarter, but here in the second quarter as well. So, if you have any perspective on what's going on in the U.S. spine market, that'd be appreciated. Thanks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. I'll take the Endoscopy question and I'll turn it to Katherine for spine. So, certainly the Endoscopy division is really performing well. I would say that the camera launches \u2013 year two we've always said is kind of the year where rib things (20:32) really pick up. We had a good year last year and even better year this year, but I would say they're firing on all three cylinders. So it's not just about the camera. The booms and lights are also doing extremely well in our communications business.", "And sports medicine, which is obviously a smaller business, is absolutely on fire. So, that business has been growing strong double-digits for a number of years, continues to outpace the market and we've done some very good small acquisitions, whether it's pivot for hip arthroscopy or recently Ivy Sports Medicine. These acquisitions are helping to contribute to a really strong growth. So, across the board the business is being very, very well managed and that gives me a lot of excitement as we do NOVADAQ to really add gas to the fire of Endoscopy. And I'll turn it to Katherine for spine.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Kevin got endo and I get spine. So, I think it's safe to say we still -we have some challenges there and I think also based on some of the numbers have come in, the market overall looks to be challenged certainly in this quarter. We've had some Stryker issues as we work through some of the supply challenges, but on the positive front, those do appear to be moderating for us. And we're also seeing really strong demand, but we are capacity constrained for our Tritanium products. And so, we're going to continue to invest in that portfolio. We have a number of products in the R&D queue for that area. And so, over the longer term, we expect to see an improvement, but clearly it's been a little bit more challenging for us both due to some of our issues, but also a market that just seems to be a little bit softer than expected in the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America. You may proceed.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, we can.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Good afternoon. So, two questions; first one on clarifying guidance and then one on Mako. On the guidance question, I just want to clarify that the new EPS guidance excludes NOVADAQ dilution. And then, I also was wondering if you could just kind of clarify the new revenue growth guidance as well. Is the right way to think about it essentially that the back-half guidance or the back-half growth is going to essentially be very similar to the front half growth?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yes. Bob, in terms of guidance, the $6.45 to $6.55 per share excludes any dilution from the NOVADAQ transaction. And in terms of revenue guidance, yeah, I think if you think about the back half of the year, it probably will continue at a similar pace as the first half of the year.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I just wanted to clarify that. And then, the second question I wanted to ask was on Mako. It looks like you had a fantastic quarter in terms of training physicians relative to comments that you offered us on the last quarter. So, I know you're giving us information on the percentage of placements that are going into competitive accounts, but one thing that I'm really interested in is of the people that you're training right now, these roughly 200 docs it looks like that you trained in the quarter, what percentage of those physicians are \"competitive physicians?\"", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Well, it's going to largely mirror. We're training the competitive surgeons, because as we put a robot in, they need to get trained on it. And what you're also seeing reflected in our knee numbers, Bob, is as they get a new robot, one of the first steps if they are a competitive account and they haven't any real experience often with Triathlon as they start doing traditional knee procedures, traditional open knee procedures, but now using Triathlon to start to get used to that product. So, that's some of the halo effect we referenced. But as we start to train surgeons, by definition, as we're putting roughly 40% of the robots into new customers, we're going to have \u2013 I don't think it mirrors 100%, but it's going to be a good approximation of who is getting trained.", "Operator", "Your next call comes from the line of David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Just one strategic one for Kevin and a couple of just quick hits. So, Kevin, the growth is stellar, but I want to bring us back to the Analyst Day and the now infamous 9% EPS floor comment, if you would. So, you're certainly delivering above the floor. There's no question about that, but you're also reinvesting very aggressively for growth. So, could you just speak to the level of reinvestment for those investors who may expect more EPS drop-through on these very lofty organic growth rates?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So, David, thanks for the question. And certainly we did raise the EPS as well as raising our top-line. So, I just want to make sure you saw that, but clearly, if we're in a momentum where we're gaining on the top-line, we'll always look to do some level of reinvestment. We have committed to improving our operating margin as well. So, there isn't a one-for-one like that you used to see maybe in the past where we would deliver more top-line and spend at an even more aggressive rate. But we have this generational opportunity with Mako, where we're going to use some opportunity to invest behind that and also have a responsible level of drop-through. If the reverse occurred and our sales growth slowed, you would certainly expect us to dial down the expenses.", "And so, we're being prudent about it, but we have raised our EPS guidance, I think, to an appropriate level. And we'll continue to fuel. I mean, we have an offense that's been really rolling for the past four years and I think what you've seen in the last two years is really good EPS drop-through. And some of that's come through tax, obviously, but a lot of that's coming through our operations. So, I think you should continue to expect if the top-line continues to run hot that we will take a portion to reinvest and, obviously, drop through the remainder.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Very clear. And just two quick ones from me. Glenn, just the components of the $0.10 raise, the components there that are FX and the tax suppression from stock-based comp. And then, Katherine, just on the instruments business, the only business we saw that had kind of momentum was a little weaker. Obviously, that business tends to bounce around, but anything instruments that's important to call out? Thanks so much.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Yes. On the component of the raise, FX is moderating. So, it won't be as big as it was in the first half. I think in the first half, we probably had around $0.08 per share, if you look at what we had. I'm guessing that it will be about $0.05 or so in the back half. No, not $0.05, probably $0.02 in the back half. And then, in terms of the components of the tax, I think in addition to the stock comp, we also implemented some other changes geographically that will benefit us in the back half of the year and that's probably roughly a 0.5% point on our tax rate.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, but the way to think about it, David, is we had said in the last quarter $0.10 to $0.12 was FX. Now, Glenn saying about 10%, so \u2013 $0.10. So pretty modest amount from FX and that, obviously, could change if exchange rates change. Obviously, we've had a pretty rapid appreciation of the euro recently and we're using today's FX rates for that. So it's pretty modest, the FX impact. We also don't have a lot of business OUS as some of our competitors do. And then, if you look at the rest, it's really mostly operational. Again, there's a little bit of tax, but mostly operational.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah and then just on your question on instruments and the U.S. performance, I think the main focus for the team in the quarter was the System 8 launch and it was really about getting the sampling plan in place and beginning some of the customer trials. Obviously, there's not a big revenue generation associated with that. We're now in full commercial launch. So, we feel pretty excited based on our history of launching next-generation power tools and understanding that upgrade cycle to see an acceleration in that business in the second half as we move away from the sampling stage.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Chris Pasquale of Guggenheim. You may proceed.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks. Let's talk a little bit more about the different components of the medical business this quarter, what the growth rates were for Sage, Physio and then the legacy Stryker product lines.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Thanks for the question. Now that they are fully in the business post one-year acquisition, we don't break those out anymore just because they're not material to the total company. So, we typically if it's of size give the growth rates for newly acquired business through the first year, after which we consider it to be part of organic growth. We did see improvement in those businesses per se. Did they start to recapture business that they lost due to some of the recall challenges and also for Physio recognizing that they are having some supplier disruption?", "So feel confident that there's no change to the full-year EPS accretion, associated those deals that we originally announced and also feel confident that we'll continue to see quarter-to-quarter improvement in those businesses as they work through some of those challenges associated with those deals. But we're not going to break out with specificity as we did through the first four quarters nor do we with other deals that after we announce them.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. Maybe \u2013 yeah, go ahead, Kevin", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Just a little extra color. So our legacy medical business, the core medical business of beds and stretchers and cots as you may remember had a huge quarter in the second quarter last year, about 17% growth. And they have very, very good orders, but didn't have a very strong shipment quarter. And what we've seen in the past with our medical business is it's a bit more volatile from quarter-to-quarter, but the order book is really strong. So although the medical number is a little soft this quarter, the outlook for the medical division is very strong not only for the remainder of this year but for the future.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks for that. And can you spend a minute on the competitive landscape in recon at the moment? By our math, you picked up some solid share again this quarter, particularly in the U.S., and you've really been enjoying that momentum now for the last four quarters or so, even pre-dating some of this recent strength with Mako. So, how much of that momentum that you've had do you think is related to sort of product-specific things that you guys have been doing versus maybe some competitors who have been in a tougher spot? And do you expect to keep that share as they get back on their feet? Thank you.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Thank you for the question. I would tell you that we're focused on executing on a strategy that's been underway for a couple of years now. So, it's nothing new in terms of really having highly focused sales force that we're continuing to make investments in as we talk about making investments to drive longer-term growth. That's part of it. We also have seen real uptake over the last X number of quarters from our new product portfolio and the investments we made over the years in 3D printing to be able to give us some really unique product offering that if you look at our cementless offering is now approaching, 20% of our knees are now cementless, which is vastly different than to the overall market, which is still in the low-single digits.", "And we talk about that Mako halo effect to be able to go in and sell the full portfolio of our knee and hip products when we get into competitive accounts is certainly helping to drive the growth. So, we're gaining market shares in knees as we have been. We feel like we're holding our own in hips, but also are pleased with some of the impact. Our renewed focus there is having \u2013 and expect that business to continue to improve. So, it's really difficult to slice out where all the share is coming from, but we feel confident in our ability to continue to execute on the strategy that's been working really well for us over the last few years.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Rick Wise of Stifel. You may proceed.", "Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Good afternoon, everybody. Kevin, maybe talk to us about where you are in China these days. You had easier comps. That was good. Just maybe some more color on the underlying business growth and what's still left to do from an investment point of view. Just your latest thoughts there.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So, China had a good quarter, double-digit growth in the quarter. But I would say that's more to do with the comparatives than really having a big and strong business in China. As you know, we had a couple years of difficulties in China. We're starting to right the ship. I'm feeling encouraged by the progress that we're making, but we have a long way to go still. We are looking to appoint a new leader in China. That search process is progressing. Obviously a very important role for the future of our business in China. We're also doing a lot of work with our Trauson portfolio as well, both for inside of China as well as for export.", "I would say it's still early days, Rick. We still have a long way to go. I'm glad that it's no longer a headwind for the company and having double-digit growth in China is certainly a positive. But certainly given our low market share, the potential is enormous and we are just starting to tap into that potential. So many, many more years to come of progress, but it starts with talent and we don't yet have our new China leader, but we're getting close.", "Frederick Allen Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thank you. And, Katherine, maybe back on NOVADAQ, you highlighted a couple things, open surgery where you don't compete is an opportunity, it seems like connected to Endoscopy, but maybe just add a little bit more color if you could about what you can do with NOVADAQ in your hands that can accelerate growth and the opportunity and if you just expand on some of your comments. Thanks so much.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, I think the biggest benefit to us is they have outstanding technology that gives us access to new procedures for a customer base that we call on and we have commercial sales execution that's been built up over decades. We have a considerably larger sales footprint and the expertise to be able to sell these products effectively to gain access to new accounts where we already have a presence and to be able to sell our portfolio into customers where they have a presence.", "So I think it's a really nice marriage of commercial excellence, our own very well accepted in the market visualization technologies and then bringing in what is very complementary visualization technologies to expand the customer base and the procedure that we can address.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Matt Miksic of UBS. You may proceed.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. And just one follow-up on Mako, I'd love to get a sense, if you could provide some sense of the types of hospitals that you're seeing the most active in new system placements? So mid-size hospitals, urban hospitals, any smaller centers, privately held hospitals? Just a couple of examples would be very helpful and then I have one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, thanks. It's really all of the above. The way we have gone about the launch of this, which has proven to be very successful, is focusing on where we have a very strong surgeon champion and that's what's really helping to ensure that the adoption in utilization of the robot continues to accelerate and that includes urban, it includes rural, it's big practices, it's small practices. There is no single specific type of Mako customer. It really covers the entire landscape that you described. And that's where we focused our activities, first and foremost is there a surgeon champion, and are they committed to the process and that's what really drives both the adoption in the hospital and then the utilization rates afterwards.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "That's great. And then same topic, just trying to get a sense of what the sales cycle of the system is like. As you know, one of your competitors is out sort of talking about having a robot in the future. I'm just wondering if in this environment, whether it's just the health care environment in general or if it's any actions that your competitors have taken have like extended the sales cycle or tightened it or what do you see in terms of just the pace of new placements?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I'm assuming you're referring to Mako, specifically?", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Yes.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, so, no, we haven't seen any impact. This is really about identifying surgeon champions and then when our team goes in and does a terrific job of detailing the features and benefits and as they get exposure to it, whether it's events like the Academy meeting we had or another surgeon in their hospital who is using the robot, all of those lead to that word of mouth and mounting interest as they start to hear more about the experience from the key opinion leaders.", "So there's been no impact we've seen, whether it's from hospital spending or competitive movements. We're just really focused on what has been a really successful launch as we went from initial launch now to full commercial launch. We're ramping up the number of surgeons trained at 400. We've got over 5,000 procedures. Obviously that continues to grow quarter-to-quarter. We're upgrading the existing robots as well as selling new robots. So really focused on a game plan that seems to be working very well for us.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "And if we have a surgeon that's really interested in the champion in a hospital that gets behind the surgeon, to us, we welcome the competition. We really believe we have a winning solution and so if there is something competitive that resembles our offering or that even purports to resemble our offering, we sort of welcome that challenge and look forward to it.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Bruce Nudell of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. You may proceed.", "Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call. Kevin or Katherine, I guess, you've rolled Mako out very carefully to ensure quality outcomes. And I'm sure you have a sense now of the short-term outcomes that are attainable in terms of range of motion, pain, stability, discharge to institutional rehab. Do you feel that the results that you'll formally publish in the next year or so will be compelling enough to make surgeons feel that they're actually doing their patients a disservice for not using robotically-assisted implants?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, I think we're still in a wait and see. We are collecting that data right now, so it'd be premature to get out in front and make claims until we actually have sufficient data collected. We've got a number of centers collecting data, as I mentioned, comparing Triathlon on the robot to traditional Triathlon and looking at some very standard follow-up measurements that would speak to some of your comments.", "But until that data is collected, we have follow-up, we crunch the data, we submit it to the different meetings, it would be premature to get in front of it. We're really pleased with anecdotal feedback, but that's anecdotal and I don't want to start to make speculation about what the clinical data would look like, other than to say we're committed to collecting the data and continue to believe that this will have a positive impact on patient and customer experience.", "Bruce M. Nudell - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "And I guess just going back to Sage and Physio, my recollection was, just on a directional basis, you felt Sage or Physio, rather, could sustainably grow in the high-single digits for a period and that Sage had double-digit potential. And I know you're not going to break things out any longer, but are those aspirational goals still intact?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, certainly this is not what occurred in the second quarter. But in terms of over the long term, we absolutely still remain committed to those kinds of goals and we see that in the pipeline of the products and in the teams that we have out there. So these are very good businesses. We are very pleased to have acquired them. They didn't have those kinds of numbers in the second quarter, but we do see that as a resumption of the pipeline within Physio and as Sage gets the recall behind us, we absolutely see those kinds of numbers going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo. You may proceed.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. One on ischemic stroke, one on Mako. You called out the strength in your ischemic stroke business earlier and the Neurotech growth was quite healthy this quarter. So I guess my question is have we already started seeing an impact from the DAWN trial and what's the timing of the publication? And I had one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, it's really difficult to point to a single factor and that was relatively recently. I will say, we saw solid growth both in ischemic as well as hemorrhagic in the quarter. So, really pleased with the performance on both sides. I don't have an update on the timing for publication of the DAWN data. I think you really have to look at all of those factors, DAWN and some of the previous studies that have come out, that are contributing to the interest in ischemic treatments that are mechanical based. There's still a lot of work that has to be done on the referral channel as we've talked about.", "So, I think that's a business that we expect, overall, very healthy growth, but it's going to vary quarter to quarter based on the timing of some of these studies as well as the investments that we and our competitors are making to really help build the referral channel, which is going to be a multiyear process.", "Larry Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. And then, on Mako, Katherine, I didn't hear the total number of applications out there. I think there were 90 at the end of first quarter. Can you give us an update on that? And do you still expect to exit the year taking share? You're already growing, I think, your knee business in the high-single digits. Can that really improve from here? Thanks for taking the questions.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Sure. No problem. So, we give the new robot installations that we've done. We have not reported any numbers on upgrades other than to say that we're pleased with the pace and we're on track to have the upgrades of all of the robots in the U.S. or the vast majority that will be upgraded in 2018. But we haven't broken out specific numbers on the upgrades. And then your second question? I apologize.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Continued knee growth.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Oh, the knee growth, so, yes, we continue to believe that as we get more surgeons trained and the base of those doing the procedure will allow us to drive stronger knee market share as we exit 2017. So, I think you should kind of think about a rolling four-quarter knee growth and that's kind of the base we assume we'll improve upon as we get further into the full commercial launch and we think the first evidence of that will be as we exit 2017.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First question was on margins. Would be interested in a status update regarding some of the goals you have to increase capacity across your manufacturing locations as part of the long-term goal to drive margins and then also any status update on your global ERP program. I know that you're working on eventually consolidating that and so I'd be interested in some of the key milestones we can expect there over the next 12 months or so.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, Isaac, we outlined the program back at our Analyst Meeting and it was a five-year kind of program. We actually have made very good progress relative to our product life cycle management, which is what I think you're referring to, which is really a SKU rationalization program that we're putting in place to sort of harmonize what versions of products we sell across multiple geographies. And so, we're in year two of that plan and it's a multi-year implementation. So, we're not necessarily seeing results, but we are making good progress on the implementation.", "And then, related to our ERP program, this too was a four-year program where we're putting in SAP globally. We're also rolling out global processes, which will help us become more efficient in terms of how we manage the various financial functions across the world. Relative to that project, obviously, you can imagine that's a very big project. We've seen really good progress on the systems side and the business side and we expect sometime within the next six months to have our initial implementation and rollout of the first wave of that. And then, upon the successful wave of that, we'll continue with rollouts across various businesses until we complete all the businesses across the globe.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. So, maybe as a follow-up, if I interpret your comments there correctly, is it fair to say that we'll see some of the results of those efforts translated into the P&L early 2018 or could be later in the year? Just trying to think through timing of when this becomes a little more tangible on the bottom line. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, I really think it's later in 2018, second half, fourth quarter 2018 before we start to see some of the meaningful results of that work.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "And as we laid out with cost transformation, we did say 30 basis points to 50 basis points over the next few years. In the early years, it will be closer to 30 basis points. There are some elements like indirect procurement, shared services where we'll get savings earlier. The areas like the ERP systems and product life cycle management will drive much higher savings in the outer years, but it's a multi-year multi-facetted program. It's working so far and we're getting some early returns at least as it relates to indirect procurement. But the bigger prize will come with product lifecycle management and as you mentioned with ERP, which will begin sort of towards the end of 2018 and continue in the years after that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Kaila Krum of William Blair. You may proceed.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So, just a couple from me. So, I guess, as it relates to the NOVADAQ deal, just a bit more color around kind of initial goals, steps for integration there once the deal does close. What sort of feedback or initial excitement have you been hearing from your sales force there?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, the sales force is extremely excited. This is a highly complementary technology. It expands their customer base. It allows them to further leverage the expertise we have with our own visualization technologies and it's a sell process that they understand. So, there's a lot of excitement. I think we've got to get to closing before we start to really articulate some of our plans, but, obviously, we anticipate a lot of synergies to be realized given how complementary this business is.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "And, Kaila, I'd just add that as surgeons, if you think about the top KOLs within the Sage's group of surgeons, I've received numerous calls directly from surgeons in that leading association who were really excited, because they see this combination as very, very powerful for them. So, when a customer gets excited about the combination of competencies, that's always a good indicator that we're going to have commercial success.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Great. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess, just touching on your foot and ankle business, has there been any update there as it relates to market trends, your competitive stance? Any additional color there would be helpful. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, so this has been a great business for us, as you know, for probably five years now. And we've had terrific success whether it's with our total ankle as well as Anchorage plates. We did an acquisition a little while ago called Instratek, which also fortified that business and that deal is going extremely well.", "So, the offense that we have with our dedicated sales force that we put in place a number of years ago, our really good leadership and our product portfolio, we're in a great position, we're growing much faster than the market and have been for some time and we expect that to continue.", "The beauty of this market is it's a growth market. So you're having implants put in where they weren't put in before and just like ischemic stroke is for neurovascular, that's what foot and ankle is to our trauma and extremities business. An expanding market and continuing to grow at very, very strong double digits.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Matt Taylor of Barclays. You may proceed.", "Young Li - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. This is actually Young Li in for Matt. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess the first question just on the warning letter, can you maybe talk about any early feedback you've been getting from the FDA so far? Since you've not really changed any deal assumptions, what gives you the confidence that the warning letter won't become a more disruptive issue? And are there any impacts on new product approvals or would it impact any other manufacturing facilities?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks for the question. I will tell you that this was an inspection that happened shortly after we closed the deal. We have been addressing with the FDA a number of the issues that were raised in the warning letter. And we obviously take this very seriously and will continue to dialogue with them to resolve the outstanding issues. There are no product holds related with this warning letter nor does it impact other parts of the business. So, we're highly focused on addressing their concerns and we'll continue to provide you updates as we work through some of the items that have been outlined in what were three observations in this warning letter.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, so what I would say is, it did disrupt our business to some degree. That disruption is now over, as Katherine mentioned, no longer a ship hold, I would say the business is sort of back to business in a very normal way. Obviously we do need to finish our remediation efforts, but it's not requiring any significant amount of investment and the business is sort of back on track.", "Young Li - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. That's very helpful. And I guess a follow-up on the foot and ankle market, but just wondering with the positive CMS reimbursement update for total ankles, can you maybe talk about what that could mean for your business? Is there any ability to take up price? And also I guess how important is having a revision ankle in your portfolio? How impactful could that be?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So, obviously we're very pleased with the change in reimbursement. I would tell you that we were getting pretty good price all along and so I'm not sure that there's going to be a significant opportunity to increase price. But what the lower reimbursement was doing was dampening the momentum in the market. It was a very small part of the market and we think now that this will unlock growth for the entire market. So, all competitors will be able to increase growth.", "I think revision is something that we'll obviously be looking at for the future. It's still a very nascent market. So, I don't believe that that's a major concern within our portfolio. You've seen our growth. We're able to grow at very high rates without a revision offering, but that's obviously something that we'll address over time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Josh Jennings of Cowen. You may proceed.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good evening. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, Kevin, do you think Stryker is experiencing a benefit from opportunities in competitive accounts or have your team's been able to hire away high-quality sales reps due to your competitors supply constraint issues particularly in hips and knees? And has Stryker implemented any specific strategies in the short term to take advantage of any vulnerabilities?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I tell you, Josh, I think really what you're seeing out of our joint replacement group is a focus on a strategy that has worked for us for a number of years. So we're continuing to invest in our sales force and that doesn't necessarily mean it's coming from competitive reps. We're continuing to leverage the portfolio of products that we've launched in recent years and obviously highly focused on Mako.", "So, to the degree there's disruption in the marketplace, obviously we're going to try and take advantage of that, but it really is a strategy that was well under way prior to anything that's been happening on the competitive front and one that we think is working well for us and we're going to continue to execute on.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "I would say that we do receive a lot of inbound calls and I'm not saying that that's related directly to supply issues, but if you have an offering nobody else has with robotics or 3D printing and you have momentum in the market, well, obviously, that is felt by the sales forces competitively. So, the phones are ringing. That's a good sign. I don't believe that it's ever driven by just one thing, whether it's just a supply disruption or just one thing. And our strategy is just to continue to drive high growth and as the phone calls ring, we'll see if these people fit our culture. And if we believe that that'll be additive to our growth, then obviously we'll look to hire them. But we don't have a specific let's-go-hunt-for-sales-force plan and we don't really need to, given the kind of strength we have in the market.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Understood. Thanks. And just one follow-up on Mako. I was just wondering if implant pricing contracting is evolving, just imagine if some of these centers are dedicating them to developing robotics program that they may be interested in locking in multiyear contracts just to do the exclusivity of the Mako platform. And the, how do you see, if you're not seeing anything in those early days, how do you see Mako helping on the implant pricing side of the equation in terms of maybe multiyear stabilization in some accounts? Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So, right now, most of the implant pricing is on multi-year contracts to begin with, regardless of whether there's a Mako in the account or not. And most of the procedures are done without the use of the robot. And so, we continue to want to provide competitive pricing to our accounts and over time, with the adoption of Mako, if it becomes more broad, then obviously that will provide more insulation for us. But certainly at the moment, it's very competitive, as you see in our price decrease quarter after quarter after quarter is pretty consistent to what it has been over the past eight or nine quarters. So, it's pretty steady. It's a moderating decline, but it's still going to be a decline. And I would assume, at least for the next foreseeable future, next couple of years, that you should probably see similar types of pricing. Over time, we'll see how that evolves.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next call comes from the line of Brittany Henderson of Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.", "Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just a quick follow-up on Mako. I know that the focus right now is just on the U.S. total knee launch, but I was hoping you could give us an update as to the demand that you're seeing for Mako in international markets. How should we just think about the Mako opportunity internationally, especially given some of the variant reimbursement structures that we have in place overseas?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. So, we're really seeing a pickup in interest internationally. Australia has been a fantastic market for us. They already did \u2013 many of their knees were done and navigated. Probably the highest percentage in the world, so they were \u2013 for them it's an easy adoption to move from navigated knees to robotic. That's been a strong market for us. But we've seen interest across a range of countries. We have a robot in China, in India, in Vietnam. Europe is starting to really pick up, which is exciting. But it's going to vary by country. So we have Germany, Italy, the U.K. Those are going to be very good markets. I think other markets such as France and Canada will take longer.", "So, it really is country by country and I think a good analog to look at would be Intuitive. If you think about how they expanded geographically, it was sort of very similar, which certain countries are much more friendly towards the adoption of new technology. We don't yet have any robots in Japan. We look forward to getting approval for Mako later this year. And, as you know, with Intuitive, you see that's a very attractive market for us and we look forward to being able to launch Mako in Japan. But I would say it's a broad range of countries and it's very similar, the pattern that we're seeing is a similar pattern to what Intuitive saw with their da Vinci robot.", "Brittany Henderson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. That's great. Thank you. And then, just one kind of more big picture question. I was hoping you could just talk to us a bit about your strategy and portfolio positioning in the ambulatory surgery center, especially as it relates to large joints. And I just ask that because of the recent proposed rule that we saw from CMS, which proposed total knee and total hip procedures be added to the ASC list. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Sure. So, we already are pretty active in ASCs for our sports medicine business and we have other products that we sell into that channel. So, it's a channel that we know. Today, there's still a very small percentage of total joints that are done in the ASC. A lot of noise around it and I do believe that over time that trend will increase, but we're well prepared to win both in the in-hospital as well as in the ASC market, but I do expect that it's going to be a pretty small number at least for the next few quarters.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Thank you all for joining our call. As you can see, we have very good momentum in our business and our conference call for the third-quarter 2017 will be held on October 26. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Andrew and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Welcome to Stryker's third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Katherine, who will have an update on Mako, along with comments on our recently completed acquisition of NOVADAQ and the VEXIM deal. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before we open the call to Q&A.", "Our Q3 organic sales growth of 5.5% reflected continued strong performance, despite weather-related challenges, the previously announced Sage product issues, and one less selling day. We estimate the combined impact of Sage and weather negatively impacted our Q3 sales by approximately 240 basis points versus 2016.", "We benefited from standout performances in Neurotechnology, Endoscopy, Trauma and Extremities, and Mako, as well as double-digit growth in both our legacy Medical businesses and Physio-Control.", "Turning to Puerto Rico, as many of you are aware, we have a manufacturing facility on the island which produces products for our Endoscopy and Instruments divisions. We are extremely pleased with how our team has managed through this unprecedented disaster and, most importantly, we can report that we've had contact from 100% of our employees.", "Stryker has formed a Puerto Rico fund to aid employees specifically affected by the hurricane and is providing direct financial aid with all employee contributions matched dollar-for-dollar by the company.", "With respect to our customers, through the preparation and deployment of our business continuity plans, we've seen minimal disruption to product supply and do not anticipate any material financial impact going forward.", "The safety stock stored in our U.S. central distribution center has maintained customer supply, while we restore our manufacturing operations and supply chain. The facility is currently ramping up production, and newly manufactured goods are being shipped from the island.", "Against this backdrop, I'd like to take a moment and recognize the outstanding work of our Global Quality and Operations organization in Puerto Rico and around the globe in minimizing these supply disruptions.", "In Houston and Florida, given the impact of the hurricanes, there were canceled procedures during Q3 and some delays to capital purchases. We expect those procedures and capital purchases to be rescheduled and don't anticipate any meaningful impact to our business in Q4.", "Turning to Sage. In August, we announced a recall of certain products and a ship hold of other products as we switched to a new testing methodology. Encouragingly, we began shipping products during September and have now commenced shipments from all product families.", "We have work to do with our customers, given the disruption these events caused to their practices. Given Sage's market leadership position, which reflects the value-add of their product portfolio, we expect to regain lost market share over the coming quarters.", "Overall, our third quarter presented our teams with a number of unique challenges that were largely unexpected. Given the strength of our diversified portfolio, effective business continuity planning and commitment of our employees around the globe, we're able to largely meet the needs of our physician and hospital customers.", "As we look ahead to the balance of the year, we are excited about the recent acquisition of NOVADAQ and the VEXIM deal, which will help ensure we continue to deliver organic sales growth at the high end of med tech.", "We expect full-year organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7% and adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.50 per share, despite incurring the added dilution associated with the NOVADAQ acquisition.", "I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Kevin. My comments today will focus on an update on Mako, the recent NOVADAQ acquisition and the VEXIM deal announced earlier this week.", "Starting with Mako, during Q3, we sold a total of 33 robots, of which 23 were in the U.S., with roughly 40% in competitive accounts. We continue to update robots in the field with the Total Knee application, which now exceeds 50% of the roughly 385 robots installed in the U.S.", "Surgeon training on the Total Knee application is ongoing with approximately 600 trained through the third quarter, enabling 9,400 Mako Total Knee surgeries since launch.", "For the quarter, TKA procedures on the Mako increased approximately 50% from Q2 to approximately 4,500. And it's worth noting that total robot utilization rates continue to climb, increasing roughly 50% compared to the third quarter of the prior year.", "During Q3, we received 510(k) clearance for our cementless product offering to be used with the Mako Total Knee application. With approximately 20% of our total knees now being performed with our cementless offering, it's clear that there's strong surgeon interest since we first launched the product over three years ago.", "On the clinical front, we are building our database with a number of trials ongoing. At the upcoming (5:41) meeting in November, there will be a poster presented which focuses on the accuracy of implant sizing using Mako for total knees, with the authors concluding that Mako may reduce operative time, improve OR efficiency by reducing the need for instrumentation and potentially decrease revisions.", "And in October, we had our first published article on the short-term outcomes with the Mako Total Knee in the Journal of Knee Surgery. The study compared patients undergoing traditional open knee surgery with Stryker's Triathlon Knee versus Mako Total Knee surgery with Triathlon.", "Outcomes were measured at six months and included pain scores, physical function scores and total patient satisfaction, with all three measurements comparing statistically significantly better for patients undergoing total knee with Mako.", "We remain committed to continuing to invest in clinical studies and believe we are well-positioned with Mako to achieve our goal of driving meaningful market share gains. We believe this is underscored by the fact that our Total Knee sales in customers with the Mako robot are growing at approximately 4 times the rate of our non-Mako customers.", "With respect to NOVADAQ, in September, we completed the acquisition for a net purchase price of $674 million. NOVADAQ is a leading developer of SPY fluorescence imaging technology that provides surgeons with visualization of blood flow and perfusion with over 250 clinical studies and array of specialties.", "The company's product portfolio is highly complementary to Stryker's visualization platform, augmenting our advanced imaging offering in MIS and expanding our presence into open surgery applications such as plastic reconstructive surgery.", "Since completing the deal in early September, we have integrated the teams, inclusive of a large cross-training on the products, education led by KOLs and subject matter experts, and hands-on training sessions for our combined sales force.", "We also finalized our 2018 sales structure. We are actively identifying portfolio synergies and collaborating amongst the sales team on combined quotes to our customers, as they look to standardize to this full advanced imaging portfolio.", "Beyond the sales force, NOVADAQ has an extensive clinical research team and impressive R&D team. We are excited about the long-term opportunities to advance the visualization market. As Glenn will discuss in more detail, we remain on track with our financial target with NOVADAQ expected to be neutral to 2018 earnings and accretive thereafter.", "Lastly, earlier this week, we announced plans to acquire VEXIM, which specializes in the development and sale of vertebral compression fracture solutions for \u20ac183 million. VEXIM's flagship product is the SpineJack system, a mechanical expandable VCF implant for fracture reduction and stabilization.", "The company's portfolio is highly complementary to the interventional spine business of Stryker's Instruments division whose key products include an extensive and innovative portfolio for vertebral augmentation, vertebroplasty and radiofrequency ablation procedures, along with a diagnostic tool and decompression treatment advances for contained disc herniations.", "VEXIM had sales of \u20ac18.5 million in 2016, which was an increase of 33% over the prior year. The company's 510(k) clinical trial for the SpineJack system is progressing, and we anticipate filing for approval in 2018.", "And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Glenn.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Thanks, Katherine. My comments today will be focused on our third quarter financial results and the related performance drivers. The detailed financial data and results have been included in today's press release.", "Organic sales growth for the quarter was 5.5%. As a reminder, this quarter included one less selling day, reducing growth by roughly 1%. As we've previously stated, selling days generally do not have an impact on the performance of our capital businesses.", "Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1% from the prior year, while foreign currency had a favorable 0.3% impact on sales. During the quarter, our sales were negatively impacted by the Sage product action and the hurricanes that interrupted business in Texas and Florida. These events negatively impacted our overall organic sales growth by 240 basis points.", "In the U.S., we continue to see good momentum with organic sales growth of 5.6%, which was evident within Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology segments. Our U.S. organic sales were negatively impacted by the aforementioned Sage product action and weather-related matters by 320 basis points.", "Our international organic sales growth of 5.2% was highlighted by solid performances in Europe, Asia and Latin America. All geographies were impacted by one less selling day.", "Our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share of $1.52 increased 9.4% from the prior year, reflecting strong sales volumes and some favorability in our effective tax rate. Our third quarter EPS, as anticipated, was not significantly impacted by foreign currency exchange rates.", "Taking into account the Sage product actions, the impact of weather and NOVADAQ, we estimate that our adjusted quarterly earnings per diluted share was negatively impacted by $0.05 per share.", "Now I will provide some highlights around our segment performance. Orthopaedics delivered constant currency growth of 4.8% and organic growth of 4.5%, including U.S. organic growth of 6.1%. Adjusting for weather-related disruptions in the quarter, our U.S. Orthopaedic business had organic growth of 6.7%.", "We experienced a number of canceled hip and knee procedures in Houston and more significantly in Florida as a result of the hurricanes. We anticipate many of these cases will be rescheduled in the coming months, but cannot predict scheduling availability during Q4.", "Our U.S. performance was highlighted by growth in Knees of 4.3% and Trauma and Extremities at 9.9%. These growth rates include the impact of weather-related disruptions. We continue to see strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio, our Triathlon knee and our Mako robotics platform.", "Orthopaedics international delivered organic growth of 1.2% and included steady performances across all developed markets.", "MedSurg continued to have strong results in the quarter with constant currency growth of 6.2% and organic growth of 5.6%, which included a 5.3% increase in the U.S. Adjusting for the Sage-related product actions and weather-related disruptions in the quarter, our U.S. MedSurg group had organic growth of 11.6%.", "Our Instruments business had U.S. organic sales growth of 6.4%. This growth is highlighted by continued ramping of our Power Tools business, including our newly launched System 8, as well as good performances of our Sterishield and waste management products.", "Our Endoscopy business had another strong quarter, with U.S. organic sales growth of 11.8%. This reflects continued strong demand not only for our 1588 video platform, but also booms and lights and sports medicine implants.", "During the quarter, Endoscopy completed its acquisition of NOVADAQ Technologies, Inc. Including this acquisition, U.S. Endoscopy sales growth during the quarter was 13.8%.", "Our Medical business had U.S. organic sales decline of 1%. This reflects the impact of the previously discussed Sage product action, which is in line with our previous Q3 Sage disclosure, as well as a nominal impact related to weather matters.", "Adjusted for these matters, Medical's U.S. organic sales growth was 15.4%. This growth primarily reflects underlying strong U.S. growth across Medical's acute care, EMS and Physio businesses, which include continued robustness in our core structure and power cot products.", "Internationally, MedSurg had organic sales growth of 7.1%, which reflects strong growth in our Medical businesses, primarily in Europe.", "Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency and organic growth of 7%. We continue to see strong global demand for our Neurotech products, which is somewhat offset by softness in our spine business. Our U.S. Neurotech business posted growth of 11.8% for the quarter, highlighted by strong demand for our hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke products, CMF products and our neuro-powered instruments.", "Our U.S. spine business continued to see softness across many product areas, which is partially offset by high demand for our 3D-printed Tritanium products. Internationally, Neurotechnology and Spine had organic growth of 10.7%. This performance was driven by strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and Asia.", "Now we'll focus on operating highlights for the third quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66% was down 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter, reflecting an unfavorable mix, price declines and the impact from the disruption to our manufacturing facility in Puerto Rico because of Hurricane Maria.", "We continue to invest in innovation with R&D spending of 6.6% of sales.", "Our adjusted SG&A was 35.2% of sales, which was up 30 basis points from the prior-year quarter. This also reflects some negative impacts from our Sage product actions, weather-related matters and the impact related to the consolidation of our NOVADAQ acquisition during the quarter.", "Additionally, we continue to invest in our CTG program, including our ERP implementation, and in our Mako TKA platform. In total, adjusted operating expenses were 41.8% of sales, which is up 40 basis points compared to the prior-year quarter.", "In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 24.2% of sales and down 70 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The impact from Sage, weather-related matters and NOVADAQ on our adjusted operating margin was approximately 75 basis points.", "As it relates to our full-year operating margin expectation, excluding the impact of the one-time items related to Sage, weather and NOVADAQ, we continue to anticipate delivering 30 to 50 basis points improvement.", "Lastly, I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other income and expense decreased from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to increased interest income.", "Our third quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 14.6% reflects a larger-than-anticipated benefit related to the adoption of the changes in accounting for stock compensation expenses as well as benefits in geographic income mix.", "In the fourth quarter, our tax rate will benefit from certain other geographical and operational changes that, combined with the aforementioned change in accounting, will result in an anticipated full-year effective tax rate in the range of 15.5% to 16%.", "Focusing on the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong position with $2.7 billion of cash and marketable securities, of which approximately 80% was held outside the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the quarter was $7.2 billion.", "Turning to cash flow, our cash from operations was approximately $880 million year-to-date. This includes year-to-date recall-related payments of $492 million.", "And now I will discuss our third quarter and full-year guidance. Based on our past performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, we anticipate full-year organic sales growth to be in the range of 6.5% to 7%. As a reminder, the fourth quarter will have the same amount of selling days as 2016. The full year has one less selling day.", "If foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we expect net sales in the fourth quarter will be impacted positively by 1% and the full year to be nominally impacted. We expect a negative impact on adjusted net earnings per diluted share in the fourth quarter of approximately $0.02 per share and $0.10 in the full year.", "With respect to the outlook, recall that in August when we announced the Sage recall, we revised our 2017 EPS outlook to come in at the low end of our $6.45 to $6.55 range, which excluded the anticipated $0.03 to $0.05 of dilution related to the planned acquisition of NOVADAQ.", "Based on our strong year-to-date results, we now expect our adjusted net earnings per diluted share, including $0.05 of dilution related to NOVADAQ, as well as the impacts related to Sage product actions and weather disruptions to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.50 per share.", "And now we'll open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon. Kevin, I want to talk about, obviously, growth for a second here. I think, even if you adjust out the weather impact, your growth still represents perhaps 8% organic, which is the best number, I think, we've seen in years.", "So I wonder if you can just share some broad commentary. I know MedSurg was strong this quarter. And I know you're not going to give guidance for 2018. But just thinking about broad strokes into next year, could you just touch briefly on where you see improving momentum in the next year and where you see some sustained growth across some of your key franchises? Then I'd have a quick follow-up for Glenn.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So, thanks, David. We're very pleased with the underlying business, even if you look at the Medical division, which obviously had the Sage impact. The other businesses had very strong double-digit growth, whether it was Physio-Control or our core legacy Medical business.", "We had strength in Neurotechnology, strength in Trauma and Extremities, really strength in a number of areas. And we feel very good about our business momentum, our new product cycle. As you know, it varies by division. I'm not going to go through every single division, but I would say you should expect us to continue to deliver sales growth at the high end of med tech going forward.", "David Ryan Lewis - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And maybe just there two follow-ups, I'll merge them together here. Just to follow-up on growth is, as you think about growth in Orthopaedics next year, I wonder if you can share with us how much momentum is coming from the Mako halo, the cementless piece versus competitive disruption, and how important Mako cementless knee is for next year?", "And then for Glenn, just thinking about some of the headwinds to earnings this year, Glenn, Sage, NOVADAQ, FX headwinds, if I think about how those go next year, NOVADAQ should be accretive, Sage obviously gets accretive and no longer dilutive, and FX may move to a slight positive versus negative. Should we think about that as somewhat of a $0.15-plus swing into 2018? And I'll jump back in queue. Thank you.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I'll take the Mako question. I would say we continue to see the bulk of the benefit is from the halo effect. It's getting into competitive accounts, which is about 40% of our robot installations. Selling the whole portfolio, typically, the first thing they do once they have the robot is start using our Triathlon implants for traditional surgery to start to get used to it.", "We've had tremendous success. After a very conservative limited release of our UNI, we've had tremendous success over the past three-plus years. It's 20% of the mix. It was low-singles to start. And we believe that will continue to climb for a number of quarters.", "And the Mako procedure volumes are ramping. Utilization rates are ramping. So it's, obviously, becoming more material, but I wouldn't say it's the key driver of our results with respect to Mako. But it obviously has an impact, as I mentioned, in the Mako accounts. We're growing our Total Knee portfolio in the U.S. about four times faster than that comparable portfolio in non-Mako accounts.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "David, as you think about op margin, and we're not giving guidance for 2018, but I can comment that, yes, NOVADAQ was $0.05 dilutive and will be this year. And we're assuming that it will have no effect in next year. So it'll essentially be flat for next year. So, that's a little bit of a tailwind.", "As it relates to Sage, Sage will continue to ramp, but it's not going to immediately reach its previous sales levels to where we'll feel a one-for-one impact relative to our operating margin. And then, as we mentioned, the weather goes away and we're anticipating that hopefully we'll be able to make most of that up in Q4 anyways.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. You may proceed.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on an outstanding quarter. There's a lot of moving pieces this quarter. So I thought for my questions I just want to clarify a couple of things.", "First of all, in terms of just the organic revenue growth of the company, I mean, my math ex-hurricanes, Sage and selling days, gets you to 8.9%, just shy of 9% growth. So I guess my first question is, is that accurate when I just add up all these numbers that you're close to 8.9% this quarter?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Bob, organic growth of 5.5%, Sage and hurricanes of 2.4%, takes you to 7.9%. And then if you estimated a 1% impact relative to one less selling day, you get to 8.9%.", "Robert Hopkins - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's quite the number. So, just \u2013 second question is just clarifying again on two things. Can we do the same exercise on knee growth? Because that's obviously something that people are really focused on. So knee growth constant currency was 3.9%. I would imagine the selling day impact was like more \u2013 it was more like 1.5% for knees and then maybe 60 basis points for weather. So, was kind of adjusted knee growth closer to 6% than the 3.9% we see?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Your math is right. Selling days really don't have an impact on our capital businesses, which is around 20%. It has a more pronounced impact on recon and some of the Trauma business to about 150 basis points. And then knees were probably impacted somewhere around 70 bps from the hurricane. So you need to adjust for those factors.", "We're not seeing anything when we look in the quarter or at our rolling four-quarter trends with our knee business to suggest anything has changed. We believe we're taking market share. We need to obviously see everybody else's results. Q3, as you know, is the seasonally weakest and tends to be the noisiest of quarters, but underlying growth seems very stable.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks, everybody. And let me just pick up on Bob's question just on the knee business. So, if we try and adjust for everything, which is hard to do this quarter, and with the knee business, it's not an easy comp. But the year-over-year growth in the U.S. is 4.3% on a reported basis here this quarter.", "Let's say it's 6% or 6%-plus adjusting for the noise in the quarter of selling day and weather and so forth. Are you surprised that that's not a little bit higher given the success you're having with Mako? And does it indicate that a lot of the early Mako volume is from existing users? And I'm trying to separate volume from the comment on Mako purchases. So, just trying to tease out all the progress in Mako this quarter relative to the year-over-year growth in U.S. knees?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Thanks, Mike. We're not seeing that. We're looking at a number of different metrics, whether it's surgeons trained, the pace of their training, the utilization rates which up 50% year-over-year; they also continue to increase each quarter this year and the number of surgeries being done.", "So I think, at the end of the day, we have to obviously wait and see everybody's numbers. And you're right, there's a lot of noise and moving parts. Could this be an incrementally weaker knee quarter or hip quarter than prior quarter? It's possible. These numbers move around quarter-to-quarter. But nothing we're seeing or hearing from our customers in the field suggests to us that there's any underlying change in market dynamics.", "So, to the degree that the numbers add up and it looks sequentially a bit slower, if that's the case, I just put it into quarterly noise as opposed to something else. And just like if Q4 comes in seasonally strong as it typically does, I don't think that's anything other than what's traditionally a really strong fourth quarter in hips and knees.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Mike, I'd just add we feel very good about our knee business and we're excited about getting the cementless approval so that we can market that with Mako as well, because I believe the combination of robotics and 3D printing will be very powerful going forward.", "Michael Weinstein - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Understood. Let me just do a couple of quick follow-ups. Katherine, Sage was a $50 million lost sales number this quarter. What are you assuming in your fourth quarter guide for kind of the Sage still headwind that you have in front of you?", "And then second, Neurovascular continues to do exceptionally well. The data points we picked up over the course of the quarter just kind of suggesting that the whole shift of endovascular therapy for ischemic stroke had picked up some steam in the last six months. Is that consistent? Are you picking that up at all? Is that what's driving the business? Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Sure. So, on Sage, probably looking at about $55 million-ish in lost revenue in the third quarter and we think it's going to be a little south of that, maybe in the $45 million vicinity in the fourth quarter, but we really also have to see how we're doing.", "We have work to do to win back customers. We really annoyed them with these recalls and shipment issues. But, again, given Sage's leadership position and the strength of that portfolio, we do think we'll win back that business. But that's probably a pretty good approximation.", "And then on the Neurovascular business, we continue to see really strong momentum, both in hemorrhagic and ischemic. Ischemic tends to move around quarter-to-quarter. It's healthy double-digit growth, but it does bounce around. But the increasing clinical data out there that continues to expand is really helping drive that business and some really good execution by our team. So we're really pleased with where the Neurovascular, Neurotechnology business is right now.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. We had also great performance. If you look at our neuro-powered instruments, they also performed very well. But getting back to Neurovascular, it's across the entire portfolio, whether it's hemorrhagic or ischemic, and it's across all geographies. They run themselves as a global business and they are absolutely on fire.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Taylor with Barclays. You may proceed.", "Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. This is actually Ian Mahmud on for Matt. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, we can. Sure.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, we can.", "Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Great. So you mentioned that there was some softness in U.S. spine in your prepared remarks. I'm hoping you could give us your high level view on the spine market, essentially, what your team is seeing in the field and just your take on overall market strength for the quarter.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. I think it's pretty clear based on all the results today that the spine market continues to be challenged, and ours were no exception. There's pricing pressure. We've got about 30% of the market that's either physician-owned or PODs or private, so it's a little hard to gauge the market.", "But it's a challenging market right now for us and for others. We are doing well in our IVS, our Interventional Spine business as they're putting up some good growth. But the traditional spine business continued to be challenged, and we're not assuming any big recovery near term.", "Ian Mahmud - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And just as a follow-up, do you think you're gaining share or losing share? Is there movement in terms of on the rep side?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I think we're probably pretty much in line with the market, give or take. I don't think there's a discernible trend one way or the other.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Hi, Bruce.", "Matthew Keeler - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Hey. Sorry. I was on mute. This is Matt in for Bruce. Can you hear me okay?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, we can.", "Matthew Keeler - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Just, first of all, on the updated guidance, just wondered if you can give us some more color on \u2013 from a revenue perspective, going from the low end of 6.5% to 7% to back to 6.5% to 7%, what kind of changed there? Was it just the strength in the third quarter or was it more the trends that you're seeing in the fourth quarter that caused you to increase those numbers?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. I think a lot of it is \u2013 first of all, gaining more clarity around Sage is very helpful in terms of us formulating where we think the guidance will come out. Closing on NOVADAQ and getting a much closer look at that was also very helpful in just understanding how those will play into our numbers.", "And then the final thing is we know seasonally that Q4 is very, very strong for us and we're coming off a very strong Q3 across a broad swath of all of our businesses. We also see good product momentum, specifically in some of our newer products that have launched, and we expect that to continue.", "So I think all of that gave us the confidence in rolling up the numbers to get to sort of a better look at where our guidance is coming out.", "Matthew Keeler - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up to clarify an earlier comment on the storm impact to sales in the third quarter. You said there was procedures, capital equipment, that you think you lost and the cover in the press release is helpful on how much that was. But I guess you said you didn't expect it to be a material impact in 4Q. And I guess my thought is that some of that would come back there and you might see a material benefit to sales. Why wouldn't that be material?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "It's just not big enough. It's not all going to come back in the fourth quarter. It depends on surgery schedules for the surgeon, for the patients. And so, given the overall magnitude, we think our overall strength of our fourth quarter business we can manage through any procedures. And we expect those to come back, whether or not it's all in Q4 or over the next few quarters, we'll just have to wait and see.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just a follow-up on the guidance. From the bottom-line perspective, now you're embedding in the dilution. What gives you the confidence to kind of go with that range? Is it just the confidence in the top line or anything changed on the dilution with NOVADAQ?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Kristen, there's no real change on the dilution with NOVADAQ. I think, really, just the robustness and strength of the top line that we're expecting, and not only just in Q3, but just what we typically and historically have seen in Q4. And so, that really will allow us to kind of cover some of these things that previously we thought would have a bigger impact.", "Kristen Stewart - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Perfect. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. You may proceed.", "Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Thanks so much for taking the questions. Just to start off with the comment that I think either Katherine or Kevin, you made on the Mako growth that you're seeing from a procedural perspective. I think you said, within those accounts, you're seeing the knee business grow at 4x the other accounts.", "Can you just expand a little bit on that? Is it a function of those customers are attracting just so many more patients that they're growing so much faster? Or is there some other dynamic going on that's driving that type of growth?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I think it's really a combination of the fact that we're putting robots into existing Stryker accounts. And if they're doing procedures on the robot, it has to be done with a Stryker Knee. So, that inherently means we're going to be taking more of that business, replacing about 40% of the robots. And that's been very consistent and competitive accounts, where we either have no market share or it's well below our average. And so, that's all new business.", "And it's not just selling Triathlon to be done on the robot. It's selling the whole portfolio. Our 3D-printed cementless product offering has been incredibly successful. Our 3D-printed revision codes and sleeves, that enables us to capture the revision implant business. So it's really the combined effect that really allows us to increase the revenue we're deriving in Mako accounts versus non-Mako.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "And that story is the same story in Europe. So we're replacing robots also outside United States. We get the same kind of halo effect and overall growth in our knee business.", "Matt O'Brien - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then as the follow-up, your Trauma and Extremities business again this quarter was really strong with a difficult comp. And I think, as I look at my model, this is the best performance that you've seen out of that business on a tiered stack basis in the last couple of years.", "So is there something specifically driving that improvement there? And then how much momentum or juice do you have to continue this level of growth out of that business?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Look, it was a fantastic quarter. And if you recall, going back almost five years, this has been a business that's outperformed the market year-after-year-after-year, quarter-after-quarter. If you go back two or three years, we were regularly posting double-digit growth.", "The last year or so, the comps started to catch up with us, but they put up a terrific quarter. And it was really across the board. If I look at Foot and Ankle had a terrific quarter. Our Shoulder business was very strong and even our core Trauma business. So this is something where we focused, we dedicated sales reps. we made investments, we filled out our product portfolio, and we're bearing a lot of fruit from that.", "So it wouldn't be just one thing I could point to. I think it's just increased momentum that's been building over a number of years, more specialization, more focus. And it's driving really terrific results.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. You may proceed.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Thanks. Glenn, I just want to circle back to your comment on operating margin expansion. If I adjust for the 75-basis-point headwind from one-time items this quarter, it looks to me like you're about flat here through the first nine months of the year. Is that your math as well? And if so, then how do you get to that 30- to 50-basis-point underlying full-year improvement?", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. I think we're actually a little up year-to-date, but you're right, it's maybe close to flat. If you go back and look at Q4, it typically is our strongest sales quarter and also generates the greatest amount of leverage in every single year. We'll expect that that will also happen this year with our sales growth expectations. Also, we're beginning to see some of the benefits from our CTG investments, which I think will contribute to that in Q4.", "And then if I think about excluding those impacts of Sage, weather, NOVADAQ, which are not incidental to the margin, I think we'll be in the range of 30 to 50 basis points for the full year.", "Chris Pasquale - Guggenheim Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, Kevin, emerging markets is a smaller piece of your business than it is for some of your competitors. But just love to hear your updated thoughts on the strategy in the EM and also how you think some of these markets are going to evolve, particularly China, as they institute some new regulations there going forward?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Look, we had a good quarter in emerging markets. It grew at high-single digits, and that's with a bit of negative growth from India. As you know, they had some severe price controls around knee implants which hit us.", "But, overall, emerging markets was a high-single-digit growth. China, for us, is a very important market for the future, even with the impending changes that they're making. We have a very, very low market share, especially in our implant business.", "And we have a new leader for China, who's starting this quarter and we're very excited about, and we're making a lot of changes. China actually is contributing to growth this year after a couple of difficult years of destocking.", "And so we're encouraged. We are very committed to the emerging markets long-term. In spite of some of the temporary challenges related to nationalism and other things, there are going to be big markets, important markets.", "We're going to take a bit of a patient approach. So we're not going to invest huge amounts of money. But we are going to make sure we have the right channel in place and then make the appropriate investments to continue to fuel growth. But it's been growing for us this year, and we had a good quarter again in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. You may proceed.", "Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hey, Kevin. Let me start with Physio-Control. Obviously, you're very early on in some new product cycles, but my sense is haven't fully gotten underway in each segment of the business. Can you help us understand where we are and the potential impact on growth?", "And maybe as part of that, I saw that Philips recently suspended U.S. defibrillator production. Is that something you're positioned to take advantage of and could be helpful?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Sure. Hi, Rick. Yeah. So, Physio had a terrific quarter and really benefit, a lot of it was in Europe. So their new AED has been launched in Europe. Has not been launched in the U.S. yet, it's pending approval, but has been launched in Europe and it did very, very well in the third quarter.", "We also have our new CPR-assist device, the LUCAS 3, which has been launched globally. And that's performing very well. But we haven't yet launched a new manual defibrillator. So I would say we're sort of early in the new product cycle, but that business has performed very well in the third quarter.", "And as it relates to Philips, look, this is certainly going to benefit all the other players in the market. But it's capital purchase, so it's not something that \u2013 I think you look at something like Sage, which is a disposable. They need to use those every single day. You can't defer those procedures. So, that market share would shift much more quickly than a capital business. But we do stand to benefit along with other large players in the market.", "Frederick Wise - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "And just as a follow-up on Mako, one more from me. I'd be curious to hear just was the quarter on the system side ahead of what you might have expected, Kevin? And if it was, maybe talk about your experience so far? I mean, if it was ahead of plan, what have you learned in terms of the launch and how people are deciding? And I mean, related to capital availability or decision making, is it happening faster than you might have thought despite the need to upgrade? Just, again, any color would be welcome. Thank you.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Thanks, Rick. Look, we've been very pleased all year with the performance of Mako. And the third quarter was no exception. We've done a terrific job of hiring our Makoplasty specialists, of doing knee upgrades as well as selling new capital.", "It's a tricky challenge that was put on our team. Demand continues to be very strong. We don't have any manufacturing capacity issues. The real issue is getting surgeons trained. But I would say, every quarter, they performed extremely well. And we have a good pipeline. I expect this momentum to continue.", "And as you've seen, the buzz about robotics, the story has completely changed. And now no one is doubting whether robotics are here to stay. It's only a question of which robot and when do we get on the board with robotics. And that's a seachange versus even a-year-and-a-half or two years ago. So I think the tailwind of people seeing the value of this. And as we start to publish clinically, as Katherine alluded to in her prepared remarks, I think that's only going to fuel the fire.", "So, very bullish about the future, and the team continues to execute extremely well. But there's no new dynamic. I would say this is \u2013 disruptive technologies take a little while to take hold, as you've seen in other parts of healthcare. And this is one that's really starting to take hold now.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. First question on Sage. Kevin, I heard you say earlier that you expect to recapture share of the coming quarters. I guess could you be a little bit more specific when you think you can get back to the pre-recall run rate? And I had one follow-up.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. I think we're pretty early. We just resumed shipping all products, which we're really pleased with, and that just started in September. And so I think we're going to have to see how our customers react. We have work to do. Our sales force are focused on that, but it'd be premature to start speculating when it all comes back.", "We do believe we can regain the lost share. I don't believe it's going to happen all in Q4. And then we're just going have to get a little bit more time under our belt and more discussions with our customers.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Just as a guide, and this is not a prediction, right, but just as a guide, if you look at Neptune and how that came back, it took us roughly a year to regain all of our previous business. Now that of course has a capital component. So it's not a perfect analog, but this won't happen in one quarter, it won't happen in two quarters, but I do believe we have a pathway to regain the business.", "I'm very excited with how the team is executing, how they're performing. But we have customers that were upset. We have some customers that have entered into contracts that don't expire in 90 days. And so we have to work to regain the business.", "Lawrence Biegelsen - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "That's helpful. And then I heard your comments earlier about the spine market but not much on your own spine business and the strategy there, and when you expect that business to start turning positive again. So, any color there would be helpful. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. I mean, clearly our core spine business has work to do. We're going to continue to invest in the R&D pipeline and invest in our sales force. But it's a challenging market right now. And I don't want to pretend that we've got good visibility as to when the market or us will be back to growth. So we're assuming it remains challenging and I think we need to see some evidence of momentum returning before we start to speculate on where growth will go.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Miksic with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks for taking our questions and congrats on a terrific quarter, especially, just on the upgrades for Mako. It's impressive to get to 50% penetration at this point in the launch.", "So I had one follow-up on the U.S. knee growth. I know sort of like adding the pluses and headwinds and so on, I just wanted to make sure we get this right. If we look at U.S. growth of 4.3% figure, to Bob's point, 1.5% or something like that, and then given the storm impact was primarily in the U.S., I guess it's closer to 1% impact. Just to make sure I'm looking at this the right way, it seems like that growth would be closer to 7% than 6%. Is that math approximately right?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. I think we'd probably split the difference. We think the \u2013 and again, this isn't perfect science, but we think...", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Sure.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "...the hurricanes impacted our U.S. knee business by about 70 basis points. Selling days typically have a 150-basis-point impact on our joint business. And so, if you add that to that underlying 4.3%, you get something at the midpoint between 6% and 7%, and that's what we think our true organic U.S. knee growth was.", "Matt Miksic - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And then if I could, just sort of a combination follow-up question. One in terms of first time around the horn here with the Mako knee launch and just love to get your sense as to how we should think about the seasonality of capital budgets, et cetera, for systems heading into the fourth quarter?", "And the second part of that, unrelated, you mentioned the SpineJack acquisition. Obviously, interesting interventional addition. But, to Larry's question on spine, is there something more significant in terms of investments going beyond R&D that you feel like you need to do on the kind of the fusion and Regen (47:03) side of the business to sort of reinvigorate growth? Is that on the table? Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. So I'll take the spine one first. We're going to continue to evaluate opportunities that could augment our product portfolio. But right now the focus of the group is really understanding the market dynamics, executing on the products we have.", "We've had great success with things like our 3D-printed cage, but there are supply issues there. And so the team needs to \u2013 really to execute. And as I mentioned, this is a challenging market. So I don't see a magic fix near term. The pending VEXIM deal, that really goes into the IVF business within Instruments where they've actually been seeing some pretty good momentum there.", "And then, in terms of Mako, it's capital. So the robot, the $1 million (47:28); Q4 is typically the strongest capital business across the board, whether it's MedSurg or Ortho. And I don't anticipate anything different. Hospitals are looking to use up their budgets by year-end. We have a Flex Financial Group that can go in and work with them on lease options and the like. So I would assume robots have the typical seasonality that we see with our other capital businesses.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. Just to add on spine, I think we have launched a couple of new products that we're presenting at our NASS conference right now. Tritanium C, which is the great 3D-printed interbody that we've had great success in the lumbar space and the cervical space, which we're very excited about, as well as Serrato which is a new easy-to-insert pedicle screw.", "So, a couple of new products. We obviously have more to do in terms of innovating around our new products. And of course, we'll always, like we do at every division, look for other ways to augment the portfolio.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. So, another question on Mako. I was hoping you could compare-contrast what you're seeing in the U.S. versus Europe with regards to demand, competitive landscape and the types of physicians that are showing interest between the two regions.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "It's really \u2013 the game plan is the same. We look for where there's a surgeon champion to make sure that when the robot is placed, we're going to see utilization ramp, which is what we're seeing. So there really isn't a different strategy in terms of how we identify who the right target is. It varies by geography. Obviously, with 385 in the U. S., the U.S. is our biggest market.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. And I'd just say, in Europe, Europe isn't one country as you know. So there are some very attractive countries and some that are not as attractive. And I'd say the attractive category would be the UK, Germany, Italy. Those are probably the three areas that are most attractive. And some of the other countries will take a little longer. They're going to want to wait to see more data before they start to adopt.", "But we're doing well in Europe. We're starting to pick up momentum. The surgeon interest is the same. And again, as we do more publications, certain countries \u2013 just like we've seen with a place like Canada, some countries are slower to adopt this type of technology than in Australia, which already has a very large number of robots and pretty fast adoption.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great. And then just a follow-up maybe for Glenn on the margin side. If I think about some of the moving parts exiting the year with the M&A and so forth, would you be able to give us, at some point, an update as to what the normalized margin expansion for the business looks like?", "Because I would imagine that some of the deals you're doing here will give you the opportunity to at least hit the higher end of the range versus what you previously articulated. And just trying to get a sense of what the real margin expansion cadence can be as you have a little bit more to work with on efficiency. Thank you.", "Glenn S. Boehnlein - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah, I think going back to when we introduced sort of the cost transformation for growth program we talked about margin expansion over a five-year period of time. That included sort of a range of 30 to 50 basis points of expansion each year and 30 basis points in the earlier year, ramping more to like 50 basis points in the latter year.", "And really, beyond that, I think you can look at sort of what we've historically done in Q4 in operating margins, which is fairly more significant than the first three quarters of a year. And that should give you pretty good guidance. And we'll revisit it at Q4 when we give guidance for 2018.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yes, we can. Sure.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Wonderful. Two quick questions. First of all, could you please give us an update generally what the capital equipment environment is looking like?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. We are not really seeing any changes. Medical, if you look at the numbers I posted for our legacy medical business, that's all capital. That's structures and costs, and we've seen double-digit growth there, double-digit growth for Physio. Q4, as you know, is the seasonally strongest capital quarter. We feel really good about our capital market right now.", "Joanne Karen Wuensch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Excellent. And then because of that and I also so I have to ask this question, how are you thinking about a spying robot?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "I think, as you think about Mako, we believe there's a number of applications beyond the hip and knee joints, but that's really the focus right now. So we do believe that there's going to be opportunities in spine and shoulders and other areas.", "But right now, we are really focused on ensuring that we have a very successful launch of the Total Knee. We only have one chance to get this right. And we feel really pleased with the trajectory around there. But we will also be looking at other applications because we do think there's opportunities outside of hips and knees.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.", "Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Thanks guys for taking the questions. Very strong knee and hips when you take out weather, when you take out the one less selling day. But I wonder if you're also benefiting from the fact that number one player in the market, they are still struggling with their output and production. So I wonder if you can talk a little bit about the competitive environment and how much are you benefiting from just the number one player still struggling. And I had one more follow-up on the Mako.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. It's difficult. We need to wait for Zimmer, Smith & Nephew to report to get a full picture in the quarter. What I can tell you is we believe our strategy is working. Our focus on Mako, targeting competitive accounts, investing in this Mako specialist, investing in our sales force there is driving share gains.", "So, regardless who may be challenged in the market, we're going to stick to this game plan because we do believe it's working well. And we'll get a better sense of how market shares have moved around once everybody has reported.", "Glenn John Novarro - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Yeah. Fair enough. And then the 33 robots that you sold in the quarter, can you remind us what percentage of these are outright sales versus leases?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "The majority are outright sales. We don't break it down between sales and lease. We do offer leasing options through Flex Financials. But even if \u2013 once they're walked through the leasing option, more often than not they tend to purchase. So I'd say the majority are purchases.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. You may proceed.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Thanks, guys, for taking the questions. So, a quick follow-up on spine and then one on Mako. So I know you commented on the spine market, continues to be challenging, and that on your strategy there.", "But I guess, can you just talk a little bit more about how that sort of big-picture concern has impacted or changed your investment strategy going forward, i.e. is it maybe less or more enthusiastic about certain areas within spine? Or has the overall market softness and the need to understand that dynamic sort of negatively impacted your appetite for more heavy investment in that area beyond the VEXIM deal?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So, I would tell you, we're committed to the spine market. We believe it's an important part of Orthopaedics. There's tremendous unmet need and opportunities to continue to innovate like we did with our 3D-printed products. Throughout the years, we inevitably have businesses that are more challenged. Just look at China in more recent years for us.", "We're going to stick to investing in the business. We've got great leadership. And eventually these markets write themselves. It just happens to be a period where spine is particularly challenged. We're big enough, diverse enough and global enough that we can manage through that and still deliver what we believe are exceptional organic growth rates. So it really doesn't change how we think about the business and we really can't pivot like that just based on quarter-to-quarter results.", "Kaila P. Krum - William Blair & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Mako, I know you mentioned Mako utilization rates are moving higher. So, first, can you help us understand if there is much of a variance just across your systems in terms of that utilization growth?", "And then can you also help us parse out through the specific drivers of that? Is it more patient-driven? Is it the clinical work you're doing? And then just what gives you confidence that we can continue to see sequential improvements in that metric going forward?", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So we're early in the launch. We just went into the full launch in March at Academy. I will tell you what we see is where we've got physicians who are interested in new technology, that's where we have the greatest sponsorship, and then it typically can expand into a given practice. We're just in the early stages of the clinical data. Encourage you to take a look at the recent publication in the knee surgery journal.", "We're going to continue to invest in those areas and believe all of that will drive utilization rates. It's pre-mature to think about direct-to-consumer because we need to get more robots out there. But we're going to stick with the same plan; train surgeons, focus where there is a surgeon champion, investing in clinical studies, investing in the Mako sales force and our broader team.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. I'd just like to add that it's really encouraging to see the adoption occurring across the different types of hospitals, so academic teaching hospitals, rural community hospitals, even surgery centers. So, to see Mako appearing across the spectrum is really exciting. And especially the academic centers where initially there was some belief that that might take a little longer, we're seeing really good adoption. So it's really across the board.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen & Company. You may proceed.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Hi. Thanks, and good evening. I just wanted to first start off with a follow-up question on the Mako halo effect and just any updated thoughts on the potential future benefit for the hip franchise as you get deeper into the Mako Total Knee launch. And are there any other catalysts for the USA franchise on the horizon? I think the 3D-printed acetabular cup launch is next year, but just wanted to [Technical Difficulty] (57:46).", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah...", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Sorry. You broke up a little at the end, but go ahead. Go ahead.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "So, on Mako, you were asking in terms of the utilization uptake, and I think we're going to continue to \u2013 we expect that to continue to ramp here. I don't anticipate a real change. We are launching a new 3D-printed acetabular cup.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. We're in limited launch right now. The early surgeon feedback is very strong on the cup. The full launch won't be until probably the middle part. Second or third quarter next year, we'll move into full launch. But so far the feedback is very positive.", "And as you know, we've had a bit of a dry product cycle within hips the last year or two. Prior to that, we had very, very strong market-leading growth in hips when we had the new stems that we launched, including Accolade II. But this is a very modern 3D-printed cup. We're very excited about it. It hasn't started to contribute to growth yet but should be a catalyst in 2018.", "And the halo effect is very powerful. It's not just also in knees. I think it's going to start to extend to other parts. Once you have a Stryker sales rep that has a license to hunt inside an (58:59) account and they start to show you the breadth of our offerings, I think that will extend.", "Right now, obviously we're measuring it as it relates to knee. But getting into places where you've never been is wildly exciting. It opens all kinds of other doors. And that's something we look forward to in the future.", "Joshua Jennings - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Great. And just a follow-up on the Sage remediation efforts. Is there any more major work that's still needed to be done? I mean, you guys are not impacted in terms of getting the product back on the market. But any color in terms of incremental costs and where you are in that remediation process would be helpful. Thanks.", "Katherine A. Owen - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. So we expect to be at full availability of our product portfolio by the end of the fourth quarter, which is consistent with what we've stated in August when we first announced it.", "We have a lot of work to do with our customers as we touched on. So, as we mentioned, we disrupted them and inconvenienced them and made it really challenging for products that they use every day. So we have to work to win them back.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "And it's been a massive undertaking. We had to expand our test lab facilities pretty significantly. And we have to ramp production. So we have to make all of the SKUs across all the product families and restock the pipeline and that just takes time.", "But I'm very excited that every product family we are shipping, we have no more sort of other gating factors, other than just scaling the manufacturing and filling up the supply chain.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. You may procced.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon. I'll ask one on Mako as well. I'm just curious, as you're starting to get a broader utilization of the robot now, what you're seeing in terms of treatment times? Have you seen treatment times coming down to where they're starting to be time-neutral or does it still take longer on the robot?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "It really depends on the surgeon. There are a number of surgeons that are faster on the robot. I would say the average of surgeons are slightly slower. But time is not a barrier.", "So, even for the surgeons who are a little bit slower on the robot, the feedback we get from them is that I liked having a little extra time to make decisions that I could never make before because I can have inter-operative feedback, dynamic feedback through the full range of motion prior to making cuts and I want to be able to make different decisions that I could never make before.", "So we were very careful. We took a whole year, if you recall, prior to the full launch to make sure that time wasn't going to be the barrier. And at this stage of the launch, we have enough surgeons trained, enough surgeons doing procedures for us to be able to say, look, time is not the barrier. And as I mentioned, in some cases, some surgeons are actually faster with the robot.", "So it really is more surgeon-dependent. And of course, the staff, you have to train the surgical service staff. There is a change in management that occurs and that's why I feel ramping up this technology doesn't happen overnight as it requires a lot of change management on behalf of the surgeon as well as the surgical staff. And that's what our team has spent a lot of time doing in their training to make sure that it's successful.", "Raj Denhoy - Jefferies LLC", "No, it's great. And you mentioned also that you're seeing adoption in ambulatory surgery centers. And it's kind of a broader question about your thoughts on knees moving to the outpatient setting and in alternative settings for procedures getting done. And just really do you have any broad thoughts around what that could do to the business for you?", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "Yeah. So, look, there's a lot of noise about it. It's still a very small part of the overall procedures that are done in surgery centers. I do think it's a trend that will continue going forward. And I think we'll be well-positioned to compete in the surgery centers as we are in the hospitals.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would now turn the call back to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin A. Lobo - Stryker Corp.", "So, thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the fourth quarter 2017 results will be held on January 30, 2018. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

My name is Sandra and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Following the conference, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. During that time, participants will have the opportunity to ask one question and one follow-up question. [Operator Instructions] This conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.", "Before we begin, I would like to remind you that the discussions during this conference call will include forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in the company's most recent filings with the SEC. Also, the discussions will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in today's press release that is an exhibit to Stryker's current report on Form 8-K filed today with the SEC.", "I will now turn the call over to Mr. Kevin Lobo, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. You may proceed, sir.", "Kevin Lobo", "Welcome to Stryker's fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Glenn Boehnlein, Stryker's CFO; and Katherine Owen, VP of Strategy and Investor Relations.", "For today's call, I'll provide opening comments followed by Katherine, with an update on Mako. Glenn will then provide additional details regarding our quarterly results, before we open the call to Q&A.", "2017 was another strong year for Stryker, including an impressive Q4 organic sales growth of 8.1%. And we again face tough year-over-year comparisons in Q4 across all three groups, Orthopaedics, MedSurg and Neurotechnology and Spine, underscoring the strength of our diversified revenue model.", "Growth was also balanced geographically with the U.S. posting organic gains of 8.6%, while OUS was up 6.7%. Within international growth was consistent across regions and Europe posted high single-digit gains for the third consecutive year, since we implemented the Transatlantic Operating Model.", "There were numerous standout above market performances in the quarter, which Glenn will cover in his section. For the full year despite Sage product supply issues, three major hurricanes and one less selling day, organic sales growth topped 7% exceeding our raised guidance of 6.5% to 7%.", "Both our Q4 and full year results reflect excellent sales and marketing execution coupled with value added innovation delivered by R&D and acquisitions. And through the tremendous effort of our global quality and operations team, we ensured continued product supply following the hurricanes as well as meeting our targets to return Sage products to the market. We continue to make strong progress with our cost transformation for growth initiatives which are yielding tangible results that will sustain ongoing operating margin expansion.", "Adjusted per share earnings claim 10.1% to a $1.96 for Q4 and we are up nearly 12% to $6.49 for the full year topping our targeted range of 635 to 645 established at the start of 2017. As you look ahead to 2018, we expect our top-line momentum to continue and target organic sales growth of 6% to 6.5% for the full year, which we believe will once again be at the high end of med tech.", "Our outlook reflects robust product cycles across our divisions, continued strong sales and marketing execution and the benefit from acquisitions that are the past one year mark. The recent U.S. tax reform legislation and acquisition dilution will create headwinds for us in 2018, but with our strong top-line and operating margin expansion we are targeting full year adjusted per share earnings of $7.07 to $7.17.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Katherine.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Kevin. My comments today will focus on Mako, noted in our prerelease earlier this month momentum continued with Q4 Mako robot installations totaling 35 globally with 27 in the U.S. And in Q4 we had our first robot sale in Japan with approval for the Total Knee application expected by year end.", "We are also pleased that upgrades of existing robots in the field to the Total Knee application are pacing ahead of plan. Upgrades of our existing customers with the big focus in Q4 which does take considerable time from our capital sales force to close. We expect continued new robot installation as well as completing upgrade of the majority of robots in the U.S. during 2018.", "Since launch of the Total Knee application we have trained over 800 surgeons including roughly 200 in the fourth quarter. Mako Total Knee procedures for 2017 were 15,778 of which nearly 20% more with competitive surgeons who are using our Triathlon Total Knee implant for the first time.", "We continue to see approximately 40% of our robots installed in competitive accounts where we have well below average or no market share. We are clearly seeing the pull through spectrum accounts with Mako as our U.S. primary knee sales in Mako Total Knee accounts grew at 5 times the rate of accounts without the Mako Total Knee application. For all Mako applications, procedures in 2017 topped 42,500 versus 22,000 the prior year with all three applications growing.", "Mako utilization rates also continued to climb increasing over 40% year-over-year in the fourth quarter for all Mako procedures and up roughly 30% sequentially fueled by Total Knee. We exited the year with Mako robots in 372 U.S. hospitals which represents about 10% of our customer base. We remain very encouraged by the strong customers\u2019 feedback which we anticipate will be evident at the upcoming AAOF meeting in March and subsequent surgeon meetings throughout the year.", "During 2017 we sold robots into a number of top tier academic hospitals where many of the industry key opinion leaders are camping the technology. This is enabling competitive conversions driven by surgeons focused on improved clinical outcomes achievable with the Mako total needs.", "Looking ahead to 2018, we believe we are well positioned to continue to drive Mako momentum including double digit year-over-year growth in new robot installations, completion of the upgrades of existing robots in the U.S., expansion OUS and further evidence of the improved clinical outcomes with the Mako Total Knee at both AAOS and later in 2017 at AAHKS.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Glenn.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Thanks Katherine. Today I will provide comments on our fourth quarter financial results and related performance drivers. Our detailed financial results have been provided in today\u2019s press release. Our organic sales growth was 8.1% in the quarter included no difference in selling days. This resulted in full year organic growth of 7.1% which is slightly above the high end of our target growth range of 6.5% to 7%.", "Pricing in the quarter was unfavorable 1% from the prior year, while foreign currency exchange had a 1.2% favorable impact on sales. For the quarter, U.S. sales continued to demonstrate strong momentum with organic growth of 8.6% reflecting solid performances across our portfolio. International sales grew 6.7% organically, which was balanced across our international regions.", "Our adjusted quarterly EPS of $1.96 increased 10.1% from the prior year quarter, reflecting strong sales growth and good operating expense control. Foreign currency including the impact of our hedging program had a nominal positive impact on fourth quarter EPS.", "Focusing on our segment highlights for the quarter, Orthopaedics delivered constant currency in organic growth of 6.8% led by the U.S. with organic growth of 8.1%. These gains reflect continued momentum in the U.S. trauma and extremities at 11.5% and knees at 10.5%, underlying this growth with strong demand for our 3D-printed products, our Foot and Ankle portfolio and our Mako platform.", "Orthopaedics international delivered constant currency in organic growth of 4.1% led by our European businesses partially offset by our performance in Asia.", "MedSurg posted strong gains across all our businesses in the quarter with constant currency growth of 9.8% and organic growth of 8.5%, which included a 9.3% increase in the U.S. Instruments, grew U.S. sales 13.5% organically including robust growth from our Power Tools and Sterishield products.", "Endoscopy delivered U.S. organic growth of 8.3% underscoring the strength of this product portfolio which includes the highly successfully 1588 and camera platform as well as its ProCare service support and sports medicine businesses.", "Medical had U.S. organic growth of 6.3% despite a $30 million loss in Sage product sales. This growth was driven by its core bed and power cot products, as well as strong accretive growth from Medical\u2019s Physio business.", "During the quarter, Medical\u2019s Sage business returned to market with all of its product families. We are seeing a positive response from our customers and remain focus on regaining loss market share as we move through 2018.", "Internationally MedSurg had constant currency growth of 6.7% and organic sales growth of 5.7%, which reflects solid performances in Europe and Australia.", "Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 10.3% and organic growth of 10%. This growth reflects continued strong demand for our Neurotech products. U.S. Neurotech posted organic growth of 12.9% in the quarter highlighted by continued strong demand for our neurovascular products including our Target coil and AIS products as well as our CMF products in our neuropowered instruments.", "Our Spine business in the U.S. posted positive growth bolstered by continued demand for our IVS and 3D-printed interbody Tritanium products. The core spinal market continues to be challenged and is softened throughout 2017.", "Internationally Neurotechnology and Spine had constant currency growth of 15.6% and organic growth of 14.5%. This performance was driven by continued strong demand for our Neurotech products in Europe and in Asia.", "Now I will focus on operating highlights in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted gross margin of 66.4% was in line with the prior year quarter. Gross margin was negatively impacted by absorption and productivity issues associated with the continued recovery of our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility, as well as unfavorable pricing and mix including the impact of acquisitions.", "During the quarter, we continued to invest in our internal innovation with R&D spending totaling 5.9% of the sales and full year totaling 6.3%. Our SG&A of 33.5% of sales was 90 basis points unfavorable to the prior year quarter. This reflects unfavorable leverage from our recent acquisition business mix including the impact related to our recent NOVADAQ acquisition and sales losses resulting from Sage product actions.", "Additionally, we have continued to make investments in our ongoing ERP initiative and certain sales growth initiatives, primarily Mako TKA, which were partially offset by favorable leverage from continued focus on operating expense improvements through our CTG program and other cost containment efforts.", "In total adjusted operating expenses were 39.4% of sales in the quarter, which was 80 basis points unfavorable to the prior year quarter. In summary, our adjusted operating margin was 27% of sales down 70 basis points from the prior year quarter.", "Our full year operating margin was down 30 basis points from the prior year. Adjusting full year operating margin for issues related to Puerto Rico and Sage and excluding dilution from NOVADAQ, our operating margin delivered over 30 basis points of improvement.", "Lastly I will provide some highlights on other income and expense. Other expenses decreased from prior year quarter due primarily due reduced net interest expense and increased investment income.", "Our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate of 16.1% reflects the benefits from our global tax structure partially offset by the impact of higher U.S. based income from our recent acquisitions. On December 22, 2017 the tax cut and job acts, the act was signing the law by the President, which provided for multiple changes in the current tax regulations.", "Most noticeably it included a reduction in U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, a current tax on previously deferred foreign earnings and profits and an ongoing tax related to certain returns related to asset sales and controlled foreign corporations. Related to these changes we reported an unfavorable adjustment to our U.S. deferred tax assets of $38 million reflecting the impact of the federal income tax rate change on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017.", "Additionally, a liability of approximately $785 million was recorded related to future tax payments on previously deferred foreign earnings and profits. Both of these adjustments have been reflected in our reconciliation of non-GAAP earnings.", "Moving on to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet with $2.8 billion of cash and marketable securities of which approximately 62% was held outside of the U.S. Total debt on the balance sheet at the end of the year was $7.2 billion.", "Turning to cash flow, our full year cash from operations was approximately $1.6 billion during 2017 we repurchased approximately 230 million of shares. And now I will provide our 2018 guidance.", "Based on our momentum from 2017 and assessment of the current economic and market conditions we expect organic sales growth to be in the range of 6% to 6.5% for 2018. There are the same number of selling days in 2018 as in 2017, however as you update your quarterly models please note that Q1 has one less selling day, Q2 has one more selling day and while both Q3 and Q4 have the same number of days.", "The foreign currency exchange rates hold near current levels, we anticipate sales will be favorable impacted by approximately 1% in 2018. We also expect continued unfavorable price reductions of 1% to 1.5% fairly consistent with the pricing environment experienced in 2017.", "In addition, we expect our CTG program and other cost containment measures to add 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin in 2018. We also anticipate that investment spending on CTG programs and ERP will continue to be at the same levels as 2017.", "As the new tax act relates to our 2018 effective tax rate, we anticipate that it will be a modest increase. The modifications to the internal revenue code include a much lower base U.S. federal corporate tax rate and a move to a more territorial system for corporations that have overseas earnings.", "However, certain provisions relates to the taxation of income streams from foreign subsidiaries are expected to have a negative impact on our effective tax rate more than offsetting the benefit related to U.S. rate reduction. As such we expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate in 2018 will be in the range of 16.5% to 17.5%.", "Capital expenditures are expected to be $550 million to $600 million in 2018 as we continue to invest in our operations and IT infrastructure including year two of our worldwide ERP implementation to support future growth and operational efficiencies. This level compares to approximately $600 million of capital expenditures in 2017.", "At this time, we anticipate share buybacks of $300 million to essentially offset dilution in 2018. The foreign currency exchange rates remain at current levels and when considered along with our hedging program we expect modest favorability and net earnings per diluted share for the full year and first quarter.", "Finally, for 2018 we expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $7.07 to $7.17 for the full year, including approximately $1.57 to $1.62 in the first quarter. Our guidance includes the aforementioned impact from the new tax act and foreign exchange as well as previously announced acquisition dilution including Intelius which is expected to close in Q1 with full year dilution estimated to be $0.04.", "And now I will open up the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Lewis with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "David Lewis", "Good afternoon. Just a few questions, Kevin I want to start with knee performance, if we think about as Stryker gain momentum in the fourth quarter its perhaps the widest as ever been, relative to peers, so why don\u2019t you talk about the primary factors and you\u2019ve discussed, as a Mako component, cementless as a component and competitive disruption. But how do you see the mix of those factors in the fourth quarter and how should investors think about, that momentum in 2018 and the factors driving that momentum in 2018? I had a follow-ups.", "Kevin Lobo", "Sure thanks David. We are obviously delighted with our knee performance. Mako in general was a terrific performance for the year both in capital as well as upgrades, getting the Total Knees upgraded was a big factor. I would say that Mako was the biggest contributor to our outperformance, cementless of course continues to grow. We exited 2017 with 24% of our knees done cementless, pretty significant number we are only able to start promoting cementless with Mako in the fourth quarter, but it\u2019s clearly some certain we\u2019re able to do that even prior to the official approval.", "Those are the two biggest factors, clearly there is and ahead of disruption that\u2019s occurring, but the degree of separation you heard Katherine talk about the number of certain change the momentum, the procedural growth with Mako, we are now in this mood were Mako is the biggest contributor to the growth. We\u2019re very excited and bullish about the prospects for the future and you would recall a few years ago, we said that after we do the full launch of the Total Knee we expected to gain 100s of basis points of market share and clearly this is only one quarter, but it\u2019s a terrific quarter.", "David Lewis", "Okay very clear. And then Glenn, just a kind of a two part question for you, one I just, can you help us little bit with the earnings bridge for 2018 specifically components I mentioned in our FX, NOVADAQ, Sage and you gave us Intelius, but FX, NOVADAQ and Sage and then sort of related to that, if I think about the fourth quarter, you typically see about 250 basis points of margin improvement into the fourth quarter, if I adjust the third quarter for this one-time events. You had about 200 basis points into the fourth quarter, just wondering if there is anything from margin perspective or spending that was unique to the fourth quarter that carries on into 2018. Thank you so much.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes sure David. I think, first of all in terms of as you think about sort of earnings bridge from 2017 to 2018, you are right there probably are a number of tailwinds and some headwinds that certainly go away. I think in any one given years we look at 2018, we do have some positives and those would include FX, those would include recovering Sage, it would include Mako performance where we are on product cycles. We also have some challenges especially around the Spine market and changes in the tax laws that go the other way. I think the other thing we need to consider is that, at the beginning of the year, there are probably things that we don\u2019t even have visibility to that will certainly impact us during the year and we learned that lesson in 2017 for sure.", "So, as I think about our guidance for 2018 at this point where we are in the, we\u2019re targeting first of all sales growth that is at the highest level we have ever targeted at the beginning of any year. And we\u2019ve also targeted an EPS range that bracket sort of at the low end 9%, and at the high end in excess of 10.4%. And I think that more than supports the commitments that we have to delivering sales growth at the high-end of med tech and leverage earnings gains.", "Certainly, as the year unfolds, we\u2019ll continue to assess the targets, but we have high degree of conviction ability to deliver on the commitments that we\u2019ve laid out.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Michael Weinstein", "Thanks for taking the questions. Let me just start with on the margins. So first up, the fourth quarter as I understood your commentary so if you report a 70 basis point contraction relative to the kind of the street, but what you are saying is that if you back out Puerto Rico impact and the Sage impact and exclude the NOVADAQ dilution, your operating margin would have been up 30 basis points year-over-year? That\u2019s question one. And then question two, I want to make sure, I understood the 30 to 50 basis point commentary on margin improvement for 2018? Thanks.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Sure, your understanding is exactly correct. If I remove the one-time expenses related to the Puerto Rico manufacturing facility that hit within margin, if I also adjust for the loss of Sage sales and then lastly if I remove the dilution that came from NOVADAQ we would have delivered 30 basis points up margin improvement. And then as it relates to the 30 or 50 basis points guidance that we are providing for 2018, I feel like as I think about that guidance, I feel very strong and very committed that we will deliver within that range the 30 to 50 basis points and maybe to the at least to the midpoint of that.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay and that\u2019s a 30 to 50 basis points including, the headwinds of Intelius and NOVADAQ margin dilution?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Correct.", "Michael Weinstein", "Okay that\u2019s really helpful and then one last question for you. So, on the competitor call this morning, in the basis they look fourth quarter was really strong which we\u2019ve seen from multiple players obviously you guys had a fantastic fourth quarter. Are you assuming that the first quarter just because, the fourth quarter was so strong and first quarter just naturally going to be a little bit weaker, and are you seeing that and also are you seeing the impact from the UK that they talk about this morning and then later I just jump in? Thanks.", "Katherine Owen", "Thanks Mike. A couple of comments, clearly the fourth quarter was a strong quarter and if we look at our recon business, we\u2019re obviously really pleased, but it was really about share gains and we grew based on what we know from whose reported over three times the rate of the overall market. When we look at the market if we\u2019re around 3% and that looks very comparable, again I\u2019m talking about U.S. recon growth a very comparable to the year ago quarter. So, we didn\u2019t see any excess seasonality in the fourth quarter, what we did see is the real beginnings of departure in our market share gains and greater share shift. And that\u2019s really the focus, Q1 we have one less selling day, so I would note that we have one extra selling day in the second quarter. So no change for the full year.", "The UK has started to put some restrictions on electric procedures due to flu, I would put that in the incremental headwind, but that does it materially change our view on seasonality. Now Q4 is seasonally the strongest, Q1 is seasonally the weakest, but that\u2019s not anything we expect to be different from prior years. And again the focus we have is really much more on market share gains, because if we can grow 3, 3.5 times of market, if obviously has a much bigger impact for us than a 10s of basis points swings to the positive or negative from either hurricanes or UK procedural slowdown. So nothing that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s different either for the fourth quarter or our expectations be what I said for the first quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Bob Hopkins", "Hi thanks and good afternoon. Congrats on all the success with Mako, I want to start there if okay. I apologize if I missed this, and I know at the end of the third quarter call you said you did roughly 4,500 procedures with Mako and I know you gave an annual number. But can you give us a sense for what the Q4 procedure number was for Mako relative to that 4,500 in Q3 and then also maybe highlight what kind of what data we should expect at AOS?", "Katherine Owen", "Bob, I\u2019ll follow-up with you offline, I don\u2019t have the quarterly breakdown in front of me at the moment and some of that keep in mind the 42,500 that was for all. Mako procedures in 2017 and that compared to the 22,000 the prior year, but I offline, I can give you the quarterly breakdown for the procedures for knees and the total volume. Clearly at academy there will be a big focus again will be on Mako what we are seeing in terms of physicians feedback, I think you\u2019re going to start to see more of the clinical data as we get closer to the back-half of the year at some of the key opinion leaders and their early clinical trials that they were doing. We start to get more of that data, so our guess will be bigger with respect to clinical data, but I would imagine that we\u2019re going to have some papers and postures available, we did touch on this in on the third quarter call. So expect some of it at AOS and again obviously longer randomized clinical data will take longer, but you are going to start to see that materialize throughout 2018.", "Bob Hopkins", "Okay great, and then one for Glenn. Glenn two quick things; one, can you just give us an update on both Sage and Physio and kind of where we are right now given the issues that we that you had in 2017? And then also I was just wondering if you could quantify the EPS headwinds that are sort of one-time in nature in 2018, I know you talked about Intelius, but just if you could quantify the other kind of one-time EPS headwinds in 2018 that would be much appreciated?. Thank you.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "So as it relates to Sage and Physio as I mentioned in my script, over the course of Q4 we were able to go back to market with all major product families for them. So that was a big win, and we continue to see some ramping. I will also say that in Q4 the sales loss of $30 million was less than the sales loss we were anticipating. So that was a good sign too. I still anticipate a fair amount of ramping and working to do in 2018. In terms of Physio, Physio finished very strong in Q4 in fact their growth was accretive to the overall medical business. So we were very pleased with where Physio finished up the year. And then lastly on EPS, I did list out sort of some of those headwinds were and what we expected essentially the Spine market, I also talked about acquisitions that we have, Intelius we did quantify at $0.04, I think NOVADAQ we obviously said would be nominal, so there wouldn\u2019t be a really big impact on NOVADAQ. And then we didn\u2019t quantify any others.", "Katherine Owen", "And Bob, we had Total Knee procedures in the fourth quarter on Mako is about 7,000.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line Chris Pasquale with Guggenheim. Your line is now open.", "Chris Pasquale", "Thanks and congrats on the quarter. Just to circle back on Medical and the strong performance there. Can you quantify it all how much Physio might have benefited from some of the competitor issues, you talked about that being very strong to finish out the year and I would guess that contributed to that strength?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. It\u2019s difficult to totaling that number, but clearly some of the competitive challenges did help our business overall. We have also launched some new products outside the U.S. that\u2019s contributing to the momentum. And it\u2019s been part of Stryker for well over a year now, so we\u2019d really integrated that organization and feel really good about the ability for them to drive the type of sales synergy that we had really expected at the time of the acquisition. So no doubt there is a benefit, but it\u2019s certainly not the only factor contributing to the strong performance.", "Chris Pasquale", "Okay. And then. how you are thinking about the Spine business in 2018. You talked about some of the market challenges there, does that get better at some point or you thinking about portfolio additions that could help differentiate your back from competitors?", "Katherine Owen", "So it\u2019s clear the market remains challenged when you look at the traditional spinal hardware business, our IVF business were seeing good growth, but that Spine market overall the conditions remain difficult. And I think we\u2019re just going to have to be cautious and conservative around our expectations for 2018, because the whole market is seeing some of these difficulties. So, we\u2019re going to continue to invest there and we\u2019re committed to the Spine market, we\u2019ve got a great organization there. Fortunately we\u2019re big enough company there; we can manage through some of these challenges and still market the necessary investments. But in terms of predicting a market rebound here improvement, it\u2019s just too challenging right now to have any certainty around that. So, until we see evidence to the contrary we\u2019re going to assume this year remains challenged.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Rick Wise", "Thanks good afternoon everybody. Maybe start off with a couple of Mako questions. I mean obviously you\u2019ve got the TKA approval, how do we think about the potential opportunity should be dialing into Japan us an incremental Mako opportunity. How do we think about the next couple of years?", "Katherine Owen", "So, I think for 2018 the focus for our organization right now is completing the upgrades of the majority of the systems that are in the field in the U.S. and there is a lot more that\u2019s gone into that and that should be done this year that will allow the organization that should focus strictly to new installations and as I mentioned we expect double digit growth there. We did sell the first robot into Japan, but we are not expecting the Total Knee application until later this year. So I would really look at that opportunity as after 2018. We\u2019ve got a lot of runway in front of us. We penetrated about 10% of our customer base and we expect the momentum only to continue to grow as we get into competitive accounts as we continue to gain more clinical data, more clinician support, getting into these academic centers is obviously a big win, because it underscores the clinical value here.", "So, we\u2019re going to keep with the game plan that\u2019s been working well and continue to execute on the Mako application and I think you should view Japan as something that\u2019s a longer term opportunity, an important one that probably not significant with respect to the revenue contribution for 2018.", "Rick Wise", "And Kevin just thinking about M&A, you did what deal you are still adjusting NOVADAQ you got work to do, are you still on the M&A front, do you sense there is opportunity still what how are you thinking about capital deployment in 2018? Thank you.", "Kevin Lobo", "Thanks Rick. There is really no change to our capital allocations strategy. So acquisitions continue to be our preferred use of cash. The beauty of our decentralized business model is you can have a NOVADAQ going on with an endoscopy and then you can also have and Intelius going on with an instrument. So we have multiple divisions at their own business development teams that are constantly scaring the market for deals. We have a very good deal pipeline and that continues to be strong and that will be our favorite used. And so, I would say we\u2019re continuing to be very open for business on deals that are going to be value creating. And we continue to turn down most of the deals that we look at. And that\u2019s not new. So, this offer that we had in place now for 6, 7 years we expect to continue going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Kristen Stewart", "Hi good evening, thanks for taking the question. One for Glenn and then one for Kevin. Glenn, just in terms of the liabilities, just thinking about those [indiscernible] hips and then also tax, how should one think about the timing of cash outflows over the next couple of years?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes Kristen the guidance is still forthcoming on exactly, especially the big liability which is the tax on accumulated earnings and profits, which is the $800 million liability that we booked. Right now the guidance says that\u2019s payable over 8 years. So, we expect that to spread very evenly over the 8 years, but we really won\u2019t see the liability decline or won\u2019t have definitive of guidance into the probably the latter half of this year.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay and then what about for the hip liability on rejuvenating maybe\u2026", "Glenn Boehnlein", "You know what we settled phase 2 this year and you would see that in our cash flow and as I think about the liability, it\u2019s generally winding down. And I think you\u2019ll see that in our 10-K disclosures.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay, so the cash flow on that should be winding out?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes, it will merely the liability that\u2019s remaining that\u2019s what we\u2019re anticipating.", "Kristen Stewart", "Okay. And then Kevin, how should we just think about to the extent that the organic growth guidance proves to be little bit on the conservative side has been for the last couple of years. Would you be inclined to reinvest some of the upside back into the business or lot of flow through at the bottom-line?", "Kevin Lobo", "Kristen, I have just seen in prior years, we\u2019ve revised both our sales and EPS and in 2017 that was despite facing lot of challenges. We still did raise our EPS. You should look at 2018 no differently. So to the degree that top-line does come in stronger than we\u2019re currently targeting you should expect that it would translate to incremental leverage at the bottom-line. Now we make look to make some investments based on opportunities, but clearly we\u2019ve shown that we will met at the net leverage flow to the bottom-line and that would be our expectation again this year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with SunTrust. Your line is now open.", "Bruce Nudell", "Thank you for taking the question. Katherine, could you just quantify the number of TKA, Mako TKAs year-to-date and maybe comment a little bit about the U.S. ex-U.S. split as well as whether there is any ASP upside with the [indiscernible] of the Mako system, on a per case basis?", "Katherine Owen", "Okay, so there, in terms of the total Mako knee procedures for last year it was just under 16,000, so 15,778 to be exact and about just a tad over 7,000 in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s all in all procedures on total knee procedures. There is some modest incremental cost associated with Mako, but I think I would call out as being meaningful.", "Bruce Nudell", "Okay. And then\u2026", "Kevin Lobo", "Bruce you are asking just, I want to be clear Bruce are you asking about how many robots are equipped?", "Bruce Nudell", "No, no I was asking, was the sleeve that protects the arm and the, instruments that sort of start?", "Kevin Lobo", "Obviously there are disposables that come with it, we do sell those at pretty modest cost and are not high margin products.", "Bruce Nudell", "Okay great, and then Kevin just to follow-up because they are not anniversary yet, could you give us a feel for the kind of intrusive growth rates of the NOVADAQ and Intelius franchises?", "Katherine Owen", "So if we look at both of those, we expect if you take NOVADAQ first, we have fully integrated that. We did a lot of that heavy lifting in the fourth quarter of 2017. So we are well positioned now for NOVADAQ. We\u2019ve got the sales force fully aligned, the teams are fully integrated, we\u2019ve got aligned incentive. So that\u2019s really important in terms of making sure we don\u2019t have any internal competition or competing priorities.", "So they are well positioned at the start of this year to go after business and drive sales synergies and we expect it to be accretive to our overall revenue growth. We haven\u2019t put out targets for NOVADAQ, but certainly we expect in the hands of endo and with our combined sales force that would be accretive to our overall growth. And the similar expectation for Intelius we have an ENT presence; we had some product gaps in the portfolio. We get a well established sales force and that\u2019s certainly as we start to drive synergies in that and integrate it we need to close it first. But after we do that similar story as NOVADAQ should absolutely be accretive to our overall revenue growth and we\u2019ll be able to give some color commentary as we get further into that integration post closing.", "Kevin Lobo", "Right and obviously both were separately traded public companies and you could see the results when they were reporting them before our acquisition growing north of 15% quarter-after-quarter and we would expect that we\u2019d continue to fuel their growth and then also be able to pull through additional revenue through Stryker. And as Katherine said, throughout the course of 2018 we\u2019ll provide update, so I am very pleased with the initial integration of NOVADAQ. And certainly getting the sales force all lined up early in 2018 as probably one of the fastest integrations we\u2019ve had since I\u2019ve been at Stryker, so I really look forward to a good year in Endoscopy in 2018.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Raj Denhoy with Jefferies. Your line is now open.", "Raj Denhoy", "Hi good afternoon. I wonder if I could ask a bit about the cementless knee trajectories, you noted 24% in the quarter, so two questions on that. One, what sort of price premium are you getting on cementless at this point and where do you think that penetration can top out you over time?", "Katherine Owen", "So as Kevin mentioned, we exited the year at 24% penetration and it\u2019s obviously been ramping nicely, keep in mind though we did a very methodical slow launch initially. This was a paradigm shift for surgeons and we really wanted to make sure that they were seeing the results that would allow us to drive the type of uptake we\u2019re seeing now. But at 24% it\u2019s clearly resonating well with our surgeon base, it\u2019s tough to know how high it\u2019s going to go. We\u2019re just going to have to wait and see its different than doing a hip there was a more concern initially, clearly getting the approval to do the Mako with the cementless knee is a big plus, because the great the precision of the cuts, the greater that press fit ability. So it\u2019s a plus, I would tell you we absolutely expected to continue to ramp up in greater penetration throughout 2018. So, we don\u2019t think we have topped this out. We do get a premium publicly roughly 10% for that product offering.", "Raj Denhoy", "Okay, and then just follow-up, you mentioned the Mako, sort of the penetration of this in Mako, what percentage of Mako procedures are using cementless at this point?", "Katherine Owen", "It\u2019s pretty small, so is there were some surgeons who are doing it prior to us getting the approval, but that was off-label and it was absolutely the minority and certainly nothing that we were promoting. We only just got the indication in the fourth quarter. So, the vast majority of the cementless needs that have been implanted has been done the traditional open surgery approach.", "Kevin Lobo", "And we do believe the combination of robotics and 3D-printing is really powerful. Because born perhaps having a precise robotic assisted cut is really going to help enable that press fit just to emphasize Katherine\u2019s point, the two together we think our very synergistic and we do expect the cementless portion of Mako procedures to increase pretty dramatically.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Brien with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess Kevin or Katherine just thinking about the share gains in knees specifically, you mentioned what you're doing versus the market. But how do you think about keeping that share and necessarily in 2018 here seems like you've got the pretty good runway. But, heading into 2019 and beyond, is it the Mako angle that will help you keep share something else on the traditional side that will allow you to keep share. Just how do we think about you continuing this divergence away from the market as far as share gains go?", "Katherine Owen", "I think the runway for Mako and the total knee application really goes far beyond 2018. So I think you'll hear a very similar focus from us as we go into 2019, as we know that we've only penetrated about 10% of our customer base. We've just started to gather the clinical data that we think will really help drive future waves of adoption and so there's a lot of runway we would call this a multi-year story. We're very excited about 3D printing, our dedicated facility in Ireland what we've been able to do in recent years with those -- that product offering in knees and spine. And so 3D printing is going to absolutely remain a big part of the story for our reconstructive group and for Stryker more broadly.", "Matthew O'Brien", "Okay. And then Kevin I ask you about this every single quarter, but in looking at the trauma and extremities performance that it's the best that you've seen in the last 13 quarters. That business is now getting to be bigger than hips, it's getting to be as big as knees. Can you talk a little bit about the acceleration there? And then, by my math your 17%, 18% market share in trauma and extremities where can that go over the next several years, can you be a third of this market?", "Kevin Lobo", "Thanks for the question. We're delighted with the performance of our trauma and extremities business and as you know this has not been a one quarter story. This has been about a four or five year story once we really filled out our product offering.", "Our foot and ankle has course been a real engine of growth where we're growing significantly above the market in that substantial-segment we're starting to grow in upper extremities. So our shoulder business had a very good year in 2017. It's still a very small market share from a small base we are growing very well. That still has significant room for us to grow.", "We now have a primary shoulder; we have a reverse shoulder; we have a fracture system, but we still don't have a full offering be it a short stem or stemless. But, we have the core offering to really start to grow within shoulder. That's certainly part of the story converting full accounts has been really an engine of growth in the last couple of years. So four, five years ago, we were we were making headway in foot and ankle and a few other areas, but now we have the full offering and can convert entire accounts.", "So we're delighted with our focus on dedicated sales reps, dedicated management, dedicated marketing, dedicated business development R&D that business unit dedication has clearly been working and we expect it to continue. Can we continue to grow at such a divergence from the market? I'm not sure. But, do expect to continue to outpace the market.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Glenn Novarro", "Hi, good afternoon. Kevin, one of the quick question on your revenue guidance for 2018, you're guiding to 6% to 6.5%. I know it's a very strong guide but in 2017 you put up 7% growth. And I know some businesses have tough comps, but there's an easier comp with Sage; there's going to be an easier comp created by Puerto Rico and the hurricanes. So, is there anything that you want to call out that that's worrying you for 2018 or are you feeling at this point of the year, it's just better to be conservative? And then, I had a question on international knees and hips.", "Kevin Lobo", "So look it is early in the year, we do have big comps in a number of areas. I think when you look at our product cycles, we have a number of product cycles that are really starting to accelerate. And then, you have something like 1588, which is not really it sort of in the later stages of its cycle. So there isn't anything really big that I would call out. I think growing north of 6% on over $12 billion of revenue is a pretty good guide. But no specific worries or causes for concern. And if we continue with the kind of momentum we have certainly we'd look to update our guidance at some point in the year. But every year starts out and there's things that are going to happen that you don't know. And we feel this is a very appropriate guide. But, the reason for narrowing the guide a little bit in past years we've had a wider guide on sales.", "I really feel good about the balance that we have across our divisions and the balance across our geographies. It's probably the most balanced position we've been in since I've been at Stryker. And so that causes us to feel a lot more confident certainly on the lower end of the range than we have in the past.", "Glenn Novarro", "Okay. And then, let me just follow up with the performance of international knees and hips. It lagged U.S. and I know you called out Europe for a good performance but one of your competitors talked about pricing pressure in India, pricing pressure in China; China reducing inventory levels. Did you guys see that in the fourth quarter? And if so, when does it resolve? Thanks.", "A - Glenn Boehnlein", "Sure. We definitely saw the same issues. India is of course a dramatic knee cut -- price cut of around 70% which is government mandated, so everybody felt that. Fortunately for Stryker, we have a pretty small market share in India. So while it did hurt us, it probably didn't hurt us to the same degree that it hurt others. China is a bit of a different story where you are moving to the two invoice policy and there are regional tendering going on. It's not quite as dramatic an impact as it is in India. And we are very encouraged about our China business. We have a new leader that we put in place in China in Q4. He's strengthening the team and feeling very good about our prospects in China.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.", "Larry Biegelsen", "Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions. One on Neurotech, one on Robotics. Surprisingly, no questions yet on Neurotech, which I think was your fastest growing business in the fourth quarter. So Kevin maybe you can talk a little bit about what drove that. How much ischemic stroke is contributing to that and the outlook there given all the positive data we've just recently seen in the updated guidelines. And I had one follow up.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. I know we were really excited, our neurovascular business has performed extremely well in the past four years. And ischemic stroke is clearly one of the engines of growth. We're thrilled that the treatment guidelines have been extended from six hours and now up to 24 hours. Some of the studies are 16 hours summer 24 hours that extension certainly should help expand the market.", "You're also seeing other clinical studies come out around aspiration and so competitive activity certainly is intensifying in the space. But we believe it's a big market expansion story that will continue in the years ahead. We also had very good growth in our other two Neurotech businesses, our CMS business had double-digit growth and that's been a fantastic smaller business for us, but really steady performer. And our neuro-powered instruments as -- we launched the signature power drills that are just performing exceptionally well.", "So really all three legs of the Neurotech stool have been performing very, very well for us. But the biggest clear upside as you think about the next five years is ischemic stroke. And we are just at the early stages of that market. And every participant is going to be benefiting as that is a market expansion story.", "Larry Biegelsen", "That's helpful. And then, Kevin one strategic question for you. Given the success you're having with Mako what's your interest in Robotics outside of orthopedics i.e., for soft tissue. It would seem to make some strategic sense for Stryker given your other offerings. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes, thanks. Look we really have a huge opportunity in front of us in hard tissue. So I would tell you that our focus for the short-term, medium-term at least medium term maybe even long-term is going to be in hard tissue. We're really focused on hips and knees right now. There are other applications that you can imagine and other joints even within knees you could imagine moving towards bicruciate retaining and other types of procedures even within the existing joints.", "So the runway is significant in hard tissue that is going to be our main focus for the short-and medium term. One day could there be something in soft tissues perhaps, but it really isn't a major focus within our company right now.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Joanne Wuensch with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Good afternoon. And thank you for taking the question and very nice quarter particularly in knees. Can we step back for a moment and when you talk about the halo effect of Mako, we're looking at your whole recon business really moving forward nicely. What is that halo effect? Is it just for knees or how broad is it spreading?", "Katherine Owen", "Hi, Joanne. I would say right now it is primarily knees. It's being able to get into competitive accounts where we either have no market share or where our market share is well below the average. And the first thing surgeons do or adopting Makos start to use our Triathlon knee system and so that's all either new or incremental revenue. And then, as they start to use Mako, it's obviously a closed system. And then, the sales force -- once the sales rep gets in, they're going to sell the entire portfolio. And so, I would say the majority of the halo effect that we referenced is more around the knee business than anything else right now.", "Kevin Lobo", "But I am excited about the launch of our Trident 2 hip cup. So we are in limited launch last couple of years and we're now moving into full launch. And that hip cup its 3D printed hip cup would really that combined with Mako will be very compelling. Most surgeons as you know are happy with their hip outcomes. So they not necessarily believing that the robotic assistance will really help them until they try it. And then, they realize it can be very powerful.", "So I'm hopeful that the launch of the new cup will also create a little bit of extra energy around hips with Mako. But the killer application which we've said really from day one from the time we acquired Mako was going to be total knee given the level of dissatisfaction, the challenge of balancing a knee and everything that that Mako provides really does help the surgeon and the feedback that we're getting from them is, it really does produce better outcomes for them.", "Obviously, we're in the process of trying to quantify that and trying to produce the evidence for that. But as we've done in the partial knee and shown that evidence that's our intention with the total knee.", "Joanne Wuensch", "Thank you. That's helpful. And as a follow up question, big picture orthopedics, volume seem to have a tough quarter in third quarter came back fourth quarter. Are we starting to see more and more procedures shoveled onto -- shoveled is a wrong word, but moved onto sort of the ends -- the bookends of the year? I mean is that, is that how we should lay out our quarters at least in recon for the 2018 timeframe? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. I don't think you should assume any big divergence from historical trends. Q4 is seasonally strong; Q3 was a particularly funky quarter in 2017 with three major hurricanes that clearly had disruption for us and others. And we have big market shares in those areas. So I wouldn't read too much into Q3 volumes being lighter, I think it was just one of those quarters where there was some specific events that took place. And again, as we mentioned we're not expecting anything unique in the first quarter. Everybody knows where we've got tough comparisons. There's one less selling day as we mentioned U.K. has got some challenges. But every quarter always has some type of challenge. I don't think you should be assuming any big difference when you look at the quarterly growth rates other than keeping an eye out obviously for year-over-year comps.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro", "Good afternoon guys. Thanks. Question on margins, I think in the past you've talked about that 30 to 50 basis points annually and if we look past sort of the noise currently. What needs to happen to hit the higher end of the range given the portfolio changes you guys have made? Is it simply a function of top line growth or are there some longer lived programs that we haven't spent time on today that you guys can point to that will release more leverage over time?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes. Hi. That's a good question. As I think about 30 to 50 basis points and I look at what programs are covered within that. I don't think there's an opportunity to accelerate those programs to drive faster savings. I do think that in programs like our indirect spend program we are maximizing the amount of savings that we can drive. We'll enter a new phase for HR and finance shared services in the upcoming year that will contribute more to that equation. So I really think about it in terms of delivering top line at the upper end of the range will also provide sort of more significant drop through and that will increase the up margin range to closer to 50 basis points.", "Isaac Ro", "Okay, great. And then, maybe a follow up on Intelius. It's obviously interesting new therapy there and I'm interested in the competitive landscape and how you guys plan to differentiate as you guys unless you take ownership of that asset? Thank you.", "Katherine Owen", "I think the big opportunity there is, we had a presence in the ENT market. We've been in that space for a number of years within our instruments division. But it wasn't big enough to really carve it out and establish as a standalone ENT group. This really is a catalyst to do that. It's been a very effective strategy for us. We've done it numerous times within our instruments group. We believe focus drives results. So using this to really fill out the portfolio of ENT products we are going to have a very comprehensive bag. We're buying an established sales force, we're going to integrate it with our own talent, invest in it invest in that dedicated sales force. This is very core to Stryker's overall strategy and we believe as we move through that process we'll be able to drive sales synergies. So it's going to be focus being able to establish a dedicated sales force. We have terrific leadership within our instruments group and now we'll have a comprehensive product portfolio to really compete very effectively in the ENT space.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kyle Rose with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.", "Kyle Rose", "Great. Thank you very much for taking the questions and congrats on a strong finish to 2017. So a lots really been asked, but I just wanted to kind of take a step back on the MedSurg side and just maybe you can provide your perspective on the hospital CapEx environment and just where we are from an investment perspective there?", "And then, any additional updates as far as the product cycles across both instruments as well as endoscopy with the 1588 camera there? That would be very helpful.", "Katherine Owen", "Sure. We too are really very upbeat around the CapEx environment. You saw another strong quarter within our medical which is our most capital intensive business for their core bedding structure business. We also saw a great quarter for physio, which is a large capital component. So overall that market seems the very least stable. But clearly, I think what our results are reflecting is that where we're taking market share within those segments.", "If you look at endoscopy they have just had the second year anniversary of the 1588 launch so that was obviously a highly successful launch for that group. I think if you think about 2018, it's really going to be about driving as NOVADAQ synergies as we have now -- as we mentioned earlier integrated the sales force and there's a lot of opportunity. So for the extend 1588 and get into new accounts through our combined sales presence.", "Instruments -- the big products launch right now is system A. We're really pleased with that. You could clearly see it with the results, double-digit growth or instruments in the quarter and that's in the first year of launch. So they've got some good runway ahead of them and certainly it'll be one of the standouts for that division within -- for 2018.", "Glenn Boehnlein", "And if you look at our MedSurg business, which we rarely get a lot of questions about. Just look at the absolute performance, the growth in the quarter, the growth in the full year, the growth the last three years. I mean this is becoming a really high growth segment of the company and very consistent year after.", "Now, it does vary from division to division based on the timing of product cycles, but through the acquisitions that we're bringing into the MedSurg group. We really are turning that full group into a growth engine for the overall company. And it was consistent before but now with the outperformance that we have versus the market is pretty meaningful.", "Kyle Rose", "Thank you very much for taking the question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen. Your line is now open.", "Josh Jennings", "Good evening. Thanks a lot. I was hoping to just circle back on margin guidance for 2018. I think you laid out absorption of Intelius and NOVADAQ potentially margin dilutive same level of spend into the CTG program and potentially into the midpoint of that 30 to 50. Should we be thinking about a margin outperformance in 2018 within that range towards the top end of that 30 to 50 range or is there a comparison issue that we should be thinking about as well?", "Glenn Boehnlein", "Yes. No, I think you know where we are in the year and providing guidance at the beginning of the year. I think it's more safe to probably target the middle of that range than the upper end of that range. As I said as we look to sales performance and things like Sage coming back and ramping up, bringing our Puerto Rico facility back up to 100%. Those things will give us more confidence that we potentially could be to the upper end of that range.", "Josh Jennings", "I guess maybe just trying to be clear about the headwinds that you're facing with the acquisitions same level of spend. Is that 30 to 50 actually a higher range considering the headwinds you're facing or there is a comparison from 2017 offset those headwinds?", "Kevin Lobo", "Yes. No, really the comparison from 2017 is a pretty direct offset to the same headwind. So we really are bracketing the 30 to 50 basis points about margin improvement.", "Josh Jennings", "Okay. Thanks for that. And one other follow up with the Mako question and then just in terms of systems place. Are you getting any penetration into ambulatory surgical centers, knee replacements are off the inpatient only list? Our understanding is that, ASCs still can't get reimbursed from Medicare, but also any comments here in terms of how you are positioned for the potential eventuality of recon procedures moving into those facilities. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Katherine Owen", "Sure. You are correct around the reimbursement and not being available in ambulatory surgery center. We have had to make replacement sales into that setting, but the vast majority is still in the hospital setting. We do think you're going to see a shift of procedures, but it's going to be gradual. You really have to target the ideal patient and a lot of these patients have challenges associated with other conditions that that don't suit them well to that setting. And I think the industry is still working through how to make sure they've got the right protocols in place.", "So short answer, yes, we have sold some, but the vast majority are in the hospital setting and I think that will be the trend this year as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Kaila Krum with William Blair. Your line is open.", "Kaila Krum", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking our question. So a follow-up on your response to Larry's question on Robotics. It sounds like you still have a lot of opportunity in total knees and other applications within orthopedics, we would imagine spine. I mean can you just walk us through sort of that what that development process would entail to extend Mako into those other categories just in theory?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. At this point it's really too early for us to give a whole lot of visibility into the Mako pipeline. We have a lot of work to do given we've penetrated about 10% of our customers for the total knee. And that's where we want our team's focus to be. We obviously have some R&D programs underway. You've heard Kevin talk about opportunities in other joints and we do think that eventually could include spine, but it's a little early right now and we really want to make sure the focus is and truly optimizing the opportunity given the size of it for the total knee. But clearly opportunity longer term in other joints.", "Kaila Krum", "Thanks Catherine. And then, just on spine, can you guys talk a little bit about what sort of foundational efforts you're putting into place today. Just to help recover the growth profile there. I mean have you found this business to have become even less of a priority just in terms of near term investment given some of the market growth headwinds we've seen in that area?", "Kevin Lobo", "No. Actually, we on the contrary, this is a business that really responds well to innovation. We've seen that ourselves when we've had the right innovation that we bring to the market if we grow and we grow faster than the market. We launched our second Tritanium products cervical, in the fourth quarter we launched a new pedicle screw system called Serrato in the second half of the year, we're seeing a very nice up tick from those products. So if anything we're actually continuing to invest in even increasing the amount of R&D investment in the spine business.", "We're very committed to it long-term. We believe it's a very important. It's the largest orthopedic market. There are huge unmet needs. It's connected as you see with 3D printing, we're able to leverage that technology across not just spine, but also hips and knees. So there's a lot of sharing of technologies there. It's part of the Neurotech group of many hospitals and part of their service line. So we remain committed to it. We're investing in innovation; innovation does drive growth, but we have to be realistic, it is a tough market. The market conditions aren't great, but we are very committed to the business and we really believe innovation is the way to continue to grow in spine.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Craig Bijou with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.", "Craig Bijou", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of quick ones on Mako. I wanted to talk about or I wanted to ask about the 20% of competitive surgeons who are using Triathlon for the first time. I think that's a new metric that you guys have provided. So just wanted to get your sense for when you talked about taking market share, the 100s of basis points? How does that 20% compared to your expectations? And then, where can we see that going forward?", "Katherine Owen", "Yes. I think overall we've been really pleased with the launch and the ramp that we're seeing both in getting into competitive accounts as well as being able to upgrade robots in the field and install new robots. And so it's the combination, you're growing 3.5x the overall market clearly that's coming from both getting into accounts that have never had Triathlon as well as other competitive accounts in our own customers.", "And so it's very difficult to break that apart in terms of the market share gains. It's a combined effect and I would say in terms of expectations we're just really pleased with how 2017 unfolded. And we've got a lot of work to do to continue the trajectory we expect to perform out for 2018.", "Craig Bijou", "Okay. Thanks for taking the question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Kevin Lobo for any closing remarks.", "Kevin Lobo", "So thank you all for joining our call. Our conference call for the first quarter 2018 results will be held on April 26. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.
